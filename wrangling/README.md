# Wrangling

* `sep_sections.py` contains code (separate_item) that will take a text file containing an entire 10-Q and save 6 new files containing: Items 1-4, Part 2, and Forward Looking Statements
* `retrieve_sentences.py` was used initially to retrieve the sentences directly from the SEC but is not used in the final pipeline. However, there are useful library functions to parse sentences that can be used for future work.
