Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 



We have no derivative instruments and minimal exposure to commodity market risks. A portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the U.S. and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the U.S. dollar. However, a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in U.S. dollars and therefore our foreign currency risk is not material at this date.
