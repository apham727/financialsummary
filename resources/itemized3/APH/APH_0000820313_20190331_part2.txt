 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  



 Item 1. Legal Proceedings  



 The Company has been named as a defendant in several legal actions arising from normal business activities. Although the potential liability with respect to certain of such legal actions cannot be reasonably estimated, none of such matters is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  



 In August 2018, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Inspector General, requesting documents pertaining to certain products manufactured by the Company’s Military and Aerospace Group that are purchased or used by the U.S. government. The Company is cooperating with the request. The inquiry remains in the early stages and the Company is unable to estimate the timing or outcome of the matter.  



 Item 1A. Risk Factors  



 There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors as disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s 2018 Annual Report.  



 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  



 Repurchase of Equity Securities  



 On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the 2018 stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2.0 billion of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 1.8 million shares of its Common Stock for $160.0 million under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases during the first quarter of 2019, approximately 1.0 million shares, or $87.6 million, have been retained in Treasury stock; the remaining 0.8 million shares, or $72.4 million, have been retired by the Company.  The Company has not repurchased any additional shares of its Common Stock through April 23, 2019, and has remaining authorization to purchase up to approximately $1,286.7 million of its Common Stock under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.
