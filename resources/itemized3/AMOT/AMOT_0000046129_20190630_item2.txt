Overview 





Financial overview 



Growth across all the Companys served markets led to leveraging of costs and expansion of margins. Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange (FX) of $2,010, second quarter revenue was $94,640, up 18.3%. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, excluding the unfavorable effects of FX of $5,150, revenue was $191,676, up 22.4%. Revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts is a non-GAAP measurement. Refer to information included in Non - GAAP Measures below for a reconciliation of revenue to revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts. 



Our One Allied strategy to gain market share with our unique ability to provide engineered solutions for our customers is the primary driver of our growth in 2019. Our business operating system, Allied Systematic Tools (AST), is contributing to

stronger margins. Improved product mix helped to overcome an ongoing supplier issue. Our recent acquisition, TCI continues to be a strong contributor to sales and earnings and has strategically expanded our market access. 



Operating Results 



Quarter ended June 30, 2019 compared to quarter ended June 30, 2018 











Sales to U.S. customers were 58% of total sales for the quarter compared with 52% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia. The overall increase in revenue was due to an 18.3% volume increase offset by a 2.5% unfavorable currency impact.

Non-GAAP Measures 



Revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. 



Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results; in particular, those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, and that are not a helpful measure of the performance of our underlying business particularly in light of their unpredictable nature. These non-GAAP disclosures have limitations as analytical tools, should not be viewed as a substitute for revenue and net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. In addition, supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Companys future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. 



The Company believes that revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts is a useful measure in analyzing organic sales results. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from revenue for this measure because currency translation is not under managements control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between the current period revenue and the current period revenue after applying foreign exchange rates from the prior period. 



The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as 





Table of Contents 



our provision for income tax expense. EBITDA is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the Companys industry. 



The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business. Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock compensation expense, as well as certain income or expenses which are not indicative of the ongoing performance of the Company. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 











Liquidity and Capital Resources 



The Companys liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents increased by $1,790 to a balance of $10,463 at June 30, 2019 from December 31, 2018. 





During the second quarter of 2019, the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a decrease in working capital needs primarily for inventories despite increased revenues along with higher levels of orders, particularly in the second quarter of 2019.

The significant cash used in investing activities in 2018 reflects the acquisition the Maval OE Steering business. Purchases of property and equipment were $6,401 during 2019 compared to $5,555 for 2018. The Company expects to invest between $15 million and $18 million in capital expenditures during 2019. 



During the first quarter of 2019, the Company utilized revolver borrowings to fund working capital to support the growth seen from fourth quarter 2018 along with the payment of annual incentive compensation amounts. During the second quarter of 2019, the Company made payments on the revolver that offset all but $695 of the 2019 borrowings. 



The cash used in financing activities in first quarter 2018 reflects the use of the revolver to partially finance the acquisition of the Maval OE Steering business. At June 30, 2019, we had $123,695 of obligations under the Revolving Facility excluding the unamortized debt issue costs. 



The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to minimum interest coverage and total leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. The Credit Agreement also includes other covenants and restrictions, including limits on the amount of additional indebtedness, and restrictions on the ability to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all our assets. We were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2019. 



As of June 30, 2019, the amount available to borrow under the Credit Agreement was approximately $51,305. The Credit Agreement matures in October 2021. 



There were no borrowings for the China Facility balance during the quarter ended June 30, 2019. 



The Company declared dividends of $0.030 per share during the first quarter 2019 and $0.030 per share during the second quarter of 2019. The Companys working capital, capital expenditure and dividend requirements are expected to be funded from cash provided by operations and amounts available under the Credit Agreement.
