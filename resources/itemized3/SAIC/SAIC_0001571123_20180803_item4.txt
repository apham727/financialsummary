Item 4. Controls and Procedures



Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and have concluded that as of August 3, 2018, these controls and procedures were operating and effective. 



Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



During the assessment process at February 2, 2018, we identified deficiencies in the operating effectiveness of controls over the training and awareness of contractual requirements related to multi-customer funding and the design of program control and time sheet review controls over contracts with multi-customer funding sources. These deficiencies were evaluated as having the potential to result in a material misstatement in our financial statements and aggregated to a material weakness in our internal controls. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, our management completed the remediation of the material weakness. Remediation efforts included improving the design of program control and time sheet review controls over contracts with multi-customer funding sources and increased training and awareness in the administration of such contracts.



Except for the remediation of the material weakness described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period covered by this report that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
