PART II Other Information 



Item 1: Legal Proceedings 



We are the subject of various pending or threatened legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. All such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance. In our opinion, as of June 30, 2018, there were no claims or litigation pending that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 



Item 1A: Risk Factors 





Conducting business in foreign countries involves additional financial, operating, and regulatory risks. 





Effective July 6, 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (“USTR”) imposed duties of 25% on certain Chinese imports containing industrially significant technologies, including certain PCTEL antenna and antenna components, and there are additional tariffs under review. Tariffs impact the gross margin that the Company earns on sales of its products and have necessitated price increases. Furthermore, political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures may have a negative effect on customer confidence and spending. The Company will continue to monitor and adjust prices as necessary and as market conditions permit. The impact of the tariffs on the Company’s future revenue and profitability is uncertain.
