Item 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 



The following information should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the “2017 Form 10-K”). Except for historical information, the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our anticipated revenues, profits, costs and expenses and revenue mix. These forward-looking statements include, among others, those statements including the words “may,” “will,” “plans,” “seeks,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “believes” and words of similar meaning. Such statements constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. No undue reliance should be placed on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. 



Our third quarter 2018 revenues of $18.4 million decreased by $5.2 million or 22.1% compared to revenues of $23.7 million for the same period in 2017. Revenues decreased for the Connected Solutions segment by $3.1 million or 17.3% and decreased for the RF Solutions segment by $2.2 million or 38.0% compared to the third quarter 2017. For the third quarter 2018, we recorded an operating loss of $2.4 million compared to operating profit of $0.9 million in the third quarter 2017. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $61.7 million declined by $6.4 million or 9.4% compared to revenues of $68.1 million for the same period in 2017. Revenues declined in the RF Solutions segment by $4.5 million or 27.6% and revenues declined in the Connected Solutions segment by $2.0 million or 3.8%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded an operating loss of $5.2 million compared to operating profit of $0.6 million during the same period in 2017. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded $0.7 million in restructuring expenses related to the reorganization of the Company. Restructuring expenses included $0.2 million in cost of revenues and $0.5 million in operating expenses, primarily related to employee severance and related benefits for U.S. headcount reductions.  



The decrease in revenues for the RF Solutions segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to lower capital spending by U.S. carriers and also lower revenues in the Asia Pacific region because 2017 included some larger projects in China. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the decrease in revenues for the Connected Solutions segment was due to lower sales in the industrial and public safety vertical markets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the decrease in revenues for the Connected Solutions segment was due to lower sales in the industrial and public safety vertical markets, offset by increased sales in the Enterprise Wi-Fi vertical market. The operating loss for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily the result of the negative gross margin impact of lower revenues generated by the RF Solutions segment and a lower gross margin percentage for the Connected Solutions segment. Operating expenses were lower for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 as lower general and administrative expenses offset higher research and development expenses.  



Introduction 



PCTEL delivers Performance Critical TELecom technology solutions to the wireless industry. We are a leading global supplier of wireless network antenna and testing solutions. The Connected Solutions segment designs and manufactures precision antennas. PCTEL antennas are deployed in small cells, enterprise Wi-Fi access points, fleet management and transit systems, and in network equipment and devices for the Industrial Internet of Things. The RF Solutions segment provides test tools that improve the performance of wireless networks globally. Mobile operators, neutral hosts, and equipment manufacturers rely on PCTEL to analyze, design, and optimize next generation wireless networks. 



Effective August 2018, we consolidated our organizational structure. Our operations, engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions were consolidated into a single enterprise-wide organizations. As a result of the reorganization that occurred in the third quarter 2018, our Chief Executive Officer, as the CODM, began assessing operating profits and identified assets at the enterprise level for resource allocations, and instead of segment managers, the Chief Operating Officer began reporting to and maintaining regular contact with the CODM to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, and plans for the entire business. All operating profit and cash flows are measured and managed at the enterprise level.  



Until the reorganization, PCTEL operated in two segments for reporting purposes, Connected Solutions and RF Solutions. Our CODM assessed operating profits and identified assets for the Connected Solutions and RF Solutions segments for resource allocations. Each segment had its own segment manager as well as its own engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions. We managed our balance sheet and cash flows centrally at the corporate level, with the exception of trade accounts receivable and inventory which was managed at the segment level. Each of the segment managers reported to and maintained regular contact with the chief operating decision maker to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, and plans for the segment. All of our accounting and finance, human resources, information technology (“IT”) and legal functions were provided on a centralized basis through the corporate function. 





Because the reorganization occurred during the third quarter 2018, this report has been prepared under the segment reporting structure that was in effect for all of 2017 and through August of 2018. Beginning with the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, we will not report any segment information. We will report revenue and gross profit for our two major product lines, Antenna Products and Test and Measurement Products.  



Generally, revenue growth for the Connected Solutions segment is driven by the increased use of wireless communications and increased complexity trends occurring in these markets. PCTEL antennas are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) providers where they are designed into the customer’s solution. PCTEL maintains expertise in several technology areas in order to be competitive in the antenna market. These include radio frequency engineering, mobile antenna design and manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering. 



Generally, revenue growth for the RF Solutions segment is driven by the implementation and roll out of new wireless technology standards (i.e., 3G to 4G, 4G to 5G, etc.). PCTEL test equipment is sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEMs who integrate our products into their solution, which is then sold to wireless carriers. PCTEL maintains expertise in several technology areas in order to be competitive in the test tool market. These include radio frequency engineering, digital signal processing engineering, manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering. 





Results of Operations 



Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 





Revenues by Segment 





Revenues decreased 22.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and decreased 9.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the decrease in revenues for the Connected Solutions segment was due to lower sales in the industrial and fleet vertical markets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the decrease in revenues for the Connected Solutions segment was due to lower sales in the industrial and public safety vertical markets, offset by increased sales in the Enterprise Wi-Fi vertical market. Revenues for the RF Solutions segment decreased 38.0% and 27.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017 primarily due to lower capital spending by U.S. carriers for legacy 4G wireless systems in preparation for the capital expenditures required for 5G deployments. RF Solutions revenues were also lower in the Asia Pacific region because 2017 included some large projects in China.  



Gross Profit by Segment 





The gross profit decreased by 640 basis points for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and decreased by 560 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. The declines in gross profit were due to a higher mix of revenues from the Connected Solutions segment as well as a decline in the gross profit percentage for the Connected Solutions segment. The gross profit for the Connected Solutions segment declined by 390 basis points and 380 basis points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, due to price pressure in the small cell vertical market and due to product mix. The three months ended September 30, 2018 included $0.2 million for severance and employee benefits related to manufacturing headcount reductions in the Connected Solutions segment. The gross profit for the RF Solutions segment decreased by 790 and 460 basis points for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017 primarily due to the impact of fixed costs over lower revenues. 





Consolidated Operating Expenses 





Research and Development 



Research and development expenses increased approximately $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and increased $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, expenses for the Connected Solutions segment were higher by $0.3 million and expenses for the RF Solutions segment were approximately the same compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 consists of higher expenses of $0.8 million for the Connected Solutions segment and higher expenses of $0.1 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in the prior year. Expenses for both segments were higher compared to the prior year periods due to additional headcount and equipment required to support investments in growth areas.  



Sales and Marketing 



Sales and marketing expenses include costs associated with the sales and marketing employees, sales agents, product line management, and trade show expenses.  



Sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately $0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, sales and marketing expenses were lower by $0.2 million for the RF Solutions segment and lower by $0.1 million for the Connected Solutions segment compared to the same period for each of the segments, respectively, in 2017. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, sales commissions were lower by $0.2 million and product line and marketing expenses for the RF Solutions segment were lower by $0.1 million compared to the same period in 2017. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, sales and marketing expenses for the Connected Solutions segment declined $0.4 million, offsetting higher sales and marketing expenses of $0.1 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in 2017. The expense decrease for the Connected Solutions segment is due to headcount reductions in sales and marketing at the end of the first quarter 2017. The expense increase for RF Solutions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was due to additions to sales and marketing headcount offset by lower sales commission expenses. 



General and Administrative 



General and administrative expenses include costs associated with the general management, finance, human resources, IT, legal, public company costs, and other operating expenses to the extent not otherwise allocated to business segments. 



General and administrative expenses declined by $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and declined by $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 because 2017 included incentive compensation expense and corporate expenses related to the CEO transition that were not included in 2018, offsetting expense related to the separation of the Senior Vice President and General Manager of the RF Solutions segment. . Incentive compensation expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively. Corporate expenses related to the CEO transition were $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. The Company recorded expense of $0.3 million in the third quarter 2018 related to the severance payment, employee benefits, and the acceleration of shares for this separation. 





Amortization of Intangible Assets 



Amortization expense within operating expenses was $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017. Amortization within operating expenses was $0.3 million and $0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in the expense for three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior year periods due to certain intangible assets for Connected Solutions being fully amortized as of June 30, 2018.  



Stock-based compensation expense 







Stock compensation expense was higher for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 due to the acceleration of service-based restricted shares pursuant to a separation agreement executed in the third quarter 2018 for the Senior Vice President and General Manager of the RF Solutions segment, as well as an increase in the number of share awards in 2018 compared to 2017 and a higher share price for the awards granted in 2018 compared to 2017. The Company recorded expense of $0.2 million within general and administrative expenses in the third quarter 2018 related to the acceleration of shares for the separation. 



Operating (Loss) Income by Segment 





We reported a total operating loss of $2.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2018 and an operating loss of $5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The operating losses were the result of lower profits for the RF Solutions segment and lower gross profits for the Connected Solutions segment. Due to lower revenues, we recorded operating losses of $1.0 million and $1.8 million for RF Solutions segment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to income for the same periods in 2017. Operating profit for the Connected Solutions segment was lower by approximately $1.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2018 and lower by $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage. Within the corporate function, expenses were lower by $0.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to lower expenses related to the Short-Term Incentive Plan and because the same periods in 2017 included expenses related to the CEO transition. 





Other Income, Net 





Other income, net consists of interest income, foreign exchange losses and gains, and interest expense. Interest income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher average interest rates but also due to higher investment and cash equivalent balances. Our investment and cash equivalent balances declined during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 but the average balance was higher through the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017.  



Benefit for Income Taxes 





We recorded an income tax benefit of $0.5 million and $1.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. The tax benefit recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 differed from the statutory rate of 21% by approximately 1%, because the Company did not record income tax benefits for losses with finite lives and due to permanent differences. The tax benefit recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 differed from the statutory rate of 34% by 44% due to the combination of U.S. pretax losses and foreign pretax profits taxed at lower rates. The net tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 included an income tax benefit of $0.2 million related to state rate and apportionment changes and an $0.1 million income tax benefit related to previously unrecognized tax benefits for research credits.  



We maintain valuation allowances due to uncertainties regarding realization. Our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was $5.4 million and $5.2 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Most of our deferred tax assets relate to the United States tax jurisdiction. On a regular basis, we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance. Such evaluations involve the application of significant judgment. The valuation allowance at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 relates to net operating losses (“NOLs”) and credits. We believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized based on the negative evidence of a cumulative three-year loss through September 30, 2018 and at December 31, 2017 and the finite expiration of state NOLs and credits and federal NOLs generated as of December 31, 2017. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to income taxes.  



Net (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax (Benefit) Expense 





During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we approved a plan to sell our Network Engineering Services business (“Engineering Services”) and shift our focus toward research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products. We sold the business to Gabe’s Construction on July 31, 2017. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to discontinued operations. The results for Engineering Services are reported as discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. The net income for the three months ended September 30, 2017 reflects a gain on the sale of the business of $0.5  





million, offsetting a net operating loss of $0.1 million and income tax expense of $0.2 million. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 reflects a net operating loss of $0.7 million, offsetting a gain on the sale of the business of $0.5 million.  



Liquidity and Capital Resources 







Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview 



Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations, with short-term swings in liquidity supported by a significant balance of cash and short-term investments. The balance has fluctuated with cash from operations, acquisitions and divestitures, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common shares. 



Within operating activities, we are historically a net generator of operating funds from our income statement activities. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our balance sheet provided operating funds. In periods of expansion, we expect to use cash from our balance sheet.  



Within investing activities, capital spending historically ranges between 2.0% and 4.0% of our revenues and the primary use of capital is for manufacturing and engineering development. Our capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 were approximately 3.6% of revenues. We historically have significant transfers between investments and cash as we rotate our large cash balances and short-term investment balances between money market funds, which are accounted for as cash equivalents, and other investment vehicles. We have a history of supplementing our organic revenue with acquisitions of product lines or companies, resulting in significant uses of our cash and short-term investment balances from time to time. We expect the historical trend for capital spending and the variability caused by moving money between cash and investments and periodic merger and acquisition activity to continue in the future. 



Within financing activities, we have historically generated funds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and have historically used funds to repurchase shares of our common stock through our share repurchase programs and through quarterly dividends. Whether this activity results in our being a net user of funds versus a net generator of funds is largely dependent on our stock price during any given year. 



At September 30, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were approximately $37.1 million, and we had working capital of $53.8 million. Management believes that our cash and investments and no debt, combined with our historic ability to generate free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital spending) provide adequate liquidity and working capital to support our operations. 





Operating activities generated $4.1 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. We generated $1.1 million of cash from our income statement activities and generated $3.0 million of cash from the balance sheet. Within the balance sheet, we generated cash primarily due to net collections of accounts receivable of $5.0 million, offsetting use of cash for net payments of accrued liabilities of $2.5 million. The reduction in accounts receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 is because revenues for the most recent quarter were $4.8 million lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Accrued liabilities were lower at  





September 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to the payout of $1.7 million for the 2017 short-term incentive plan.  



Operating activities from continuing operations provided $7.0 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. We generated $5.6 million of cash from our income statement activities and $1.5 million of cash from our balance sheet activities. From the balance sheet activities, we generated cash of $0.7 million from decreases in accounts receivable and $1.8 million from reductions in inventories and used cash of $0.4 million from reductions in accrued liabilities and $1.1 million from reductions in accounts payable. Inventories declined during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 for both Connected Solutions and RF Solutions due to process improvements related to purchasing and forecasting, as well as a decrease in revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. Accounts receivables declined during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 due to the decrease in revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. In total, accrued liabilities and accounts payable were lower by $1.1 million due to the reduction in amounts due for inventory purchases.  





Our investing activities used $1.5 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, redemptions and maturities of our short-term investments provided $34.7 million in funds and we rotated $34.0 million of cash into new short-term investments. We used $2.2 million for capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Capital expenditures included equipment for our new development office in Akron, Ohio. 



Our investing activities used $13.6 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, redemptions and maturities of our short-term investments provided $26.1 million in funds and we rotated $37.6 million of cash into new short-term investments. We used $2.1 million for capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Capital expenditures included $0.6 million for a new IP phone and communications system.  





We used $2.7 million in cash for financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. We used $3.0 million for cash dividends paid in February 2018, May 2018 and August 2018. We received $0.7 million in proceeds from the purchase of shares through our ESPP and we used $0.3 million for payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation and $0.1 million on payments for capital leases. The tax payments related to our stock issued for restricted stock awards. 



We used $2.6 million in cash for financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. We used $2.7 million for cash dividends and we received $1.4 million in proceeds from the purchase of shares through our ESPP and stock option exercises. We used $1.2 million for payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation. The tax payments related to our stock issued for restricted stock awards. 



Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 



We had purchase obligations of $6.1 million and $5.7 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. These obligations are for the purchase of inventory, as well as for other goods and services in the ordinary course of business and exclude the balances for purchases currently recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet. 



As of September 30, 2018, we had operating lease obligations of approximately $2.5 million through 2025, primarily for facility leases. We had capital lease obligations of $0.2 million and $0.3 million at September 30, 2018 and at December 31, 2017, respectively.  



We had a liability of $0.7 million related to income tax uncertainties at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. We do not know the timing of the settlement of this liability. 



U.S. Tariffs 



During the third quarter 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (“USTR”) imposed duties on certain Chinese imports containing industrially significant technologies, including certain PCTEL antenna and antenna components. Duties of 25% became effective on July 6, 2018 and on August 23, 2018 and duties of 10% on additional products became effective on September 24, 2018. The tariffs that became effective on September 24 will increase to 25% on January 1, 2019. These Tariffs increased the cost of the Company’s products, adversely impacting the gross margin that the Company earns on sales of its products and making our products more expensive for customers. During the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2018, $7.5 million of our customer  





revenues were based on products subject to the new tariffs. To recover the additional costs incurred because of these tariffs, we initiated a 20% upcharge to end customers of the products subject to the 25% tariffs. The Company will continue to monitor and adjust prices as necessary and as market conditions permit. However, the Company does not know the price elasticity of the unit volume based on the price increase.  



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 



We use certain critical accounting policies as described in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” of the 2017 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in any of our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2017. See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on recent accounting pronouncements and see Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to revenue recognition policies.
