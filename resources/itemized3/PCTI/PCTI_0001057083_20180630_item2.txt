Our second quarter 2018 revenues of $21.6 million increased by $0.1 million, or 0.4% compared to revenues of $21.5 million for the same period in 2017. Revenues increased for the Connected Solutions segment by $0.6 million or 3.6%, but these higher revenues were offset when revenues for the RF Solutions segment declined by $0.5 million or 11.3%. For the second quarter 2018, we recorded an operating loss of $1.6 million compared to an operating loss of $0.3 million in the second quarter 2017. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2018 of $43.3 million declined by $1.2 million or 2.6% compared to revenues of $44.5 million for the same period in 2017. Revenues declined in the RF Solutions segment by $2.3 million or 21.9%, but revenues increased in the Connected Solutions segment by $1.1 million or 3.2%. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded an operating loss of $2.8 million compared to an operating loss of $0.3 million during the same period in 2017. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the increase in revenues for the Connected Solutions segment was due to increased sales in the Enterprise Wi-Fi vertical market, while the decrease in revenues for the RF Solutions segment was primarily due to lower capital spending by U.S. carriers and also lower revenues in the Asia Pacific region because 2017 included some large projects in China and Japan. The operating loss for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily the result of the negative gross margin impact of lower revenues generated by the RF Solutions segment and a lower gross margin percentage for the Connected Solutions segment. Operating expenses were lower for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 as lower general and administrative expenses offset higher research and development expenses.  



Introduction 



PCTEL delivers Performance Critical TELecom technology solutions to the wireless industry. We are a leading global supplier of wireless network antenna and testing solutions. The Connected Solutions segment designs and manufactures precision antennas. PCTEL antennas are deployed in small cells, enterprise Wi-Fi access points, fleet management and transit systems, and in network equipment and devices for the Industrial Internet of Things. The RF Solutions segment provides test tools that improve the performance of wireless networks globally. Mobile operators, neutral hosts, and equipment manufacturers rely on PCTEL to analyze, design, and optimize next generation wireless networks. 



PCTEL operates in two segments for reporting purposes. Each segment has its own segment manager as well as its own engineering, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions. All of our accounting and finance, human resources, information technology (“IT”) and legal functions are provided on a centralized basis through the corporate function. 



Generally, revenue growth for the Connected Solutions segment is driven by the increased use of wireless communications and increased complexity trends occurring in these markets. PCTEL antennas are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) providers where they are designed into the customer’s solution. PCTEL maintains expertise in several technology areas in order to be competitive in the antenna market. These include radio frequency engineering, mobile antenna design and manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering. 



Generally, revenue growth for the RF Solutions segment is driven by the implementation and roll out of new wireless technology standards (i.e., 3G to 4G, 4G to 5G, etc.). PCTEL test equipment is sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEMs who integrate our products into their solution, which is then sold to wireless carriers. PCTEL maintains expertise in several technology areas in order to be competitive in the test tool market. These include radio frequency engineering, digital signal processing engineering, manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering. 





Results of Operations 



Three and six months Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 





Revenues by Segment 





Revenues increased 0.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and decreased 2.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. Revenues for the Connected Solutions segment increased 3.6% and 3.2% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017 due to increased sales in the Enterprise Wi-Fi vertical market. Revenues for the RF Solutions segment decreased 11.3% and 21.9% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017 primarily due to lower capital spending by U.S. carriers for legacy 4G wireless systems in preparation for the capital expenditures required for 5G deployments. RF Solution revenues were also lower in the Asia Pacific region because 2017 included some large projects in China and Japan.  



Gross Profit by Segment 





The gross profit decreased by 560 basis points for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and decreased by 520 basis points for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. The declines in gross profit were due to a higher mix of revenues from the Connected Solutions segment as well as a decline in the gross profit percentage for the Connected Solutions segment. The gross profit for the Connected Solutions segment declined by 520 basis points and 360 basis points for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, due to price pressure in the small cell vertical market and due to product mix. The gross profit for the RF Solutions segment decreased by 250 and 310 basis points for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017 primarily due to the impact of fixed costs over lower revenues. 





Consolidated Operating Expenses 





Research and Development 



Research and development expenses increased approximately $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and increased $0.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. The increase during the three months ended June 30, 2018 consists of higher expenses of $0.2 million for the Connected Solutions segment and higher expenses of $0.2 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase during the six months ended June 30, 2018 consists of higher expenses of $0.5 million for the Connected Solutions segment and higher expenses of $0.1 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in the prior year. Expenses for both segments were higher compared to the prior year periods due to additional headcount and equipment required to support investments in growth areas.  



Sales and Marketing 



Sales and marketing expenses include costs associated with the sales and marketing employees, sales agents, product line management, and trade show expenses.  



Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and decreased $0.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. For the three months ended June 30, 2018, sales and marketing expenses were higher by $0.2 million for the RF Solutions segment and approximately even for the Connected Solutions segment compared to the same period in 2017. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, sales and marketing expenses for the Connected Solutions segment declined $0.3 million, offsetting higher sales and marketing expenses of $0.2 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in 2017. The expense decrease for the Connected Solutions segment is due to headcount reductions in sales and marketing at the end of the first quarter 2017. The expense increase for RF Solutions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was due to additions to sales and marketing headcount. 



General and Administrative 



General and administrative expenses include costs associated with the general management, finance, human resources, IT, legal, public company costs, and other operating expenses to the extent not otherwise allocated to business segments. 



General and administrative expenses declined by $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and declined by $0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 because 2017 included incentive compensation expense and corporate expenses related to the CEO transition that were not included in 2018 and other corporate expenses were lower in 2018. Incentive compensation expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, were $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Corporate expenses related to the CEO transition were $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.  





Amortization of Intangible Assets 



Amortization expense within operating expenses was $0.1 million and $0.2 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Between the first quarter 2017 and the second quarter 2018, there were no changes to intangible assets that impacted amortization expense  



Stock-based compensation expense 







Stock compensation expense was approximately the same for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017.  



Operating (Loss) Income by Segment 





We reported a total operating loss of $1.6 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and an operating loss of $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The operating losses were primarily the result of lower profits for the RF Solutions segment and lower gross profits for the Connected Solutions segment. Due to lower revenues we recorded operating losses of $0.4 million and $0.7 million for RF Solutions segment during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to income for the same periods in 2017. Operating profit for the Connected Solutions segment was lower by approximately $0.8 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and lower by $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage. Within the corporate function, expenses were lower by $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 due to lower expenses related to the Short-Term Incentive Plan (“STIP”) and because the same periods in 2017 included expenses related to the CEO transition. 





Other Income, Net 





Other income, net consists of interest income, foreign exchange losses and gains, and interest expense. Interest income increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher average interest rates but also due to higher investment and cash equivalent balances. Our investment and cash equivalent balances declined during the six months ended June 30, 2018 but were higher compared to the first six months of 2017.  



Benefit for Income Taxes 





We recorded an income tax benefit of $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. The tax benefit recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2018 differed from the statutory rate of 21% by approximately 2%, because the Company did not record income tax benefits for losses with finite lives and due to permanent differences. The tax benefit recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2017 differed from the statutory rate of 34% by 66% due to the combination of U.S. pretax losses and foreign pretax profits taxed at lower rates. The net tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2017 included income tax expense of $0.1 million related to tax deficiencies with restricted stock and stock options and $0.1 million income tax benefit related to previously unrecognized tax benefits for research credits.  



We maintain valuation allowances due to uncertainties regarding realizability. Our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was $5.4 million and $5.2 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Most of our deferred tax assets relate to the United States tax jurisdiction. On a regular basis, we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance. Such evaluations involve the application of significant judgment. The valuation allowance at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 relates to net operating losses (“NOLs”) and credits. We believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized based on the negative evidence of a cumulative three-year loss through June 30, 2018 and at December 31, 2017 and the finite expiration of state NOLs and credits and federal NOLs generated as of December 31, 2017. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to income taxes.  



Net Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax Benefit 







During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we approved a plan to sell our Network Engineering Services business (“Engineering Services”) and shift our focus toward research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products. We sold the business to Gabe’s Construction on July 31, 2017. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to discontinued operations. The results for Engineering Services is reported as discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. The net loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 includes operating losses, net of income tax benefits. The loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 reflects negative gross margin of $0.1 million and $0.2 million due to the impact of high fixed costs over low revenues.  



Liquidity and Capital Resources 







Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview 



At June 30, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were approximately $36.5 million, and we had working capital of $55.6 million. Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations, with short-term swings in liquidity supported by a significant balance of cash and short-term investments. The balance has fluctuated with cash from operations, acquisitions and divestitures, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common shares. 



Within operating activities, we are historically a net generator of operating funds from our income statement activities. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our balance sheet provided operating funds. In periods of expansion, we expect to use cash from our balance sheet.  



Within investing activities, capital spending historically ranges between 2.0% and 4.0% of our revenues and the primary use of capital is for manufacturing and engineering development. Our capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2018 were approximately 3.5% of revenues. We historically have significant transfers between investments and cash as we rotate our large cash balances and short-term investment balances between money market funds, which are accounted for as cash equivalents, and other investment vehicles. We have a history of supplementing our organic revenue with acquisitions of product lines or companies, resulting in significant uses of our cash and short-term investment balances from time to time. We expect the historical trend for capital spending and the variability caused by moving money between cash and investments and periodic merger and acquisition activity to continue in the future. 



Within financing activities, we have historically generated funds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and have historically used funds to repurchase shares of our common stock through our share repurchase programs and through quarterly dividends. Whether this activity results in our being a net user of funds versus a net generator of funds is largely dependent on our stock price during any given year. 



Management believes that our current financial position, which includes the $36.5 million in cash and investments and no debt, combined with our historic ability to generate free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital spending) provide adequate liquidity and working capital to support our operations. 







Operating activities generated $2.0 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2018. We generated $1.4 million of cash from our income statement activities and generated $0.6 million of cash from our balance sheet activities. Within the balance sheet activities, we generated cash due to an increase in accounts payable of $2.7 million and net collections of accounts receivable of $0.5 million, offsetting use of cash for net payments of accrued liabilities of $2.1 million and higher inventories of $0.8 million. Accrued liabilities were lower at June 30, 2018, primarily due to the payout of $1.7 million for the 2017 short-term incentive plan. Accounts payable was higher at June 30, 2018 because we extended the payment cycle for certain vendors to match accounts receivable collections and due to the timing of purchases during the second quarter 2018. Inventories were higher for the Connected Solutions segment in both the U.S. and China.  



Operating activities from continuing operations provided $4.4 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2017. We generated $3.2 million of cash from our income statement activities and $1.2 million of cash from our balance sheet activities. From the balance sheet activities, we generated cash of $1.5 million from decreases in accounts receivable and $0.8 million from reductions in inventories and used cash of $0.7 million from reductions in accrued liabilities and $0.2 million from reductions in accounts payable. Inventories declined during the six months ended June 30, 2017 for both Connected Solutions and RF Solutions due to process improvements related to purchasing and forecasting, as well as a decrease in revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. Accounts receivable declined during the six months ended June 30, 2017 due to the decrease in revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. Revenues declined by $3.9 million during for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016. In total, accrued liabilities and accounts payable were lower by $0.9 million due to the reduction in amounts due for inventory purchases. 





Our investing activities provided $2.1 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2018. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, redemptions and maturities of our short-term investments provided $26.3 million in funds and we rotated $22.7 million of cash into new short-term investments. We used $1.5 million for capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2018. Capital expenditures included equipment for our new development office in Akron, Ohio. 



Our investing activities used $5.4 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2017. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, redemptions and maturities of our short-term investments provided $19.2 million in funds and we rotated $23.1 million of cash into new short-term investments. We used $1.5 million for capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2017. Capital expenditures included $0.6 million for a new IP phone and communications system.  





We used $2.0 million in cash for financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2018. We used $2.0 million for cash dividends paid in February 2018 and May 2018. We received $0.4 million in proceeds from the purchase of shares through our ESPP and we used $0.3 million for payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation and $0.1 million on payments for capital leases. The tax payments related to our stock issued for restricted stock awards. 



We used $1.6 million in cash for financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2017. We used $1.8 million for cash dividends paid in February and May 2017. We received $0.9 million in proceeds from the purchase of shares through our ESPP and stock option exercises. We used $0.7 million for payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation. The tax payments related to our stock issued for restricted stock awards. 



Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 



We had purchase obligations of $6.2 million and $5.7 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. These obligations are for the purchase of inventory, as well as for other goods and services in the ordinary course of business and exclude the balances for purchases currently recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet. 



As of June 30, 2018, we had operating lease obligations of approximately $2.8 million through 2025, primarily for facility leases. We had capital lease obligations of $0.3 million at June 30, 2018 and at December 31, 2017.  



We had a liability of $0.7 million related to income tax uncertainties at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. We do not know the timing of the settlement of this liability. 



U.S. Tariffs 





Effective July 6, 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (“USTR”) imposed duties of 25% on certain Chinese imports containing industrially significant technologies, including certain PCTEL antenna and antenna components. Tariffs have increased the cost of the Company’s products, adversely impacting the gross margin that the Company earns on sales of its products and making our products more expensive for customers. During the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2018, $7.5 million of our customer revenues were based on products subject to the new tariffs. In July, we initiated a 20% upcharge to end customers of these products to recover the impact of the additional costs for these U.S. tariffs. The Company will continue to monitor and adjust prices as necessary and as market conditions permit. However, the Company does not know the price elasticity of the unit volume based on the price increase.  



Additional tariffs affecting other antennas and antenna components become effective on August 23, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these additional tariffs. 



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 



We use certain critical accounting policies as described in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” of the 2017 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in any of our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2017. See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on recent accounting pronouncements and see Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to revenue recognition policies.
