Item 4. Controls and Procedures.



Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to HP’s management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.



Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during that quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 HP acquired the Apogee group, a U.K. based office equipment dealer, on November 1, 2018. During the second quarter of 2019, HP discovered that its newly acquired subsidiary had invoiced one payment and accepted two payments from Bank Sepah International plc shortly after the acquisition, under a legacy contract for copier services. Bank Sepah International plc is subject to U.S. sanctions pursuant to Executive Order 13382. The combined total value of the transactions was £72.49 ($92.78). We are unable to accurately calculate the net profit attributable to these transactions. Following HP’s discovery of these
