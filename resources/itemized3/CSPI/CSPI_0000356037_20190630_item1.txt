 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  



 FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018  



 Organization and Business  



 CSP Inc. ("CSPi" or "CSPI" or "the Company" or "we" or "our") was incorporated in 1968 and is based in Lowell, Massachusetts. CSPi and its subsidiaries develop and market IT integration solutions, advanced security products, managed IT services, purpose built network adapters, and high-performance cluster computer systems to meet the diverse requirements of its commercial and defense customers worldwide. The Company operates in two segments, its High Performance Products (“HPP”) segment and its Technology Solutions (“TS”) segment.  



 1. Basis of Presentation  



 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company, without audit, and reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of the interim periods presented. All adjustments were of a normal recurring nature. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, have been omitted.  



 Accordingly, the Company believes that although the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading, the unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the footnotes contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.  



 Unless otherwise noted, discussion within these notes to the consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on discontinued operations.  



 2. Use of Estimates  



 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are related to reserves for bad debt, reserves for inventory obsolescence, the impairment assessment of intangible assets, and the calculation of standalone selling price for revenue recognition, the calculation of liabilities related to deferred compensation and retirement plans and the calculation of income tax liabilities. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  







 We derive revenue from the sale of integrated hardware and software, third-party service contracts, professional services, managed services, financing of hardware and software, and other services.  



 We recognize revenue from hardware upon transfer of control, which is at a point in time typically upon shipment when title transfers. Revenue from software is recognized at a point in time when the license is granted.  



 We recognize revenue from third-party service contracts as either gross sales or net sales depending on whether the Company is acting as a principal party to the transaction or simply acting as an agent or broker based on control and

timing. The Company is a principal if it controls the good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer. We record revenue as gross when the Company is a principal party to the arrangement and net of cost when we are acting as a broker or agent. Under gross sales recognition, the entire selling price is recorded in revenue and our cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded in cost of goods sold. Under net sales recognition, the cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to revenue resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction. Third-party service contracts are sold in different combinations with hardware, software, and services. We have determined the third-party services contracts are a single performance obligation in each sale. When the Company is an agent, revenue is typically recorded at a point in time. When the Company is the principal, revenue is recognized over the contract term.  



 Professional services generally include implementation, installation, and training services. Professional services are considered a series of distinct services that form one performance obligation and revenue is recognized over time as services are performed.  



 Revenue generated from managed services is recognized over the term of the contract. Certain managed services contracts include financing of hardware and software. Revenues from arrangements which include financing are allocated considering relative standalone selling prices of lease and non-lease components within the agreement. The lease components include the hardware and software, which are subject to ASC 840. The non-lease component includes the managed services and is subject to ASC 606.  



 Other services generally include revenue generated through our royalty, extended warranty, multicomputer repair, and maintenance contracts. Royalty revenue is sales-based and recognized on date of subsequent sale of the product, which occurs on the date of customer shipment. Revenue from extended warranty contracts is recognized evenly over the period of the warranty. Multicomputer repair services revenue is recognized upon control transfer when the customer takes possession of the computer at time of shipping. Revenue generated from maintenance services is recognized evenly over the term of the contract.  



 Variable consideration is immaterial. Any products sold with right to return exists with the manufacturer. Managed service contracts contain the right to refund if canceled within 30 days of inception. Any products with a standard warranty are treated as a warranty obligation under ASC 460, Guarantees.  





 HPP Segment Revenue  



 HPP segment revenue is derived from the sale of integrated hardware and software, maintenance, and other services through the Multicomputer and Myricom product lines.  



 Myricom revenue is derived from the sale of products, which are comprised of both hardware and embedded software which is essential to the products functionality, and post contract maintenance and support. Post contract maintenance and support is considered immaterial in the context of the contract and therefore is not a separate performance obligation.  



 TS Segment Revenue  



 TS Segment revenue is derived from the sale of hardware, software, professional services, third-party service contracts, maintenance contracts, managed services, and financing of hardware and software. Financing revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. Financing revenue is recorded in revenue as equipment leasing and is part of the Company’s operations.  



 Third-party service contracts are evaluated to determine whether such service revenue should be recorded as gross sales or net and whether over time or at point in time.

 Significant Judgments  



 The input method using labor hours expended relative to the total expected hours is used to recognize revenue for professional services. Only the hours that depict the Company’s performance toward satisfying a performance obligation are used for progress. An estimate for professional services is made at the beginning of each contract based on prior experience and monitored throughout the services. This method is most appropriate as it depicts the measure of progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation.  



 When product and services are sold together, the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation is calculated using a budgeted cost-plus margin approach. Due to the complex nature of these contracts, there is significant judgment in allocating the transaction price. These estimates are periodically reviewed by project managers, engineers, and other staff involved to ensure estimates are appropriate. For items sold separately, including hardware, software, professional services, maintenance contracts, other services, and third-party service contracts, there is no allocation performed as there is one performance obligation.  



 Contract Assets and Liabilities  



 When the Company has performed work but does not have an unconditional right to payment, a contract asset is recorded. When the Company has the right to bill a customer, accounts receivable is recorded as an unconditional right exists. Current contract assets were $0.6 million and $1.1 million as of June 30, 2019 and October 1, 2018, respectively. The current portion is recorded in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. There were no non-current contract assets as of June 30, 2019 and October 1, 2018. The difference in the balances is due to regular timing differences between when work is performed and having an unconditional right to payment.  





 Table of Contents  



 Contract liabilities arise when payment is received before the Company transfers a good or service to the customer. Current contract liabilities were $0.8 million and $0.9 million as of June 30, 2019 and October 1, 2018, respectively. The current portion of contract liabilities is recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. There were no non-current contract liabilities as of June 30, 2019 and October 1, 2018. Revenue recognized for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 that was included in contract liabilities as of the beginning of the period was $0.7 million.  



 Contract Costs  



 Incremental costs of obtaining a contract involving customer transactions where the revenue and the related transfer of goods and services are less than a one-year period, are expensed as incurred, utilizing the practical expedient in ASC 340‑40‑25‑4. For a period greater than one year, incremental contract costs are capitalized if the Company expects to recover these costs. These costs are only capitalized if the contract is obtained. The costs are amortized over the contract term and expected renewal periods. The period of amortization is generally three to six years. Incremental costs are related to commissions in the TS portion of the business. Current capitalized contract costs are within the account other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets for the periods ended June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018. The portion of current capitalized costs was $54 thousand and $71 thousand as of June 30, 2019 and October 1, 2018, respectively. There are no non-current capitalized costs on the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of incremental costs amortized for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and nine months ended June 30, 2019 was $66 thousand and $174 thousand, respectively, which is recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses. There was no impairment related to incremental costs capitalized during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019.  



 Costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized when the costs are related to a contract or anticipated contract, generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future, and costs are recoverable. Costs to fulfill a contract are related to the TS portion of the business and involve activities performed before managed services can be completed. Current capitalized fulfillment costs are in the account other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The portion of current capitalized costs was $48 thousand and $60 thousand as of June 30, 2019 and October 1, 2018, respectively. There are no non-current capitalized fulfillment costs on the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of fulfillment costs amortized for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 was $1 thousand and $9 thousand, respectively, which is recorded in cost of sales. There was no impairment related to fulfillment costs capitalized.  



 Other  



 Projects are typically billed upon completion or at certain milestones. Product and services are typically billed when shipped or as services are being performed. Payment terms are typically 30 days to pay in full except in Europe where it could be up to 90 days. Most of the Company’s contracts are less than one year. As a practical expedient, the Company has elected not to adjust the amount of consideration for effects of a significant financing component when it is anticipated the promised good or service will be transferred and the subsequent payment will be one year or less. The Company elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that have an original expected duration of one year or less. This is due to a low amount of performance obligations less than one year being unsatisfied at each period end. Most of these contracts are related to product sales.

 4. Earnings Per Share of Common Stock  



 Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share reflects the maximum dilution that would have resulted from the assumed exercise and share repurchase related to dilutive stock options and is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the assumed weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  



 We are required to present earnings per share, or EPS, utilizing the two class method because we had outstanding, non-vested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, which are considered participating securities.  







 Non-vested restricted stock awards of 176,000 shares were excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, as there was a net loss and their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. Non-vested restricted stock awards of 168,000 shares were excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, as there was a net loss and their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

 Finished goods includes inventory that has been shipped, but for which all revenue recognition criteria has not been met, of approximately $0.8 million and $0.7 million as of June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively.  



 Total inventory balances in the table above are shown net of reserves for obsolescence of approximately $3.7 million and $3.3 million as of June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively.  



 6. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss  









 The income tax benefit was $326 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to an income tax expense of $249 thousand in the same period of 2018. The income tax benefit for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 was $466 thousand and tax expense for the same period of the prior year was $1.2 million primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The U.K. did not have any income tax expense in the three or nine-month periods of fiscal year 2019 due to benefits from the pension contribution and utilization of a small portion of its net tax operating loss.  



 The provisions above are estimates, and accordingly, changes to these estimates will be recorded in subsequent periods as more information and guidance becomes available.  



 8. Pension and Retirement Plans  



 The Company’s continuing operations has defined benefit and defined contribution plans in the U.K. and in the U.S. The Company’s discontinued operations had a defined benefit and defined contribution plan in Germany, which was assumed by Reply AG in its acquisition of the Company’s operations in Germany (see Note 12 below). In the U.K., the Company provides defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for some of its employees. In the U.S., the Company provides benefits through supplemental retirement plans to certain former employees. The U.S. supplemental retirement plans have life insurance policies which are not plan assets but were purchased by the Company as a vehicle to fund the costs of the plan. The Company also provides for officer death benefits through post-retirement plans to certain officers of the Company in the U.S. All of the Company’s defined benefit plans are closed to newly hired employees and have been since September 2009.  





 Table of Contents  



 The Company funds its pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws and local tax laws. Liabilities for amounts in excess of these funding levels are accrued and reported in the consolidated balance sheets.  



 The Company’s pension plan in the U.K. is the only plan with plan assets. The plan assets consist of an investment in a commingled fund which in turn comprises a diversified mix of assets including corporate equity securities, government securities and corporate debt securities.

 11. Recent Accounting Pronouncements  



 Accounting standards recently adopted  



 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014‑09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The standard outlines a five-step model whereby revenue is recognized as performance obligations within a contract are satisfied. The standard also requires new, expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition. The ASU replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. The new standard was adopted by the Company effective October 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach only to contracts that were not completed as of adoption date. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initial application as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. This resulted in an increase of $158 thousand to retained earnings as of October 1, 2018. This was primarily due to revenue related to customer support in the HPP segment no longer being deferred, which resulted in a decrease of deferred revenue as part of the cumulative effect. Additionally, revenue from software sales is no longer being deferred under ASC 606 as recognition is now when control transfers to the customer. There were no previous period financial statement adjustments.  









 Table of Contents  







 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016‑15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This ASU will reduce diversity in practice for classifying cash payments and receipts in the statement of cash flows for a number of common transactions. It will also clarify when identifiable cash flows should be separated versus classified based on their predominant source or use. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Beginning October 1, 2018, the Company adopted the ASU and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  



 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016‑16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This ASU requires the seller and buyer to recognize at the transaction date the current and deferred income tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers (except transfers of inventory). Under current GAAP, the seller and buyer defer the consolidated tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer from the period of the transfer to a future period when the asset is transferred out of the consolidated group, or otherwise affects consolidated earnings. This standard will cause volatility in companies’ effective tax rates, particularly for those that transfer intangible assets to foreign subsidiaries. For public entities, the new standard is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Beginning October 1, 2018, the Company adopted the ASU and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  



 In January 2017, FASB issued ASU No. 2017‑01, Business Combinations Clarifying the Definition of a Business (Topic 805) (“ASU No. 2017‑01”). ASU 2017‑01 provides a framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business. ASU 2017‑01 provides more consistency in applying the business combination guidance, reduces the costs of application, and makes the definition of a business more operable. ASU 2017‑01 is effective for interim and 





 Table of Contents  



annual periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Beginning October 1, 2018, the Company adopted the ASU and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  





 New accounting standards not adopted as of June 30, 2019  



 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016‑02, Leases (Topic 842), an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This ASU requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for most lease arrangements. The new standard is effective for the Company on October 1, 2019. The standard mandates a modified retrospective transition method for all entities and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016‑02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  





 In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018‑07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Under this ASU companies will no longer be required to value non-employee awards differently from employee awards, but the accounting remains different for attribution and a contractual term election for valuing nonemployee equity share options. Equity-classified awards to nonemployees will now be measured at the grant date using fair value of the equity instruments the company is obligated to issue and recognition is associated with the probable outcome. Awards are subsequently measured using stock compensation guidance unless they are modified after the nonemployee stops providing goods or services. Existing disclosure requirements within the stock compensation guidance also apply to nonemployee awards. For public entities, the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2018‑07 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  



 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018‑14, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715‑20), Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Under this ASU existing disclosures not considered cost beneficial are removed, disclosures identified as relevant are added, and there is added clarification regarding specific existing disclosures. For public entities, the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2018‑14 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

 12. Discontinued Operations of TS Segment  



 On July 31, 2018, CSPi LTD, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, completed its sale of all of the outstanding stock of Modcomp GmbH, to Reply AG, an affiliate of Reply SpA, a holding company for a worldwide group of companies, pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase and Assignment Agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) dated June 27, 2018. Modcomp GmbH, dba CSPI GmbH, through itself and its wholly owned subsidiaries, provided managed security services to customers primarily in Germany.  



 Upon the closing of the Share Purchase Agreement, Reply AG paid to CSPI total cash at closing of approximately $14.4 million, which consisted of the original purchase price of $11.7 million plus an adjustment at closing for Net Cash (as defined in the Share Purchase Agreement) of approximately $2.7 million. An additional €400 thousand is included in escrow and will be recorded if and when received by the Company. Accordingly, CSPi determined that the assets and liabilities of this reportable segment met the discontinued operations criteria in U.S. GAAP in the year ended September 30, 2018. The gain recorded due to the sale of all the stock of Modcomp GmbH was approximately $16.8 million. No income taxes were provided as the transaction was a tax-free exchange in the U.K. As such, Modcomp GmbH’s results have been recorded as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.
