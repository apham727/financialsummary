Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 



Repurchases of the Company’s common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In August 2019, the Company announced the adoption of a $2.0 million stock repurchase program running through the end of 2020. Under the stock repurchase program, repurchases can be made from time to time using a variety of methods, including through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable legal requirements. This new $2.0 million repurchase program replaces a stock repurchase program that the Company had adopted in 2008. The 2008 stock repurchase program had authorized the repurchase of up to 411,910 additional shares, but had no specific dollar amount associated with it. The Company had not made any market repurchases under the 2008 stock repurchase program in the past several years.
