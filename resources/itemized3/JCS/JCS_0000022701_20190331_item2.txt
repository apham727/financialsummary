Transition Networks Results 













Sales in North America decreased $731,000, or 10%, primarily due to timing of orders from the federal government and a large carrier customer. International sales increased $468,000, or 31%, primarily due to a significant project with a customer in our EMEA region for media converter products, partially offset by weakness in our ROW region.

All other product sales decreased 12% or $197,000 due to slower activity in our ancillary products business.

Suttle Results 



Suttle sales decreased 21% in the first quarter of 2019 to $5,521,000 compared to $6,973,000 in the same period of 2018 due to reduced spend from Tier 1 telecommunications providers, volume declines in legacy products, and a shift in purchasing decisions from Tier 1 telecommunications suppliers to installers.

Revenues from the education sector increased $1,364,000 or 1251% in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the 2018 first quarter due to the resumption of scheduled education projects funded by the federal government that were delayed in the prior year.

Income Taxes 



The Company’s income before income taxes was $215,000 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a loss before income taxes of $1,852,000 in the first quarter of 2018. The Company’s effective income tax rate was (11.6%) in the first quarter of 2019 and (0.4%) in 2018. This effective tax rate for 2019 differs from the federal tax rate of 21% due to state income taxes, foreign tax rate differences, foreign losses not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, the effect of uncertain income tax positions, stock compensation shortfalls, provision true-ups and changes in valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets. 



Liquidity and Capital Resources 



As of March 31, 2019, the Company had $9,491,000 in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Of this amount, $6,974,000 was invested in short-term money market funds that are not considered to be bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or other government agency. These money market funds seek to preserve the value of the investment at $1.00 per share; however, it is possible to lose money investing in these funds. The remainder in cash and cash equivalents is operating cash. 



The Company had working capital of $31,233,000 at March 31, 2019, consisting of current assets of approximately $40,934,000 and current liabilities of $9,701,000 compared to working capital of $30,695,000 at December 31, 2018 consisting of current assets of $42,335,000 and current liabilities of $11,640,000.

Net cash used in investing activities was $217,000 in the first three months of 2019 compared to $719,000 provided in 2018, due to capital expenditures. 





Net cash used in financing activities was $159,000 in the first three months of 2019 compared to $389,000 used in financing activities in 2018. Cash dividends paid on common stock decreased to $184,000 in 2019 ($0.02 per common share) from $391,000 in 2018 ($0.04 per common share). Proceeds from common stock issuances, principally shares sold to the Company’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan and issued under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, totaled approximately $27,000 in 2019 and $30,000 in 2018. The Company did not repurchase any shares in 2019 or 2018 under the Board-authorized program. At March 31, 2019, Board of Director authority to purchase approximately 411,910 additional shares remained in effect. The Company acquired $2,000 and $28,000 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, of Company stock from employees to satisfy withholding tax obligations related to share-based compensation, pursuant to terms of Board and shareholder-approved compensation plans. 



The Company has a $15,000,000 line of credit from Wells Fargo Bank. Interest on borrowings on the credit line is at LIBOR plus 2.0% (4.5% at March 31, 2019). The Company had no outstanding borrowings against the line of credit at March 31, 2019. The credit agreement expires August 12, 2021 and is secured by assets of the Company. 



In the opinion of management, based on the Company’s current financial and operating position and projected future expenditures, sufficient funds are available to meet the Company’s anticipated operating and capital expenditure needs. 



Critical Accounting Policies 



Our critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgments underlying them, are discussed in our 2018 Form 10-K in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842), which amends existing guidance and requires an entity to recognize both assets and liabilities arising from financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the accounting standard effective January 1, 2019. Please see Note 3 for the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this standard. There were no other significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2019. 



The Company’s accounting policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and disclose matters such as allowance for doubtful accounts, sales returns, inventory valuation, warranty expense, income taxes, revenue recognition, asset impairment recognition and foreign currency translation. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. Management reviews these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.
