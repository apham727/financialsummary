NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  



1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION  



Pegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.) for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  



In the opinion of management, the Company has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on the same basis as its audited financial statements, and these financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented.  



The operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year 2018.  



On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) using the full retrospective method which required that each prior reporting period presented be adjusted to reflect the application of this ASU. See Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements for additional information.  



2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  



Financial instruments  



In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of other-than-temporary impairments. The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  



Leases  



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets, recognizing a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects that most of its operating lease commitments will be subject to this ASU and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption with a material impact to the Companys balance sheet but an immaterial impact to its results of operations and cash flows. The Company expects to elect the optional transition method to apply the new lease standard prospectively at the adoption date, as opposed to recasting prior reporting periods. As a result, the Company expects to recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption.  



ASC 606 and ASC 340-40  



On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the ASC 606 revenue recognition standard and has adjusted prior periods to conform.  





       



Perpetual licenses with extended payment terms and term licenses - Revenue from perpetual licenses with extended payment terms and term licenses is now recognized when control is transferred to the client, which is defined as the point in time when the client can use and benefit from the license. Previously, the Company recognized revenue over the term of the agreements as payments became due or earlier if prepaid. Any unrecognized license revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period that control transfers or as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of December 31, 2015. Unbilled receivables in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets increased significantly upon adoption due to the revenue from term licenses being recognized prior to amounts being due, or prepaid, by clients and perpetual licenses with extended payment terms.  



       



Allocation of future credits and significant discounts - Perpetual or term licenses delivered are a separate performance obligation which now requires the Company to allocate any future credits and discounts to the performance obligations in the arrangement based upon their relative stand-alone selling prices.

PEGASYSTEMS INC.  



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  



       



Deferred contract costs - Sales incentive programs and other incremental costs to obtain a contract were previously expensed when incurred. ASC 340-40 requires these costs be recognized as an asset when incurred and expensed over the period of expected benefit, which is on average five years. This change primarily impacts the Companys contracts related to multi-year cloud offerings, maintenance on term and perpetual licenses, and long-term term and perpetual licenses with client usage rights that increase over time.  



       



Taxes - The corresponding effect on tax balances of the above impacts has also been recognized.  



For additional information on the Companys accounting policies as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 see Note 4. Receivables, Contract Assets, and Deferred Revenue, Note 5. Deferred Contract Costs, and Note 9. Revenue.  









Includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, income taxes receivable, other current assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-term assets (as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017).

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  





Adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 did not change the Companys total cash provided by or used in operating, financing, or investing activities in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.  









As of September 30, 2018, the Company did not hold any investments with unrealized losses that are considered to be other-than-temporary.  





Table of Contents 



PEGASYSTEMS INC.  



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  



As of September 30, 2018, remaining maturities of marketable securities ranged from October 2018 to August 2021, with a weighted-average remaining maturity of approximately 1.5 years.  



4. RECEIVABLES, CONTRACT ASSETS, AND DEFERRED REVENUE  



Receivables  





Unbilled receivables are the amounts due from clients where the only condition to the right of payment is the passage of time. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the allowance for doubtful accounts was not material.  







Contract assets and deferred revenue  





 (1) Included in other current assets.  



 (2) Included in other long-term assets.  



 (3) Included in other long-term liabilities.  



Contract assets are amounts under client contracts where revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation. Deferred revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition. Contract assets and deferred revenue are netted at the contract level for each reporting period.  



The change in deferred revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to $225.1 million of revenue recognized, excluding the impact of netting contract assets and deferred revenue at the contract level, during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2017, partially offset by new billings in advance of revenue recognition.  



Major clients  



No client represented 10% or more of the Companys total receivables as of September 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017.  



5. DEFERRED CONTRACT COSTS  



The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a client if the Company expects the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. Deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the benefit period, which is on average five years.  





 (1) Included in other long-term assets.

8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  



Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  



The Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and investments in privately-held companies at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  





       



Level 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  



       



Level 2 - significant other inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; and  



       



Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs on which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.  



The Companys cash equivalents are composed of money market funds and time deposits, which are classified within Level 1 and Level 2, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy. The Companys marketable securities, which are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on a market approach using quoted prices, when available, or matrix pricing compiled by third party pricing vendors, using observable market inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, and credit risk. The Companys investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are valued using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.  



If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs. There were no transfers between levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.  







 (1) Included in other long-term assets.  





Table of Contents 



PEGASYSTEMS INC.  



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  





 (1) Included in other long-term assets.  



For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying value approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these items.  



Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  



Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including property and equipment and intangible assets, are recognized at fair value when they are impaired. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not recognize any impairments of its assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  





Revenue policy  





       



Software license revenue is primarily derived from sales of the Companys Pega Platform and software applications.  



       



Maintenance revenue includes revenue from client support including software upgrades on a when and-if available basis, telephone support, and bug fixes or patches.  



       



Services revenue is primarily derived from cloud revenue, which is sales of the Companys hosted Pega Platform and software applications, and consulting revenue, which is primarily related to new license implementations.  



Contracts with multiple performance obligations  



The Companys license and cloud arrangements often contain multiple performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. If the transaction price contains discounts or the Company expects to provide a future price concession, these elements are considered when determining the transaction price prior to allocation. Variable fees within the transaction price are estimated and recognized in revenue as the Company satisfies each performance obligation to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable fee is resolved. If the contract grants the client the option to acquire additional products or services, the Company assesses whether any discount on the included products and services is in excess of levels normally available to similar clients and, if so, accounts for that discount as an additional performance obligation.  



Software licenses  



The Company has concluded that its software licenses are distinct performance obligations, as the client can benefit from the software on its own. Software license revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the client, which is defined as the point in time when the client can use and benefit from the license. The software license is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without services, updates, and technical support.  



Stand-alone selling price for software licenses is determined using the residual approach. The Company utilizes the residual approach as license performance obligations are sold for a broad range of amounts (the selling price is highly variable) and a stand-alone selling price is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. Periodically, the Company reevaluates whether the residual approach is appropriate for its license performance obligations when sold with other performance obligations. If the standalone selling price analysis illustrates that software license performance obligations are no longer highly variable, the Company will utilize the relative allocation method for such arrangements.  





Table of Contents 



PEGASYSTEMS INC.  



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  



Term license fees are usually payable in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the license agreement, which is typically three to five years and may be renewed for additional terms at the clients option. Perpetual license fees are usually payable when the contract is executed.  



Maintenance  



Maintenance contracts entitle clients to receive technical support and software updates, on a when and if available basis, during the term of the maintenance contract. Technical support and software updates are considered distinct services but accounted for as a single performance obligation, as they each constitute a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the client. Maintenance revenue is recognized over time on a straight-line basis over the contract period.  



The maintenance performance obligation is priced as a percentage of the selling price of the related software license, which is highly variable. The Company determined the standalone selling price based on this pricing relationship, which has remained constant within a narrow range, and observable data from standalone sales of maintenance, along with all other observable data.  



Maintenance fees are usually payable in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the agreement.  



Services  



Services revenue is comprised of consulting, including software license implementations, training, reimbursable expenses, and cloud, which is derived from sales of the Companys hosted Pega Platform and software application environments. The Company has concluded that most services are distinct performance obligations. Consulting may be provided on a stand-alone basis or bundled with other performance obligations.  



       



The stand-alone selling price for time and materials consulting is determined by observable prices in similar transactions without multiple performance obligations and recognized as revenue as the services are performed. Fees for time and materials consulting contracts are usually payable shortly after the service is provided.  



       



The stand-alone selling price for fixed price consulting is based on the estimated hours versus actual hours in similar geographies and for similar contract sizes. Revenue for fixed price consulting is recognized over time as the services are provided. Fees for fixed price consulting are usually payable as contract milestones are achieved.  



       



The stand-alone selling price of cloud sales of production environments is determined based on the residual approach when sold with other performance obligations and is recognized over the term of the service. The Company utilizes the residual approach as cloud performance obligations are sold for a broad range of amounts (the selling price is highly variable) and a stand-alone selling price is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. Cloud fees for production environments are usually payable in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the service.  



       



The stand-alone selling price for cloud sales of development and testing environments is developed using observable prices in similar transactions without multiple performance obligations and is recognized over the term of the service. Cloud fees for development and testing environments are usually payable in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the service.  



Contract modifications  







if the additional products and services are distinct from the products and services in the original arrangement, and  





if the amount of consideration expected for the added products and services reflects the stand-alone selling price of those products and services.  







a prospective basis as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract; or  





a cumulative catch-up basis.

Expense  





The Company recognizes stock-based compensation using the accelerated recognition method, treating each vesting tranche as if it were an individual grant. As of September 30, 2018, the Company had, net of estimated forfeitures, $74.2 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, related to all unvested restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options, which was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.  



Grants  









Includes approximately 0.1 million RSUs which were granted in connection with the election by certain employees to receive 50% of their 2018 target incentive compensation under the Companys Corporate Incentive Compensation Plan in the form of RSUs instead of cash. Stock-based compensation of approximately $8.2 million associated with this RSU grant is expected to be recognized over a one-year period beginning on the grant date.  



RSU vestings and stock option exercises  



During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, 1.2 million shares of common stock were issued due to stock option exercises and RSU vestings under the Companys stock-based compensation plans.  





Effective income tax rate  







Table of Contents 



PEGASYSTEMS INC.  



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  





       



excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were disproportionately greater than the (loss) income before benefit from income taxes;  



       



a decrease in the estimated annual effective income tax rate primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. statutory federal tax rate from 35% to 21% pursuant to the Tax Reform Act;  



       



an increase in utilization of U.S. research and development tax credits; and  



       



a decrease in uncertain tax provisions as a result of the settlement of a foreign tax audit for 2012 through 2015.  



Tax reform act  



On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act) was enacted into law, which significantly changed U.S. tax law and included many provisions, such as a reduction of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign earnings, and a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of foreign subsidiaries, a special tax deduction for foreign derived intangible income, and a base erosion anti-abuse tax measure (BEAT) that may tax payments between a U.S. corporation and its foreign subsidiaries, among other tax changes.  



In the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized, under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), provisional income taxes, including $20.4 million of income tax expense to re-measure its net deferred tax assets to the 21% enacted rate. Also, during the same period, the Company reduced its provisional income taxes by a $12.6 million income tax benefit as a result of the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities under the retrospective adoption of ASC 606.  



The final income tax amounts may differ from those provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions by the Company, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Reform Act.  



The Tax Reform Act also provided for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through December 31, 2017. However, based on the Companys provisional analysis performed as of that date, the Company does not expect to be subject to the one-time transition tax due to the Companys foreign subsidiaries being in a net accumulated deficit position. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recognized no material adjustments to these estimates.  





       



The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax base foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiarys tangible assets. The Company expects that it will be subject to incremental U.S. tax resulting from GILTI inclusions beginning in 2018. As of September 30, 2018, the Company has included an estimate of the effect of its GILTI provisions in its estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company continues to monitor IRS guidance and will update its estimates as guidance is issued.  



       



The BEAT provisions in the Tax Reform Act impose an alternative minimum tax on taxpayers with substantial base-erosion payments. The Companys preliminary assessment is that the Company will not be subject to the BEAT in 2018. The Company continues to monitor IRS guidance and will update its estimates as guidance is issued.  



12. EARNINGS PER SHARE  



Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and RSUs, using the treasury stock method. In periods of loss, all stock options and RSUs are excluded, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.  





Table of Contents 



PEGASYSTEMS INC.  



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  









Certain outstanding stock options and RSUs were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive in the period presented. These awards may be dilutive in the future.
