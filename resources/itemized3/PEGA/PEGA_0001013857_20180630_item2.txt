BUSINESS OVERVIEW  



We develop, market, license, and support software applications for customer engagement and digital process automation, in addition to licensing our Pega Platform application development product for clients that wish to build and extend their own applications. The Pega Platform and applications help connect enterprises to their customers in real-time across channels, streamline business operations, and adapt to meet changing requirements.  



Our clients include Global 3000 companies and government agencies that seek to manage complex enterprise systems and customer service issues with greater agility and cost-effectiveness. Our strategy is to sell a client a series of licenses, each focused on a specific purpose or area of operations in support of longer term enterprise-wide digital transformation initiatives.  



Our license revenue is primarily derived from sales of our applications and Pega Platform. Our cloud revenue is derived from our hosted software applications and Pega Platform environments. Our consulting revenue is primarily related to new license implementations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICES  



Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) and the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and expectations of what could occur in the future given available information.  





       



Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Judgments in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data both of which are contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Revenue  



We account for revenue in accordance with ASC 606. Our revenue recognition policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates.  



Our clients contracts with us typically contain promises by us to provide multiple products and services. Judgment is required to determine whether each product and service is considered to be a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately under the contract. We allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations based on relative stand-alone selling price. We estimate stand-alone selling price based on the prices charged to clients, or by using information such as market conditions and other observable inputs. However, the selling price of our software licenses and cloud performance obligations are highly variable. Thus, we estimate stand-alone selling price for software licenses and cloud performance obligations using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price minus the stand-alone selling price of other performance obligations promised in the contract.  



In applying our revenue recognition policy, we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred and recognized in future periods. We analyze various factors including, but not limited to, the selling price of undelivered services when sold on a stand-alone basis, our pricing policies, and contractual terms and conditions to help us make such judgments about revenue recognition. Changes in judgment on any of these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a given period.  



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  





Revenue  



License and Cloud Revenue  







Table of Contents 



We continue to experience a shift in client preferences from perpetual arrangements to term and cloud arrangements. Revenue for cloud arrangements is recognized over the service period of the cloud contract, as compared to license arrangements, which is generally recognized at the contract effective date.  



The decrease in term license revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to $35.3 million in revenue recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2017 from a large term license renewal.  



Maintenance  





The increases in maintenance revenue were primarily due to the continued growth in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software and strong renewal rates significantly in excess of 90%.  



Consulting and training  





Our consulting and training revenue may fluctuate in future periods depending on the mix of new implementation projects we perform as compared to those performed by our enabled clients or led by our partners.  



The increases in consulting and training revenue were primarily due to higher billable hours driven by an increase in the number of projects during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.  



Gross profit  





The increase in total gross profit in the three months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to a large term license recognized in revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2018.  



Maintenance and cloud gross profit percent  



The increases in maintenance gross profit percent in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were driven by decreases of $0.7 million and $1 million, respectively, in compensation and benefits due to decreased headcount and a decrease in client support expenses as we transferred resources to provide dedicated support to our growing cloud business.  



The increases in cloud gross profit percent in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were driven by cost efficiency gains as our cloud business continues to grow and scale, partially offset by an increase in client support expenses as we expanded our cloud client support function to sustain our growing cloud business.  



Consulting and training gross profit percent  



The decreases in consulting and training gross profit percent in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were driven primarily by lower utilization rates and the impact of our policy introduced late in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to offer our web-based training free of charge to users which reduced training revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 by $0.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively.  





Table of Contents 



Operating expenses  



Selling and marketing  





Selling and marketing expenses include compensation, benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with our selling and marketing personnel as well as advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Selling and marketing expenses also include the amortization of client-related intangibles. The increase in headcount reflects our efforts to increase our sales capacity to target new accounts in existing industries, as well as to expand coverage in new industries and geographies, and to increase the number of sales opportunities.  



The increases in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of $13.7 million and $25.4 million, increased employee travel and entertainment, and increased expenses related to the realignment of contract negotiation resources.  



Research and development  





Research and development expenses include compensation, benefits, contracted services, and other headcount-related expenses associated with the creation and development of our products, as well as enhancements and design changes to existing products and the integration of acquired technologies.  



The increases in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of $1 million and $5.5 million, respectively, attributable to increased headcount and the expansion of our application development team to support the continued development of our expanding suite of software.  



General and administrative  





General and administrative expenses include compensation, benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, corporate governance, and other administrative headcount. They also include accounting, legal, and other professional consulting and administrative fees. The general and administrative headcount includes employees in human resources, information technology, and corporate services departments, whose costs are partially allocated to other operating expense areas.  



The decrease in the three months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits of $1.6 million, due to decreased headcount reflecting the realignment of contract negotiation and product development resources to augment our selling and marketing and research development functions, respectively.  



The increase in the six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to an increase of $1.2 million in legal fees.  





Table of Contents 



Stock-based compensation  





The increase in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to the increased value of our annual periodic equity awards granted in March 2018 and 2017. These awards generally have a five-year vesting schedule.  

















       



excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 of $11.4 million and $18.1 million were disproportionately greater relative to income before benefit from income taxes;  



       



a decrease in the estimated annual effective income tax rate primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. statutory federal tax rate from 35% to 21% pursuant to the Tax Reform Act;  



       



an increase in U.S. research and development tax credits; and  



       



a decrease in the balance of our uncertain tax positions as a result of the settlement of a foreign tax audit for 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.  



The inclusion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation in the provision for income taxes has increased the fluctuation of the effective tax rates in recent periods. This fluctuation may continue in future periods, as the amount of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation awards varies depending on our future stock price in relation to the fair value of awards, the timing of RSU vestings, exercise behavior of our stock option holders, and the total value of future grants of stock-based compensation awards.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  





We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations, quarterly cash dividends, and stock repurchases for at least the next 12 months.  



If it became necessary to repatriate foreign funds, we may be required to pay U.S. state and local taxes, as well as foreign taxes, upon repatriation. Due to the complexity of the income tax laws and the effects of the Tax Reform Act, it is impracticable to estimate the amount of taxes we would have to pay.  



Cash provided by operating activities  



The primary drivers during the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $71.8 million in cash generated from receivables and contract assets, largely due to increased cash collections and the timing of billings.  



The primary driver during the six months ended June 30, 2017 was net income of $56.7 million.  



Cash used in investing activities  



Cash used in investing activities is primarily driven by the timing of investment maturities and purchases of new investments.  



Cash used in financing activities  



We used cash primarily for repurchases of our common stock under our publicly announced stock repurchase programs, stock repurchases for tax withholdings for the net settlement of our equity awards, and the payment of our quarterly dividend.  



Stock Repurchase Program  



Since 2004, our Board of Directors has approved annual stock repurchase programs with the aggregate authority to repurchase up to $221.8 million of our common stock. Purchases under these programs have been made on the open market. As of June 30, 2018, $169.4 million had been repurchased, $46 million remained available for repurchase, and $6.4 million had expired.  



Common stock repurchases  







Represents activity under our publicly announced stock repurchase programs.  





During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, instead of receiving cash from the equity holders, we withheld shares with a value of $21.1 million and $20.7 million for the exercise price of options. These amounts have been excluded from the table above.  





Table of Contents 



Dividends  



During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we paid cash dividends of $4.7 million and $4.6 million. It is our current intention to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share, however, the Board of Directors may terminate or modify this dividend program at any time without prior notice.
