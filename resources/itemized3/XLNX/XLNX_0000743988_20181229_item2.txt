Item 2.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations



The statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis that are forward-looking, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve numerous risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including those risks discussed under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this document. Often, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "continue," "plan," "intend," "project" and other similar terminology, or the negative of such terms. We disclaim any responsibility to update or revise any forward-looking statement provided in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for any reason.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates





Due to the acquisition of Deephi Tech, we included business combinations in our critical accounting policies. We use the acquisition method of accounting and allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquiree based on their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets required and liabilities acquired, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth and margins, future changes in technology, expected cost and time to develop in-process research and development, brand awareness and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. 



We also have other key accounting policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could significantly affect our financial reporting.









Net Revenues





•Advanced Products include our most recent product offerings and consist of the Alveo branded boards, UltraScale+, UltraScale and 7-series product families.



•Core Products consist of all other product families.



These product categories are modified on a periodic basis to better reflect the maturity of the products and advances in technology. The most recent modification was made on April 3, 2016, which was the beginning of our fiscal 2017, whereby we reclassified our product categories to be consistent with how these categories are analyzed and reviewed internally. 



No end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019.



Net Revenues by Product







Net revenues from Advanced Products increased in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the comparable prior year periods. The increases were a result of sales growth from all product families, with the most significant growth coming from our 16nm and 20nm product families. We expect sales of Advanced Products to continue to grow as more customer programs enter volume production with both our 16nm and our new Alveo branded board products. 



Net revenues from Core Products also increased in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were largely due to higher sales from our Spartan 6 and Virtex 2 product families, which more 



than offset the sales decreases from Virtex 6 and Spartan 3 product families. Core Products are relatively mature products and, as a result, their sales are expected to decline over time.



Net Revenues by End Markets











Net revenues from Data Center and TME increased, in terms of absolute dollar, in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to higher sales from Data Center, which more than offset the decreases in sales from TME. 



Net revenues from Automotive, Broadcast and Consumer increased, in terms of absolute dollar, in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were due to higher sales from all sub-segments, with particular strength coming from Automotive and Audio, Video and Broadcast.



Net revenues from Communications increased, in terms of absolute dollar, in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to higher sales from all sub-segments, with particular strength coming from Wireless business driven by both the continued deployment of 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks and the ramping up global deployment of 5G wireless networks.





Channel revenue was a positive amount in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019, because shipments to distributors exceeded what the distributors subsequently shipped to their customers during such periods. In the second half of fiscal 2018, we partnered with our distributors to reduce overall distributor inventory and improve the stability of inventory balances. Beginning in fiscal 2019, our distributors restocked their inventory to support mutual growth and customer service objectives. We expect channel revenue to be a small portion of overall revenue over time as stocking levels have increased and are approximating previous levels.



Net Revenues by Geography







Net revenues in North America increased in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to higher sales from Wireline and Data Center, which more than offset the decline in revenue from TME and Aerospace and Defense in both periods. 



Net revenues in Asia Pacific increased in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were due to a broad-based increase in sales from most of our end markets, in particular the Wireless business driven by the continued deployment of 4G LTE networks and the ramping up deployment of 5G wireless networks, and to a lesser extent from Data Center. 



Net revenues in Europe increased in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to higher sales from TME and Automotive. 



Net revenues in Japan increased in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. Revenue from TME, Consumer and Data Center increased for both periods, but the increases were partially offset by lower sales from Wireless. 



Gross Margin 





Gross margin was lower by 1.3 and 0.5 percentage points in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods, respectively. The decreases were driven primarily by changes in the end-market mix, as revenue from Wireless, which has a relatively lower margin, increased more significantly as compared to the increases in the other end-markets. 



Gross margin may be affected in the future due to multiple factors, including but not limited to those set forth in Item 1A. "Risk Factors," included in Part II of this Form 10-Q, shifts in the mix of customers and products, competitive-pricing pressure, manufacturing-yield issues and wafer pricing. We expect to mitigate any adverse impacts from these factors by continuing to improve yields on our Advanced Products, improve manufacturing efficiencies, and improve average selling price management. The average selling prices of our products generally decline as the products mature. We seek to offset the decrease in selling prices through yield improvement, manufacturing cost reductions and increased unit sales. We also continue to develop higher value products or product features that increase, or slow the decline of, the average selling price of our products. However, there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts will be successful or that they will keep pace with the decline in selling prices of our products, which could ultimately lead to a decline in revenues and have a negative effect on our gross margins.



Research and Development









Selling, General and Administrative







Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles





Amortization expense for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased from the comparable prior year periods. The increase was primarily due to additional amortization expense from intangible assets acquired through the Deephi Tech acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. 



Stock-Based Compensation





The 5% and 4% increase in stock-based compensation expense for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, were primarily related to higher expenses associated with the recent RSU grants that had higher fair value than in the prior years. 



Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net





Our interest and other income (expense), net, was a net expense of $1.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to a net income in the comparable prior year period, a decrease of $6.8 million. For the first nine months of fiscal 2019, our net interest and other income decreased by $6.9 million as compared to the same prior year period. These decreases were primarily due to the losses from investments recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2019. 



Provision for Income Taxes





The decrease in the effective tax rates in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods was primarily due to the initial recording of the provisional estimate for the TCJA's one-time transition tax net of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities on unremitted foreign earnings in fiscal 2018, a remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21% in fiscal 2018, and a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 31.5% in fiscal 2018 to 21% in fiscal 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rates was partially offset by an increase in the provision for income taxes primarily due to the new tax on GILTI in fiscal 2019.



The difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% and our effective tax rate in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the favorable impact of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions, which was partially offset by the new tax on GILTI. The difference between the blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 31.5% and our effective tax rate in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the one-time transition tax net of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities on unremitted foreign earnings.



On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law. The TCJA provides numerous significant tax law changes including the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in our third quarter of fiscal 2018, while other provisions began to impact us in fiscal 2019. The change with the most significant impact to us in fiscal 2019 is the new tax on GILTI.



ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment. However, the SEC staff issued SAB 118 which allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. The FASB allows taxpayers to make an accounting policy election of either (1) treating taxes due on GILTI inclusions as a current-period expense when incurred or (2) recognizing deferred taxes for temporary basis differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI in future years. During the period ended December 29, 2018, the last period covered by SAB 118, we recognized a measurement period adjustment that resulted in a reduction of tax expense of $6.9 million. The adjustment results from our election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences on GILTI. See "Note 14. Income Taxes" to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. "Financial Statements." 



Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources



We have historically used a combination of cash flows from operations and equity as well as debt financing to support ongoing business activities, acquire or invest in critical or complementary technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our common stock and debentures under our repurchase program, pay dividends and finance working capital. Additionally, our investments in debt securities are liquid and available for future business needs.



The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments as of December 29, 2018 and March 31, 2018 totaled $3.55 billion and $3.55 billion, respectively. As of December 29, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.47 billion and working capital of $3.22 billion. As of March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.45 billion and working capital was $3.24 billion.



As of December 29, 2018, we had $1.82 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in our non-U.S. jurisdictions. As a result of the TCJA, substantially all of the $1.82 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our non-U.S. entities is available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. 



Operating Activities —During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, our operations generated net positive cash flow of $803.2 million, which was $225.5 million higher than the $577.7 million generated during the first nine months of fiscal 2018. The positive cash flow from operations generated during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was primarily from net income as adjusted for non-cash related items, increases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable and decreases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets. These items were partially offset by increases in inventories and other assets as well as decrease in income tax payable. Accounts receivable decreased by $22.9 million and days sales outstanding decreased to 44 days at December 29, 2018 from 56 days at March 31, 2018. We had no collectibility issues and our accounts receivable remained current as of December 29, 2018. We expect our accounts receivable to fluctuate as we partner with our distributors to manage their inventory requirements. Our inventory levels as of December 29, 2018 were $47.2 million higher at $283.3 million compared to $236.1 million at March 31, 2018 to support our revenue growth, while the combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution decreased slightly to 118 days at December 29, 2018 from 119 days at March 31, 2018. 



Investing Activities —Net cash used in investing activities was $591.5 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2019, as compared to $318.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of $233.9 million for Deephi acquisition, $60.8 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment and other intangibles, $259.2 million of net purchases of available-for-sale securities and $37.6 million of other investing activities.



Financing Activities —Net cash used in financing activities was $461.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, as compared to $314.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Net cash used in financing activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of $272.9 million dividend payments to stockholders, $161.6 million of cash payment to repurchase shares of common stock and $42.0 million of payment for RSU withholdings. These items were partially offset by $18.4 million proceeds from issuance of common stock.



Contractual Obligations



We lease some of our facilities, office buildings and land under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through April 2029. See "Note 15. Commitments" to our condensed consolidated financial statements, included in Part I. "Financial Information," for a schedule of our operating lease commitments as of December 29, 2018 and additional information about operating leases.





As of December 29, 2018, we had $489.4 million of liabilities classified as long-term income taxes payable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Of the $489.4 million, $468.3 million was the estimated long-term portion of the one-time transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the TCJA, which is payable in eight annual installments. The first installment was paid in 



the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The second installment is classified as a current income tax payable. The installment amounts are equal to 8% of the total liability, payable in fiscal 2019 through 2023, 15% in fiscal 2024, 20% in fiscal 2025, and 25% in fiscal 2026. See “Note 14. Income Taxes” to our condensed consolidated financial statements, included in “Part I. Financial Information,” for additional information about the one-time transition tax. The remaining $21.1 million of the long-term income taxes payable is for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties. Due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with such liabilities, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.



Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements



As of December 29, 2018, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.



Liquidity and Capital Resources



Cash generated from operations is used as our primary source of liquidity and capital resources. Our investment portfolio is also available for future cash requirements as is our $400.0 million revolving credit facility entered into in December 2016 (expiring in December 2021). We are not aware of any lack of access to the revolving credit facility; however, we can provide no assurance that access to the revolving credit facility will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. Our revolving credit facility is not reliant upon a single bank. There have been no borrowings to date under our existing revolving credit facility.





We anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity, to procure additional capital equipment and facilities, to develop new products, and to potentially acquire technologies or businesses that could complement our business. However, the risk factors discussed in Item 1A "Risk Factors" included in Part II, "Other Information" and below could affect our cash positions adversely.



Item 2.Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds



On May 16, 2016, the Board authorized the 2016 Repurchase Program to repurchase of up to $1.00 billion of shares of our common stock and debentures. The 2016 Repurchase Program has no stated expiration date. Through December 29, 2018, we have used $953.7 million of the $1.00 billion authorized under the 2016 Repurchase Program, leaving $46.3 million available for future purchases. On May 16, 2018, the Board authorized the 2018 Repurchase Program to repurchase the Company's common stock and debentures up to $500.0 million.
