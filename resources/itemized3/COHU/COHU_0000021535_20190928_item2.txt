OVERVIEW 



Cohu is a leading supplier of semiconductor test and inspection handlers, micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) test modules, test contactors and thermal subsystems, semiconductor automated test equipment and bare-board printed circuit board test systems used by global semiconductor and electronics manufacturers and test subcontractors. We offer a wide range of products and services and our revenue from capital equipment products is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their business. The level of capital expenditures by these companies depends on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductor devices and PCBs and the products that incorporate them. Our consumable products are driven by the number of semiconductor devices and printed circuit boards that are tested and by the continuous introduction of new products and new technologies by our customers. As a result, our consumable products provide a more stable recurring source of revenue and generally do not have the same degree of cyclicality as our capital equipment products. 



For the nine months ended September 28, 2019, our net sales increased 57% year-over-year to $441.3 million. The increase in our net sales was driven by the acquisition of Xcerra Corporation, completed on October 1, 2018, and our results in the first nine months of 2019 included sales of $238.9 million contributed by this acquired business. Current market weakness is being driven by lower smartphone unit shipments, weaker automotive semiconductor demand and ongoing softness in the China market that is in part related to trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the impact of export restrictions to Huawei on our customers. 



The global semiconductor market grew in 2018 reaching a peak in the second quarter with business conditions softening during the second half of 2018. This weakness has continued through the first nine months of 2019 and customer test cell utilization remains below levels that have historically triggered the need for additional capacity. The current near-term outlook for the semiconductor industry for the remainder of 2019 assumes slower electronic equipment demand and slower growth for the global economy. Despite the near-term weakness, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business due to increasing ubiquity of semiconductors, the future rollout of 5G networks, diminishing impact of parallel test, increasing semiconductor complexity, increasing quality demands from semiconductor customers, and continued proliferation of electronics in a variety of products across the automotive, mobility and industrial markets. We are focused on growing our market share with semiconductor and electronics manufacturers and test subcontractors. 



Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 



Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience, forecasts and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.

 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations















We conduct our annual impairment test as of October 1st of each year, and have determined there was no impairment as of October 1, 2018, as we determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values on that date. Other events and changes in circumstances may also require goodwill to be tested for impairment between annual measurement dates. As of September 28, 2019, we do not believe that circumstances have occurred that indicate impairment of our goodwill is more-likely-than-not. In the event we determine that an interim goodwill impairment review is required, in a future period, the review may result in an impairment charge, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. 



Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 



Recent Transactions Impacting Results of Operations 



On October 1, 2018 we completed the acquisition of Xcerra Corporation and the results of its operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements only since that date. Management has determined that the fixtures services business, that was acquired as part of Xcerra, does not align with Cohu’s long-term strategic plan and management is in the process of divesting this portion of the business. As a result, the assets of our fixtures business are considered “held for sale” and the operations of our fixtures business are considered “discontinued operations” as of September 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018. Unless otherwise indicated, the discussion below covers the comparative results from continuing operations. 







Third Quarter of Fiscal 2019 Compared to Third Quarter of Fiscal 2018 



Net Sales 



Our consolidated net sales increased 66.5% to $143.5 million in 2019, compared to $86.2 million in 2018. On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Xcerra and our net sales for the third fiscal quarter of 2019 include $81.3 million of net sales recognized by this business and is the driver of the increase in our net sales. Excluding the impact of the additional sales from Xcerra, net sales decreased year over year as a result of softer demand for smartphones, weaker automotive semiconductor demand, ongoing softness in the China market that is in part related to trade tensions between the U.S. and China and export restrictions.

Gross Margin (exclusive of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets described below) 



Gross margin consists of net sales less cost of sales. Cost of sales consists primarily of the materials, assembly and test labor and overhead from operations. Our gross margin can fluctuate due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the mix and volume of products sold, product support costs, increases to inventory reserves or the sale of previously reserved inventory and utilization of manufacturing capacity. Our gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 41.1% in 2019 and 40.6% in 2018. As discussed above certain items which have historically affected gross margin are now being reflected in operating expenses. Previously reported amounts were also adjusted to reflect current period presentation. This resulted in expenses totaling $7.6 million and $0.6 million being reported in amortization of intangibles rather than cost of sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Independent of the impact of the financial statement reclassifications gross margin in 2019 was impacted by the acquisition of Xcerra as discussed below. 



Our gross margin can be impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess, obsolete and lower of cost or net realizable value inventory issues. We compute the majority of our excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a one-year inventory usage forecast. During the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, we recorded charges to cost of sales of $1.5 million and $0.7 million for excess and obsolete inventory, respectively. Additionally, as part of the integration and restructuring activities related to Xcerra we recorded $19.1 million of inventory related charges related to the decision to end manufacturing of certain of Xcerra’s semiconductor test handler products in the fourth quarter of 2018 which included amounts associated with non-cancelable supplier commitments. 



While we believe our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or net realizable value concerns are adequate to cover known exposures at September 28, 2019, reductions in customer forecasts or continued modifications to products, as a result of our failure to meet specifications or other customer requirements, may result in additional charges to operations that could negatively impact our gross margin in future periods. 











Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets

See Note 2, “Business Acquisitions, Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information with respect to intangible assets. 



Restructuring Charges 



Subsequent to the acquisition of Xcerra on October 1, 2018, during fourth quarter 2018, we began a strategic restructuring program designed to reposition our organization and improve our cost structure as part of our targeted integration plan regarding Xcerra and recorded restructuring charges, exclusive of the inventory related amounts described above, totaling $0.8 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2019. 



See Note 4, “Restructuring Charges” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information with respect to restructuring charges. 



Interest Expense and Income 



Interest expense was $5.0 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2019 as compared to $11,000 in the corresponding period of 2018. The increase was driven primarily by interest associated with the Term B Loan obtained to finance part of the purchase price of Xcerra. 



Interest income was $0.2 million and $0.3 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. 



Income Taxes 



Ordinarily, interim tax provisions are calculated using the estimated effective tax rate (“ETR”) expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. However, when a reliable estimate of the annual ETR cannot be made, the actual ETR for the year-to-date period may be the best estimate of the annual ETR. For the three months ended September 28, 2019, we used the actual year-to-date ETR in computing our tax provision, as a reliable estimate of the 2019 annual ETR cannot be made, since relatively small changes in our projected income produce a significant variation in our ETR. In computing the tax provision for the three months ended September 29, 2018 we used the ETR expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. The ETR on income or loss from continuing operations for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, was (13.9)% and 32.4%, respectively. The tax provision on income or loss from continuing operations in 2019 and 2018 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the lack of a tax benefit on our domestic losses as a result of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, foreign income taxed at different rates, changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, withholding tax, state taxes and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. 



Our German subsidiary’s income tax returns for 2012 to 2016 are currently under routine examination by tax authorities in Germany. We believe our financial statement accruals for income taxes are appropriate. 



Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income 



As a result of the factors set forth above, both loss from continuing operations and net loss was $10.5 million in 2019. Both income from continuing operations and net income was $4.8 million in 2018. 



First Nine Months of Fiscal 2019 Compared to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2018 



Net Sales 



Our consolidated net sales increased 57.0% to $441.3 million in 2019, compared to $281.1 million in 2018. On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Xcerra and our net sales for the first nine months of 2019 include $238.9 million of net sales recognized by this business and is the driver of the increase in our net sales. Excluding the impact of the additional sales from Xcerra, net sales decreased year over year as a result of softer demand for smartphones, weaker automotive semiconductor demand, ongoing softness in the China market that is in part related to trade tensions between the U.S. and China and export restrictions. 



Gross Margin (exclusive of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets described below) 



Our gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 39.8% in 2019 from 41.8% in 2018. Our gross margin can fluctuate due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the mix of products sold, product support costs, inventory reserve adjustments, and utilization of manufacturing capacity. As discussed above certain items which have historically affected gross margin are now being reflected in operating expenses. Previously reported amounts were also adjusted to reflect current period presentation. This resulted in expenses totaling $22.9 million and $2.0 million being reported in amortization of intangibles rather than cost of sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Independent of the impact of the financial statement reclassifications gross margin in 2019 was impacted by the acquisition of Xcerra as discussed below.

 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations





Our cost of sales was impacted by the amortization of inventory step-up related to fair value adjustments to inventory acquired in business combinations. During the first nine months of 2019, we amortized $6.0 million of inventory step-up related to our acquisition of Xcerra. There was no inventory step-up amortized in the corresponding period of 2018. 



In the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 we recorded charges to cost of sales of approximately $3.2 million and $1.3 million for excess and obsolete inventory, respectively. Additionally, as part of the integration and restructuring activities related to Xcerra we recorded $19.1 million of inventory related charges related to the decision to end manufacturing of certain of Xcerra’s semiconductor test handler products in the fourth quarter of 2018 which included amounts associated with non-cancelable supplier commitments. While we believe our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns are adequate to cover known exposures at September 28, 2019, reductions in customer forecasts or continued modifications to products, as a result of our failure to meet specifications or other customer requirements, may result in additional charges to operations that could negatively impact our results of operations and gross margin in future periods. 











Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets

Restructuring Charges 



Subsequent to the acquisition of Xcerra on October 1, 2018, during fourth quarter 2018, we began a strategic restructuring program designed to reposition our organization and improve our cost structure as part of our targeted integration plan regarding Xcerra and recorded restructuring charges, exclusive of the inventory related amounts described above, totaling $10.7 million in the first nine months of 2019. 



See Note 4, “Restructuring Charges” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information with respect to restructuring charges. 



Interest Expense and Income 



Interest expense was $15.8 million in the first nine months of 2019 as compared to $33,000 in the corresponding period of 2018. The increase was driven primarily by interest associated with the Term B Loan obtained to finance part of the purchase price of Xcerra.

 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations





Interest income was $0.6 million and $0.9 million in the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. 



Income Taxes 



The ETR on income or loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, was (0.3)% and 21.9%, respectively. The tax provision on income or loss from continuing operations in 2019 and 2018 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income taxed at different rates, changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, withholding tax, state taxes and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits.  



There was no material change to our unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest and penalties during the nine-month periods ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018. 



Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income 



As a result of the factors set forth above, our loss from continuing operations and net loss was $52.7 million and $52.4 million in 2019, respectively, as compared to income from continuing operations and net income of $24.6 million in 2018. 



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 



Our primary business is dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and test subcontractors that are, in turn, dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors. The seasonal and volatile nature of demand for semiconductor equipment, our primary industry, makes estimates of future revenues, results of operations and net cash flows difficult. 



Our primary historical source of liquidity and capital resources has been cash flow generated by our operations and we manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as our primary source of liquidity. We use cash to fund growth in our operating assets and to fund new products and product enhancements primarily through research and development. As of September 28, 2019, $82.5 million or 56.6% of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we may be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding taxes if we repatriate these funds. Except for working capital requirements in certain jurisdictions, we provide for all withholding and other residual taxes related to unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Beginning in 2018, earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions will be subject to U.S. tax in accordance with the Tax Act. 



On October 1, 2018, we entered into a bank credit agreement which provides for a $350.0 million seven-year Term B Loan facility and borrowed the full amount. The Term B Loan facility matures on October 1, 2025. These proceeds were used on October 1, 2018, together with our cash and cash equivalents and newly issued Cohu common stock, to finance the acquisition of Xcerra. See Note 3 “Borrowings and Credit Agreements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 



At September 28, 2019, our total indebtedness, net of discount and deferred financing costs, was $351.3 million, which included $338.8 million outstanding under the Term B Loan, $4.0 million outstanding under Kita’s term loans, $3.7 million outstanding under Rasco’s term loan, $3.3 million outstanding under Kita’s lines of credit, and $1.5 million outstanding under Xcerra’s term loan.

Capital Resources 



In addition to the bank credit agreement which provides for a $350.0 million seven-year Term B Loan facility as described above, we have access to other credit facilities to finance our operations if needed. 



As a result of our acquisition of Xcerra, we assumed a term loan related to the purchase of Xcerra’s facility in Rosenheim, Germany. The loan is payable over 10 years at an annual interest rate of 2.35%. Principal plus accrued interest is due quarterly over the duration of the term loan. At September 28, 2019, the outstanding loan balance was $1.5 million and $0.3 million of the outstanding balance is presented as current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The term loan is denominated in Euros and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates. 



In connection with the acquisition of Kita on January 4, 2017, we assumed a series of revolving credit agreements with various financial institutions in Japan. The credit facilities renew monthly and provide Kita with access to working capital totaling up to $8.9 million. At September 28, 2019, total borrowings outstanding under the revolving lines of credit were $3.3 million. As these credit facility agreements renew monthly, they have been included in short-term borrowings in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We also have long-term term loans from a series of Japanese financial institutions totaling $4.0 million primarily related to the expansion of Kita’s facility in Osaka, Japan. The loans are collateralized by the facility and land. The loans carry interest rates ranging from 0.05% to 0.44% and expire at various dates through 2034. At September 28, 2019, $0.5 million of the term loans have been included in current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The revolving lines of credit and term loans are denominated in Japanese Yen and, as a result, amounts will fluctuate as a result of changes in currency exchange rates. 



On July 26, 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary Rasco GmbH entered into a term loan agreement with a financial institution that provides it with €3.4 million (Euro) that is being used to finance the expansion of our facility in Kolbermoor, Germany. The facility expansion project will allow us to combine the operations of multiple subsidiaries in one location as part of our strategic restructuring program. The loan is secured by the land and the existing building on the site. Interest on the loan is payable quarterly and is fixed for 10 years at an annual interest rate of 0.8%. Principal repayments will be made over 8 years starting at the end of 2021. Only interest will be due each quarter starting in September 2019 and principal plus accrued interest will be due each quarter starting at the end of December, 2021. At September 28, 2019, the outstanding loan balance was $3.7 million with none of the outstanding balance being presented as current installments of long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets based on contractual due dates. The term loan is denominated in Euros and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates.

We also have a credit agreement with a financial institution under which it administers a line of credit on behalf of our wholly owned Ismeca subsidiary. The agreement provides Ismeca with 2.0 million Swiss Francs of available credit and at September 28, 2019, no amounts were outstanding. 



We have a letter of credit facility (the “LC Facility”) under which Bank of America, N.A., has agreed to administer the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf. The LC Facility requires us to maintain deposits of cash or other approved investments in amounts that approximate our outstanding letters of credit and contains customary restrictive covenants. In addition, our wholly owned subsidiary, Xcerra, has arrangements with various financial institutions for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees. As of September 28, 2019, $1.3 million was outstanding under standby letters of credit and bank guarantees. 



We expect that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and we anticipate that present working capital will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months.
