Results of Operations





Overview







The fiscal year ending November 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019) is a 52-week year and the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018) was a 53-week year. The additional week in fiscal 2018 was included in the first quarter ended February 3, 2018. Therefore, the first three months of fiscal 2019 included one less week of operations as compared to the first three months of fiscal 2018.



Revenue Trends by End Market



The following tables summarize revenue by end market for the three-month periods ended February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the “sold to” customer information, the “ship to” customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.







Industrial, Automotive and Consumer end market revenues decreased in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of one less week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, Consumer end market revenues decreased in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year as a result of decreased demand for products used in portable consumer applications. Communications end market revenue increased in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as a result of a broad-based increase in demand for our products sold into this end market, partially offset by one less week of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018.



Revenue by Sales Channel









Gross Margin







Gross margin percentage decreased by 90 basis points in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of a higher concentration of our revenue from lower margin products.



















Special Charges



We monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, as well as a better alignment of expenses with revenues. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years.





See Note 6, Special Charges, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.



Operating Income









Nonoperating Expense (Income)





The year-over-year decrease in nonoperating expense in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019 was primarily the result of a decrease in interest expense and lower amortized finance fees, which were accelerated as a result of principal repayments related to our 3-year term loan. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to debt issuances in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.



Provision for Income Taxes







Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective income tax rate can also be impacted each year by discrete factors or events.



The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Legislation), enacted in December 2017, contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Legislation as described in Note 12, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.



Our tax rate for the three-month period ended February 2, 2019 was below the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income, and as a result of the foreign derived intangible income deduction (FDII) partially offset by the global intangible low-tax income (GILTI) tax. The tax rate also includes the effects of recording deferred tax benefits relating to a one-time set up of our GILTI deferred method election of $5.1 million along with the completion of our accounting for the transition tax which yielded a $7.5 million tax benefit. Our tax rate for the three-month period ended February 3, 2018 was below our then blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 23.4%, resulting from the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. Additionally, our effective tax rate for the three-month period ended February 3, 2018 also included a provisional estimate for a discrete tax benefit of $639.7 million from remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower 21% statutory tax rate. It also included a provisional estimate of the discrete tax charge of $687.1 million from the Tax Legislation’s one-time transition tax associated with our undistributed foreign earnings, comprised of a $751.1 million transitional tax less a deferred tax liability of $64.0 million recorded in prior years.



In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Legislation, in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, resulting in no material change to our estimate of the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the recording of an additional tax benefit of $7.5 million for a change to our estimate for the transition tax due to the finalization of the aggregate foreign cash positions. 



Additionally, we recorded discrete benefits for excess tax benefits from share-based payments of $4.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to $10.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The full year tax benefit from share-based payments was $26.2 million in fiscal 2018. 



Non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for a significant portion of our total revenues for the three-month period ended February 





2, 2019. This revenue generated outside of the U.S. results in a material portion of our pretax income being taxed outside the U.S., primarily in Ireland and Singapore, at tax rates ranging from 12.5% to 17%. 



Non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for a significant portion of our total revenues for the three-month period ended February 3, 2018. This revenue generated outside of the U.S. resulted in a material portion of our pretax income being taxed outside the U.S., primarily in Bermuda, Ireland and Singapore, at tax rates ranging from 0% to 12.5%.



See Note 12, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion. 



Net Income







Net income increased in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year,as a result of a $14.0 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $10.6 million decrease in nonoperating expense and a $37.2 million decrease in provision for income taxes.



Liquidity and Capital Resources



At February 2, 2019, our principal source of liquidity was $605.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $231.7 million was held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. We continue to assert our intent to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely. As we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, certain cash held outside the United States may not be available for repatriation as dividends to the United States in the future. If such funds are needed for U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes to the extent not already subject to taxation. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk. 



We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.







At February 2, 2019, cash and cash equivalents totaled $605.9 million. The following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.



Operating Activities



Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.





The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of changes in working capital, partially offset by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items, as the first quarter of fiscal 2018 included changes to income tax related to the Tax Legislation.



Investing Activities



Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, as well as cash used for acquisitions.



The increase in cash used for investing activities during the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily the result of an increase in capital spending. 



Financing Activities 



Financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans.



The change in cash related to financing activities during the three-month period ended February 2, 2019, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily due to a decrease in repayments on our 3-year unsecured term loan, partially offset by increases in stock repurchases and dividend payments. 



Working Capital







The increase in accounts receivable in dollars was primarily the result of normal variations in the timing of collections and billings.



Inventory in dollars increased, primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand. 



Current liabilities decreased to $850.0 million at February 2, 2019 from $1.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2018. The decrease was a result of a decrease in the current portion of our debt, income taxes payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily a result of a decrease in accrued employee compensation and benefits, partially offset by an increase in accrued special charges. 



Debt





$500.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.875% Senior Unsecured Notes (2023 Notes)



On June 3, 2013, we issued the 2023 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2013.



$850.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.9% Senior Unsecured Notes (2025 Notes) and $400.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 5.3% Senior Unsecured Notes (2045 Notes)





On December 14, 2015, we issued the 2025 Notes and the 2045 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2016. 



$400.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2021 Notes), $550.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.125% Senior Unsecured Notes (December 2023 Notes), $900.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2026 Notes) and $250.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 4.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2036 Notes)



On December 5, 2016, we issued the 2021 Notes, the December 2023 Notes, the 2026 Notes and the 2036 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 5 and December 5 of each year, commencing June 5, 2017. 



$300.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.85% Senior Unsecured Notes (2020 Notes) and $450.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.95% Senior Unsecured Notes (January 2021 Notes)



On March 12, 2018, we issued the 2020 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on March 12 and September 12 of each year, commencing September 12, 2018, and the January 2021 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on January 12 and July 12 of each year, commencing July 12, 2018.





$5.0 Billion Aggregate Principal Term Loans



On March 10, 2017 in connection with the acquisition of Linear, we drew down on a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2022. The term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.75% and 1.63% in the case of the 3-year unsecured term loan, and a margin of between 0.88% and 1.75% in the case of the 5-year unsecured term loan. As of February 2, 2019, we have paid $2.2 billion of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan and $1.2 billion of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan. 



Revolving Credit Facility 



We have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on July 10, 2020. The agreement for such revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) provides that we may borrow up to $1.0 billion. In December 2018 we borrowed $75.0 million under this revolving credit facility and utilized the proceeds for the repayment of existing indebtedness and working capital requirements. We repaid the $75 million plus interest of $0.2 million in January 2019. We may borrow under this revolving credit facility in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 4.5 to 1.0. The debt covenant will be reduced over time to 3.0 to 1.0, which began in May 2018. As of February 2, 2019, we were compliant with these covenants. 



Stock Repurchase Program





Capital Expenditures



Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $91.0 million in the first three months of fiscal 2019 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 





to be approximately 4% of fiscal 2019 revenue. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.



Dividends



On February 19, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.54 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 12, 2019 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2019 and is expected to total approximately $198.9 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.54 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.



Contractual Obligations



There have not been any material changes during the three-month period ended February 2, 2019 to the amounts presented in the table summarizing our contractual obligations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018.



New Accounting Pronouncements



From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 13, New Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.



Revenue Recognition



In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard, including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations. We adopted ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, using the full retrospective method and restated prior periods. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2014-09, we changed our accounting policy for revenue recognition. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation, and Note 2, Revenue Recognition, in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for details of the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our financial statements.



Income Taxes



In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740) (ASU 2016-16). ASU 2016-16 requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted ASU 2016-16 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method with a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings. The adoption of ASU 2016-16 resulted in a cumulative-effect increase in our deferred tax assets of approximately $1.7 billion and an increase to our deferred tax liabilities of $1.3 billion.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



Except for the accounting policy for revenue recognition that was updated as a result of adopting ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), there were no other material changes in the three-month period ended February 2, 2019 to the information provided under the heading “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018.
