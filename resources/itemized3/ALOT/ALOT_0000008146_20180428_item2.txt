Table of Contents 



Revenue for the first quarter of the current year was $31.5 million, representing a 28.7% increase compared to the previous year first quarter revenue of $24.5 million. Revenue through domestic channels for the current year first quarter was $19.2 million, an increase of 22.6% over the prior years first quarter. International revenue for the first quarter of the current year was $12.3 million, a 39.7% increase over the previous year first quarter and represents 39% of AstroNovas first quarters revenue. Current year first quarter international revenue includes a favorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.8 million.  





Service and other revenues of $2.8 million in the current quarter increased 20.9% from prior year first quarter service and other revenues of $2.3 million, primarily due to an increase in customer demand for repair services and parts during the first quarter of the current year.  



Current year first quarter gross profit was $12.1 million, a 30.1% increase compared to prior year first quarter gross profit of $9.3 million. The Companys current quarter gross profit margin of 38.5% reflects a 0.5 percentage point increase from the prior year first quarter gross profit margin of 38.0%. The higher gross profit and related profit margin for the current quarter compared to prior year is primarily attributable to increased sales and favorable product mix.

Other expense in the first quarter of the fiscal 2019 was $0.3 million compared to $48 thousand in the prior year first quarter. Current quarter other expense includes interest expense on debt of $0.2 million and foreign exchange loss of $0.1 million. Other expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 includes interest expense on debt of $20 thousand and foreign exchange loss of $54 thousand, partially offset by investment and other income of $25 thousand.  



The provision for federal, state and foreign income taxes for the first quarter of the current year was $0.2 million which includes a benefit of $78 thousand related to the statute of limitations expiring on a previous uncertain tax position and a $30 thousand benefit related to windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock and reflects an effective tax rate of 18.2%. This compares to the prior years first quarter tax provision on income of $0.1 million which included a benefit of $71 thousand related to the statute of limitations expiring on a previous uncertain tax position and a $14 thousand benefit related to windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock and reflected an effective tax rate of 22.3%.  



The Company reported net income of $0.8 million or $0.12 per diluted share for the first quarter of the current year, which included after-tax income of $0.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, as a result of a change in accounting estimates for product cost and operating expenses related to a transition services agreement entered into with Honeywell in connection with the Honeywell Agreement. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, a change in accounting estimate for revenue subject to customer rebates under the Honeywell Agreement increased net income by $0.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share. On a comparable basis, net income for the prior year first quarter was $0.5 million or $0.07 per diluted share. Return on revenue was 2.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 2.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

Segment Analysis  







Product Identification  



Revenue from the Product Identification segment increased 7.0% in the first quarter of the current year, with revenue of $20.0 million compared to $18.6 million in the same period of the prior year. Hardware revenue increased 6.3% compared to prior year primarily due to the increase in demand for Kiaro! brand printers. The current year first quarter also received a strong contribution from the supplies product line revenue which increased 7.2% from the same period in the prior year. The current quarter increase in supplies revenue is due to the continued increase in demand for digital color printer supplies, which has experienced double-digit growth in the current year first quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in sales of label and tag products for the current quarter also contributed to the increase in supplies revenue. The Product Identification segment current quarter segment operating profit was $1.7 million, reflecting a profit margin of 8.3%. This compares to prior years first quarter segment profit of $2.5 million and related profit margin of 13.3%. The decline in Product Identification current year first quarter segment operating margin is primarily due to product mix and higher manufacturing and operating expenses.

Financial Condition and Liquidity  



Overview  



Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities. We may also utilize amounts available under our revolving credit facility, as described below, to supplement operating activities and to fund a portion of our capital expenditures, contractual contingent consideration obligations, and future acquisitions. We believe that our current level of cash and short-term financing capabilities along with future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.  



During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we converted our securities available for sale to cash. Our cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter were $6.8 million and we had $10.0 million available under our revolving credit facility.  



Indebtedness  



On February 28, 2017, the Company and its wholly owned Danish subsidiaries, ANI ApS and TrojanLabel ApS (together, the Parties), entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (the Lender). The Credit Agreement provided for a term loan to ANI ApS in the principal amount of $9.2 million. The Credit Agreement also provided for a $10.0 million revolving credit facility available to the Company for general corporate purposes.  



In connection with the Honeywell Purchase and License Agreement, on September 28, 2017, the Parties entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender. The First Amendment amended the existing Credit Agreement to permit the Honeywell Agreement and temporarily increased the amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility from $10.0 million to $15.0 million. The initial upfront payment of $14.6 million for the Honeywell Agreement was paid using borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility.  



On November 30, 2017, the Parties entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender. The Second Amendment provided for a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million, in addition to the revolving credit facility for the Company and the term loan previously borrowed by ANI ApS at the original closing under the Credit Agreement. The proceeds from the term loan were used to repay the entire $14.6 million principal balance of the revolving loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The principal amount of the revolving credit facility which had been temporarily increased to $15.0 million was reduced to $10.0 million effective upon closing of the Second Amendment and the maturity date was extended to November 30, 2022.  



On April 17, 2018, the Parties entered into a Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender. The Third Amendment provides that no Immaterial Subsidiary will be required to become a guarantor or securing party under (unless requested by the Lender during default) or have its equity pledged pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment defines Immaterial Subsidiary as any subsidiary of the Company with (a) consolidated total assets that do not exceed 5.0% of the consolidated total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and (b) revenues that do not exceed 5.0% of the consolidated revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries, as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter; provided that Immaterial Subsidiaries shall not account for, in the aggregate, more than 10% the of consolidated total assets or consolidated revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries.  



In connection with the Credit Agreement, AstroNova and ANI ApS entered into certain hedging arrangements with the Lender to manage the variable interest rate risk and currency risk associated with its payments in respect of the term loans.  



Revolving credit loans may be borrowed, at the Companys option, in U.S. Dollars or, subject to certain conditions, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars or Danish Krone. Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, either (a) the LIBOR rate (or in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, the applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of Americas publicly announced prime rate or (iii) the LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.0% to 0.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility at the rate of 0.25% per annum.  



The obligations of ANI ApS in respect of the $9.2 million term loan are guaranteed by the Company and TrojanLabel. The Companys obligations in respect of the $15.0 million term loan, revolving credit facility and its guarantee in respect of the ANI ApS term loan are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (including a pledge of a portion of the equity interests held by the Company in ANI ApS and the Companys wholly-owned German subsidiary Astro-Med GmbH), subject to certain exceptions.  



The Parties must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.  



The Lender is entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans and to terminate its revolving credit commitment under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of various customary events of default.  



As of April 28, 2018, there were no borrowings against the revolving credit facility and we believe the Company is in compliance with all of the covenants in the Credit Agreement.

Cash Flow  



The Companys statements of cash flows for the three months ended April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017 are included on page 6 of this report. Net cash used by operating activities was $2.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $0.8 million for the same period of the previous year. The increase in net cash used by operations for the current quarter is primarily due to increased cash used for working capital and increase in non-cash amortization related to the Honeywell acquisition. The combination of changes in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased cash by $5.0 million in for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to a decrease of $2.1 million for the same period in fiscal 2018. The accounts receivable balance increased to $25.3 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $22.4 at year end and the collection cycle increased to 63 days compared to 55 days at year end. The inventory balance was $27.7 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to $27.6 million at year end and inventory days on hand increased to 129 days at the end of the current quarter from 124 days at the prior year end.  



The decreased cash and investment position at April 28, 2018, primarily resulted from increased cash used in operations as discussed above, principal payments of long-term debt of $1.8 million, dividends paid of $0.5 million and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $0.5 million.  



The Companys backlog increased 11.7% from year-end to $23.9 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  



Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies  



There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as disclosed in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018, other than those which occur in the ordinary course of business.  



Critical Accounting Policies, Commitments and Certain Other Matters  



In the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018, the Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which our financial status depends were identified as those relating to revenue recognition, warranty claims, bad debts, inventories, income taxes, long-lived assets, goodwill and share-based compensation. We considered the disclosure requirements of Financial Release (FR) 60 regarding critical accounting policies and FR-61 regarding liquidity and capital resources, certain trading activities and related party disclosures, and concluded that nothing materially changed during the quarter that would warrant further disclosure under these releases.
