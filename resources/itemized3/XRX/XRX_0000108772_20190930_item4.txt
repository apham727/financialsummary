As required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, we evaluated changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter. There were no changes identified in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 



In March 2019, the Company entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we are outsourcing certain global administrative and support functions, including, among others, selected information technology, order to collection and finance functions (excluding accounting). The transition of these functions to HCL is expected to take up to 18 months. HCL is expected to make certain up-front and ongoing investments in software, tools and other technology to consolidate, optimize and automate the transferred functions. This arrangement is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this arrangement, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment. Refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
