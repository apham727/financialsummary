For the three months ended January 31, 2018, cloud services Annual Contract Value (ACV) increased approximately 125% to $10.9 million compared to $4.9 million in the same period of the prior year. ACV is comprised of software-as-a-service (SaaS) ACV of $8.1 million compared to approximately $2.6 million during the same period last year and other cloud services ACV of $2.8 million compared to $2.3 million during the same period last year.
