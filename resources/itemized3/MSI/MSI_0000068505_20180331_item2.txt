Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations



This commentary should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto of Motorola Solutions, Inc. (“Motorola Solutions” or the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017, as well as our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.



Executive Overview



Recent Developments



On March 28, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Avigilon Corporation, a provider of advanced end-to-end security and surveillance solutions including video analytics, network video management hardware and software, surveillance cameras and access control solutions for a purchase price of $974 million.



On March 7, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Plant Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Airbus DS Communications for a purchase price of $237 million. This acquisition expands our software portfolio in the Command Center with additional solutions for Next Generation 9-1-1. 



We adopted ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", and all the related amendments (collectively “ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to our opening retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect in those periods. The impact from adoption increased Net sales by $15 million.

Results of Operations









Results of Operations—Three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to three months ended April 1, 2017 



The results of operations for the first quarter of 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. Historically, we have experienced higher revenues in the fourth quarter as compared to the rest of the quarters of our fiscal year as a result of the purchasing patterns of our customers.



Net Sales





Gross Margin 



Gross margin was $669 million, or 45.6% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $570 million, or 44.5% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by a favorable mix in the Products segment. 



Selling, General and Administrative Expenses





Research and Development Expenditures





Other Charges







Net Interest Expense



Net interest expense was $46 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $51 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in net interest expense in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 was a result of higher interest income due to amounts associated with a tax refund received within the first quarter of 2018.



Gains (losses) on Sales of Investments and Businesses, net



Net gains on sales of investments and businesses were $11 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net gains of $3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The net gains in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 were related to sales of various equity investments.



Other







Effective Tax Rate



We recorded $23 million of net tax expense in the first quarter of 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate of 16%, compared to $42 million of net tax expense in the first quarter of 2017, resulting in an effective tax rate of 35%. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of 16% is lower than our effective tax rate for the three months ended April 1, 2017 of 35%, primarily due to the corporate income tax rate decrease from 35% to 21%, as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) enacted December 22, 2017. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily driven by a tax benefit due to the recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2017 was equal to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%. 



Net Earnings Attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc.



After taxes, we had net earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. of $117 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to net earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. of $77 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.





Segment Information



The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each reporting segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017, as detailed in Note 12, “Segment Information,” of our condensed consolidated financial statements.



Products Segment



For both the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, the segment’s net sales represented 55% of our consolidated net sales.





Three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to three months ended April 1, 2017 



The segment’s net sales increased $98 million, to $801 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $703 million during the first quarter of 2017. The increase in the segment's net sales was driven by an increase in both Systems and Devices sales. Devices net sales increased in the Americas and EMEA. Systems net sales increased in EMEA and AP. 



Net sales in the Americas continued to comprise a significant portion of the segment’s business, accounting for approximately 76% of the segment’s net sales in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 75% of the segment's net sales in the first quarter of 2017. 





Services Segment



For both the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, the segment’s net sales represented 45% of our consolidated net sales.







Three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to three months ended April 1, 2017 





Net sales in the Americas continued to comprise a significant portion of the segment’s business, accounting for approximately 59% of the segment’s net sales in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 58% of the segment’s net sales in the first quarter of 2017.





Reorganization of Business



During the first quarter of 2018, we recorded net reorganization of business charges of $13 million including $8 million of charges recorded within Other charges and $5 million in Cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the $13 million were charges of $22 million related to employee separation costs and $2 million related to exit costs, partially offset by $11 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.



During the first quarter of 2017, we recorded net reorganization of business charges of $19 million including $15 million of charges recorded within Other charges and $4 million in Cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the $19 million were charges of $15 million related to employee separation costs and $4 million for exit costs.







Cash payments for employee severance and exit costs in connection with the reorganization of business plans were $15 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $30 million in the first quarter of 2017. The reorganization of business accruals at March 31, 2018 were $48 million, of which $39 million relate to employee separation costs that are expected to be paid within one year and $9 million of accruals related primarily to lease termination obligations that are expected to be paid over a number of years.



Liquidity and Capital Resources





Cash and Cash Equivalents



At March 31, 2018, $440 million of the $858 million cash and cash equivalents balance was held in the U.S. and approximately $418 million was held by us or our subsidiaries in other countries. Restricted cash was $63 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 



Operating Activities



Net cash used for operating activities in the first quarter of 2018 was $500 million, as compared to $142 million provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2017. Operating cash flows in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the first quarter of 2017, were negatively impacted by the $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan, higher incentive payments, higher tax payments and the recovery of financial receivables owed to us in the first quarter of 2017. The contribution to our U.S. pension plan moves the next anticipated required contribution to 2024, or beyond.





Investing Activities











Financing Activities







To complete the acquisition of Avigilon during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we entered into a term loan for $400 million and a maturity date of March 26, 2021 (the “Term Loan”). Interest on the Term Loan is variable and indexed to LIBOR. Interest is payable quarterly. The weighted average borrowing rate for amounts outstanding during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 3.54%. Net proceeds after issuance costs were $399 million. No additional borrowings are permitted and amounts borrowed and repaid or prepaid may not be re-borrowed. 



In February of 2018, we issued $500 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2028. After debt issuance costs and debt discounts, we recognized net proceeds of $497 million. These proceeds were then used to make a $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan.



On August 25, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Silver Lake Partners to issue $1.0 billion of 2.00% Senior Convertible Notes which mature in September 2020. The notes became fully convertible as of August 25, 2017. The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 14.7476, as may be adjusted for dividends declared, per $1,000 principal amount (which is currently equal to a conversion price of $67.81 per share). The exercise price adjusts automatically for dividends. In the event of conversion, the notes may be settled in either cash or stock, at our discretion. We intend to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash.



We have investment grade ratings on our senior unsecured long-term debt from the three largest U.S. national rating agencies. We continue to believe that we will be able to maintain sufficient access to the capital markets. Any future disruptions, uncertainty, or volatility in the capital markets, or deterioration in our credit ratings, may result in higher funding costs for us and adversely affect our ability to access funds.









Credit Facilities



As of March 31, 2018, we had a $2.2 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in April 2022 (the "2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement"), of which $400 million was borrowed as of March 31, 2018 to facilitate the Avigilon acquisition. The 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a $500 million letter of credit sub-limit with $450 million of fronting commitments. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), at our option. The weighted average borrowing rate on outstanding amounts was 3.25%. An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if our credit rating changes. We must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of March 31, 2018. 



Long-Term Customer Financing Commitments





Sales of Receivables







At March 31, 2018, the Company had retained servicing obligations for $848 million of long-term receivables, compared to $873 million at December 31, 2017. Servicing obligations are limited to collection activities related to the sales of accounts receivables and long-term receivables. 



Other Contingencies







Some of these obligations arise as a result of divestitures of our assets or businesses and require us to indemnify the other party against losses arising from breaches of representations and warranties and covenants and, in some cases, the settlement of pending obligations. Our obligations under divestiture agreements for indemnification based on breaches of representations and warranties are generally limited in terms of duration, and for amounts for breaches of such representations and warranties in connection with prior divestitures not in excess of a percentage of the contract value. We had no accruals for any such obligations at March 31, 2018.







Recent Accounting Pronouncements



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2019 and interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The ASU prescribes the use of a modified retrospective method upon adoption, which requires all prior periods presented in the financial statements to be restated, with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. We have begun to assess the impact of the ASU on our financial statements and expect a material impact to our balance sheet through the recording of right-of-use assets and lease obligations that were not required to be recorded within the balance sheet under current accounting standards. We have also begun to catalog our existing lease contracts and identify changes needed to systems and processes.





Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements





We adopted ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective method of adoption. The amendments in the ASU require that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic cost (benefit) and report that component in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. The other components of net periodic cost (benefit) are required to be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and outside of operating earnings. We have restated our comparative period results to reflect the application of the presentation guidance of the ASU. As a result of the ASU, the presentation of net periodic cost (benefit) has been updated to classify all components of our net periodic benefit, with the exception of the service cost component, within Other in Other income (expense) on the statement of operations. We reclassified $20 million and $3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017, respectively.



We adopted ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", and all the related amendments (collectively “ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to our opening retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect in those periods.







Under the new standard, revenue recognition for software sales is accelerated based on when control of software licenses and related support services are transferred to the customer. Amounts deferred under previous software accounting rules due to a lack of vendor-specific objective evidence have been recognized as an adjustment through opening retained earnings.



 Historically, we presented transactions that involved a third-party sales representative on a net basis. After considering the control concept and the remaining three indicators of gross presentation under the new standard, we have determined that we are the principal in contracts that involve a third-party sales representative. Thus, we present associated revenues on a gross 





basis, with the affect being an equal increase to selling, general and administrative expenses for our cost of third-party commissions.



Under prior accounting standards, we expensed sales commissions and other costs to obtain a contract as incurred. However, under the new standard, we capitalize sales commissions and certain other costs as incremental costs to obtain a contract. Such costs are classified as a non-current contract cost assets within Other assets and amortized over a period that approximates the timing of revenue recognition on the underlying contracts.



The new standard clarified the definition of a receivable and requires us to present our net position in a contract with a customer on the balance sheet. The position is presented as either a receivable, contract asset, or a contract liability. Under the new definition, accounts receivable are unconditional rights to consideration from a customer. Contract assets represent rights to consideration from a customer in exchange for transferred goods and services that are conditional on events other than the passage of time. Contract liabilities represent obligations to transfer goods and services for which we have received, or is due, consideration from a customer respectively. We reclassified our customer positions to align with the new definitions and presentation guidance. Accordingly, Unbilled accounts receivable and Costs and earnings in excess of billings have been reclassified from Accounts receivable and Other current assets, respectively, and are presented as Contract assets. Accounts receivable which are not due from customers have been reclassified into Other current assets. Deferred revenue, Billings in excess of costs and earnings, and Customer downpayments have been reclassified from Accrued liabilities and are presented as Contract liabilities. Non-current deferred revenue has been reclassified from Deferred revenue to Non-current contract liabilities within Other liabilities.
