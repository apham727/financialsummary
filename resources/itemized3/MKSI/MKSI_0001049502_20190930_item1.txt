Basis of Presentation   



The terms “MKS” and the “Company” refer to MKS Instruments, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The interim financial data as of September 30, 2019, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 are unaudited; however, in the opinion of MKS, the interim data includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The condensed consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2018 has been derived from the consolidated audited financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 



10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the MKS Annual Report on Form 



10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2019.  



The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an 



on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, inventory, intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets, warranty liabilities, pension liabilities, acquisition expenses, income taxes and investments. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   



In October 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 



2018-16,  “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815).” This standard permits the use of the Overnight Index Swap Rate (“OIS”) based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815 in addition to the interest rates on direct treasury obligations of the U.S. government, the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) swap rate, the OIS rate based on the Federal Funds Effective Rate and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Rate. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this ASU during the first quarter of 2019 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 



In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 





Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 





internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an 



internal-use software license). The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments to this update. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of this ASU and 



the impact of pending adoption on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 



In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 



2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815).” This standard better aligns an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this ASU during the first quarter of 2019 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 



2016-02, “Leases”. This standard requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for all leases, with certain exceptions, on the balance sheet. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 



2016-02 on January 1, 2019, and used the effective date as its date of initial application. As such, the Company did not adjust prior period amounts. The Company also elected to adopt the package of practical expedients upon transition, which permits companies to not reassess lease identification, classification, and initial direct costs for leases that commenced prior to the effective date.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  





The Company implemented internal controls and a lease accounting information system to enable preparation on adoption. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of initially applying this new standard, resulting in the addition of $71,042 of 



right-of-use assets and $20,192 and $54,147 of short-term and long-term lease liabilities, respectively. The 



right-of-use asset is net of the deferred rent liability, prepaid rent and a net favorable lease asset which were 



re-classified to the 



right-of-use asset upon adoption of the standard. For additional information on the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this standard, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.

the impact of pending 



adoption on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.   





Leases   



The Company has various operating leases for real estate and 



non-real estate items. The 



non-real estate leases are mainly comprised of automobiles but also include copiers, printers and other lower-valued items. The Company does not have any finance leases. 



The Company has lease arrangements with lease and 



non-lease components, has elected to account for the lease and 



non-lease  components as a single lease component, and has allocated all of the contract consideration to the lease component only. The Company has existing net leases in which the 



non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance, maintenance, consumables, etc.) are paid separately from rent based on actual costs incurred. Therefore, 



non-lease components are not included in the 



right-of-use asset and lease liability and are reflected as expenses in the periods incurred. 



The Company has existing leases that include variable lease and 



non-lease components that are not included in the 



right-of-use  asset and lease liability, and are reflected as expenses in the periods incurred. Such payments primarily include common area maintenance charges and increases in rent payments that are driven by factors such as future changes in an index (e.g., the Consumer Price Index). 



A 



right-of-use asset of $67,632, short-term lease liability of $20,575 and long-term lease liability of $47,294 were reflected on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2019. 





The weighted average discount rate and the weighted average remaining lease term were 3.8





 years, respectively, for the period ended September 30

The tables above, which show the gross unrealized gains and (losses) aggregated by investment category for 



available-for-sale  investments as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, reflect the inclusion within short-term investments of investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of purchase. Management has the ability, if necessary, to liquidate any of its investments in order to meet the Company’s liquidity needs in the next 12 months. Accordingly, those investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of purchase are classified as short-term on the accompanying balance sheets.



The Company reviews and evaluates its investments for any indication of possible impairment. Based on this review, the Company has determined that the unrealized losses related to these investments at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were temporary.

Interest income is accrued as earned. Dividend income is recognized as income on the date the ​​​​​​​stock trades 



“ex-dividend.” The cost of marketable securities sold is determined by the specific identification method. Realized gains or losses are reflected in income and were not material for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.





Fair Value Measurements 



In accordance with the provisions of fair value accounting, a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability and defines fair value based upon an exit price model



. 







Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities assessed as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  





Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments or securities or derivative contracts that are valued using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.  





Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 



In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the Company categorizes such assets and liabilities based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

Money Market Funds 



Money market funds are cash and cash equivalents and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  



Available-For-Sale Investments 



Available-for-sale investments consisted of time deposits, certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptance drafts, asset-backed securities (which include auto loans, credit card receivables and equipment trust receivables), commercial paper, corporate obligations, U.S. treasury obligations, U.S. agency obligations and group insurance contracts. 



The Company measures its debt and equity investments at fair value. The Company’s 



available-for-sale investments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 



Israeli Pension Assets 



Israeli pension assets represent investments in mutual funds, government securities and other time deposits. These investments are set aside for the retirement benefit of the employees at the Company’s Israeli subsidiaries. These funds are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  



Cost Method Investments  



The Company has a 



non-controlling equity investment in a privately held company. The Company elected the measurement alternative for this investment without readily determinable fair values and for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence. This investment is accounted for under the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method of accounting, the 



non-marketable equity securities are carried at cost less any impairment, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, which is recorded within the statement of operations. The Company holds $4,400 without readily determinable fair values both at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. This investment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 



Derivatives  



As a result of the Company’s global operating activities, the Company is exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and variable interest rates, which may adversely affect its operating results and financial position. When deemed appropriate, the Company minimizes its risks from foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments. The principal market in which the Company executes its foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps is the institutional market in an 



over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency. The market participants usually are large commercial banks. The forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate hedge are valued using broker quotations or market transactions and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.   





Derivatives   



The Company enters into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments and those utilized as economic hedges. The Company operates internationally and, in the normal course of business, is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. The Company has used derivative instruments, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, to manage certain foreign currency exposure, and interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure.  



By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. The Company enters into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions, for which no collateral is required. The Company has policies to monitor the credit risk of these counterparties. While there can be no assurance, the Company does not anticipate any material 



non-performance by any of these counterparties. 



Interest Rate Swap Agreements 



On September 30, 2016,  



the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix the rate on approximately 



50% of its then-outstanding balance under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, as described further in Note 11. This hedge fixes the interest rate paid on the hedged debt at 



1.198% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 



1.75% as of September 30, 2019, through 





At September 30, 2019, the notional amount of this transaction was

it 



had a fair value asset of $1,180

 and 



it 



had a fair value asset of $6,083

MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.  



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  





On April 3, 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of March 31, 2023, to fix the rate on $300,000 of the then-outstanding balance of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, as described further in Note 11. The rate 



was fixed at 2.309% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 1.75% at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, the notional amount of this transaction was $300,000 and 



it had a fair value liability of $8,088.   



The interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”). To the extent that these arrangements are no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationships is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs.  



Foreign Exchange Contracts 



The Company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency-denominated intercompany sales of inventory, over a maximum period of eighteen months, using forward foreign exchange contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges related to Japanese, South Korean, British, Euro and Taiwanese currencies. To the extent these derivatives are effective in 



off-setting the variability of the hedged cash flows, and otherwise meet the hedge accounting criteria, changes in the derivatives’ fair value are not included in current earnings but are included in OCI in stockholders’ equity. These changes in fair value will subsequently be reclassified into earnings, as applicable, when the forecasted transaction occurs. To the extent that a previously designated hedging transaction is no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs. The cash flows resulting from forward exchange contracts are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows as part of cash flows from operating activities. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes



. 



As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with gross notional values of $142,789 and $159,394, respectively.

Acquisitions 



Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. 



On February 1, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (“ESI”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 29, 2018 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, EAS Equipment, Inc., formerly a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and ESI (the “ESI Merger”). At the effective time of the ESI Merger and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each share of ESI’s common stock that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger was converted into the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without interest and subject to deduction of any required withholding tax. 



The aggregate consideration was $1,032,671, which excludes related transaction fees and expenses, and 



non-cash consideration related to the exchange of share-based awards of $30,630, for a total purchase consideration of $1,063,301. The Company funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of the Company’s available cash on hand and the proceeds from the Company’s senior secured term loan facility described in Note 11.











Represents the vested but not issued portion of ESI share-based compensation awards as of the acquisition date of February 1, 2019.   



Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated acquisition consideration is allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities of ESI based on their fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. The Company expects that none of such goodwill and intangible assets will be deductible for tax purposes.

During the 



second quarter of



 2019, the Company recorded an increase in fair value of approximately $12,600 to property, plant and equipment, based upon the final valuation for land and three ESI facilities located in Portland, Oregon. The Company also recorded a reduction in fair value of approximately $9,800 to inventories relating to three product lines. These adjustments also resulted in an adjustment to intangible assets of $2,400 and goodwill of $1,300 and the related impact to the deferred tax line items. 



The fair value 



write-up of acquired finished goods inventory was $7,624, the amount of which will be expensed over the period during which the acquired inventory is sold. 



For the 



nine months ended 



September 30, 2019, the Company recorded $7,624 



of incremental cost of sales charges associated with the fair value 



write-up of inventory acquired in the ESI Merger.   



The fair value 



of acquired property, plant and equipment of $39,267



 will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable assets, excluding the fair value 



write-up



 in the value of land. Property, plant and equipment is valued at its 



value-in-use,



 unless there was a known plan to dispose of the asset.



The acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the economic use of the asset. 







While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to value the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date, its estimates and assumptions are subject to refinement. 



The net fair value of the acquired intangibles was determined using the income approach. In performing these valuations, the key underlying probability-adjusted assumptions of the discounted cash flows were projected revenues, gross margin expectations and operating cost estimates.



 Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Company’s results of operations. The finalization of the purchase accounting assessment will result in a change in the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and may have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill to reflect additional information received about facts and circumstances which existed at the date of acquisition. The Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed subsequent to the purchase price allocation period in the



MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. 



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 





Company’s operating results in the period in which the adjustments are determined. The size and breadth of the ESI Merger will necessitate the use of this measurement period to adequately analyze and assess a number of the factors used in establishing the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and the related tax impacts of any changes made. Any potential adjustments made could be material in relation to the preliminary values presented above.



The Company believes the amount of goodwill relative to identifiable intangible assets relates to several factors, including broadening its position in key industrial end markets to complementary solutions, and leveraging component and systems expertise to provide robust solutions to meet customer evolving technology needs. 





Certain executives from ESI had severance provisions in their respective ESI employment agreements. The agreements included terms that were accounted for as dual-trigger arrangements. Through the Company’s acquisition accounting, the expense relating to these benefits was recognized in the combined entity’s financial statements. The Company recorded costs of $2,701 and $14,023 in acquisition and integration costs as compensation expense and stock-based compensation expense, respectively, for the nine months ended 



September 30, 2019 associated with these severance provisions. The restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights that were eligible for accelerated vesting if the executive exercised his or her rights but were not issued as of each reporting 



period-end, were excluded from the computation of basic earnings per share and included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for such reporting period.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets    



Goodwill  



The Company’s methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established and generally accepted valuation techniques. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed. The Company assigns assets acquired (including goodwill) and liabilities assumed to one or more reporting units as of the date of acquisition. Typically acquisitions relate to a single reporting unit and thus do not require the allocation of goodwill to multiple reporting units. If the products obtained in an acquisition are assigned to multiple reporting units, the goodwill is distributed to the respective reporting units as part of the purchase price allocation process.  



Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment. The Company regularly monitors current business conditions and other factors including, but not limited to, adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions and lower projections of profitability that may impact future operating results.  











During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded $471,727 of goodwill related to the ESI Merger.

Debt   



Term Loan Credit Agreement  



In connection with the completion of the acquisition of Newport Corporation (“Newport”) in 2016 (the “Newport Merger”), the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders from time to time party thereto (the “Lenders”), that provided senior secured financing in the original principal amount of $780,000 (the “2016 Term Loan Facility”), subject to increase at the Company’s option and subject to receipt of lender commitments in accordance with the Credit Agreement (the 2016 Term Loan Facility, together with the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility 



and 2019 Term Loan Refinancing Facility (each as defined below),

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  





the “Term Loan Facility”). 



Prior to the effectiveness of Amendment No. 6 (as defined below), the 2016 Term Loan Facility 



had a maturity date of April 29, 2023. 





The Wall Street Journal, (3) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00%, and (4) a floor of 1.75%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin; or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a LIBOR rate floor of 0.0%, plus an applicable margin. The Company has elected the interest rate as described in clause (b). The Credit Agreement provides that, unless an alternate rate of interest is agreed, all loans will be determined by reference to the 



base 



rate if the LIBOR rate cannot be ascertained, if regulators impose material restrictions on the authority of a lender to make LIBOR rate loans, or for other reasons. The 2016 Term Loan Facility was issued with original issue discount of 1.00% of the principal amount thereof. 



The Company subsequently entered into 



four separate repricing amendments to the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which decreased the applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings from 4.0% to 1.75%, with a LIBOR rate floor of 0.75%. As a consequence of the pricing of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility (defined below), the applicable margin for the 2016 Term Loan Facility was increased to 2.00% (from 1.75%) with respect to LIBOR borrowings and 1.00% (from 0.75%) with respect to base rate borrowings. 



On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of 



September 30, 2020, to fix the rate on $335,000 of the then-outstanding balance of the 2016 Term Loan Facility. The rate 



was fixed at 1.198% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 



1.75% at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, the notional amount of this transaction was $250,000 and 



it had a fair value asset of $1,180.     



The Company incurred $28,747 of deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method.



On February 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the ESI Merger, the Company entered into an amendment (“Amendment No. 5”) to the Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 5 provided an additional tranche 



B-5 term loan commitment in the 



original principal amount of $650,000 (the “2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility”), all of which was drawn down in connection with the closing of the ESI Merger. Pursuant to Amendment No. 5, the Company also effectuated certain amendments to the Credit Agreement which make certain of the negative covenants and other provisions less restrictive. Prior to the effectiveness of Amendment No. 6 (as defined below), the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility had a maturity date of February 1, 2026 and bore interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, a base rate or LIBOR rate (as described above) plus, in each case, an applicable margin equal to 1.25% with respect to base rate borrowings and 2.25% with respect to LIBOR borrowings. The 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility was issued with original issue discount of 1.00% of the principal amount thereof. 



On April 3, 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of March 31, 2023, to fix the rate on $300,000 of the then-outstanding balance of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility. The rate 



was fixed at 2.309% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 1.75% at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, the notional amount of this transaction was $300,000 and 



it had a fair value liability of $8,088.  



The Company incurred $11,362 of deferred finance fees and original issue discount fees related to the term loans under the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method. 



On September 27, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment (“Amendment No. 6”) to the Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 6 refinanced all existing loans outstanding under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility (“Existing Term Loans”) for a tranche 





 term loan commitment in the original principal amount of $896,839 (“2019 Term Loan Refinancing Facility”). Each lender of the Existing Term Loans who elected to participate in the 2019 Term Loan Refinancing Facility was deemed to have exchanged the aggregate outstanding principal amount of its Existing Term Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement for an equal aggregate principal amount of tranche





term loans under the 2019 Term Loan Refinancing Facility. On the effective date of Amendment No. 6 and immediately prior to the exchanges described above, the Company made a voluntary prepayment of $50,000, which was applied to 



the Existing Term Loans on a pro rata basis.

Commencing with the completion of the first fiscal quarter ending after the closing of the ABL Facility, the applicable margin for borrowings thereunder is subject to upward or downward adjustment each fiscal quarter, based on the average historical excess availability during the preceding quarter. 



In addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal under the ABL Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder equal to 0.25% per annum. The Company must also pay customary letter of credit fees and agency fees. 



The Company incurred $785 of costs in connection with the ABL Facility, which were capitalized and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of five years of the ABL Facility. As a result of a prior asset-based facility being terminated concurrently with our entry into the ABL Facility, the Company wrote off $216 of previously capitalized debt issuance costs.  



The ABL Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the ABL Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the ABL Facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. The Company has not borrowed against this ABL Facility to date.  



Lines of Credit and Short-Term Borrowing Arrangements 



One of the Company’s Japanese subsidiaries has lines of credit and short-term borrowing arrangements with two financial institutions, which arrangements generally expire and are renewed at three-month intervals. The lines of credit provided for aggregate borrowings as of September 30, 2019 of up to an equivalent of $21,308. One of the borrowing arrangements has an interest rate based on the Tokyo Interbank Offer Rate at the time of borrowing and the other has an interest rate based on the Japanese Short-Term Prime Lending Rate. There were no borrowings outstanding under these arrangements at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.  



The Company has various revolving lines of credit and a financing facility. These revolving lines of credit and financing facility have no expiration date and as of September 30, 2019, provided for aggregate borrowings of up to an equivalent of $11,581.

Product Warranties



The Company records the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by shipment volume, product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, and supplier warranties on parts delivered to the Company. Should actual product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, or supplier warranties on parts differ from the Company’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.











Income Taxes



The Company’s effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were 14.4% and 20.4%, 



respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, and related income tax expense, were lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate due to the deduction for foreign derived intangible income, the geographic mix of income earned by the Company’s international subsidiaries being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate and the impact of various tax credits, offset by the tax effects of the global intangible 



low-taxed income inclusion along with the correction of an 



out-of-period  error with respect to deferred tax assets related to limitations on the deduction of executive compensation in the amount of $5,023. This correction, which was recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2019, but should have been recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2018, increased the Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019 by 9.8%, 7.5% and





, respectively. The error and subsequent 



adjus



tment were not material to prior or current interim and annual financial statements. 



The Company’s effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were 18.5% and 17.6%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, and related income tax expense, were lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate mainly due to the geographic mix of income earned by the Company’s international subsidiaries being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate, windfall benefits of stock compensation, and the deduction for foreign derived intangible income



, offset by the tax effects of the global intangible low



-taxed income inclusion and state income taxes.



As of September 30, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $41,170. At December 31, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $32,684. The net increase was primarily attributable to the addition of historical gross unrecognized tax benefits for ESI as a result of the ESI Merger during the quarter ended March 31, 2019. As of 





MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. 



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 





September 30, 2019, if these benefits were recognized in a future period, the timing of which is not estimable, the net unrecognized tax benefit of $33,415, excluding interest and penalties, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company accrues interest expense, and if applicable, penalties, for any uncertain tax positions. Interest and penalties are classified as a component of income tax expense. As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $581 and $568, respectively.



Over the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that the Company may recognize approximately $1,225 of previously net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, related to various U.S. federal, state and foreign tax positions primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service commenced an examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax filings for tax years 2015 and 2016 during the quarter ended September 30, 2017. This audit was effectively settled during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and the impact was not material. Also during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 the Company received notification from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service of their intent to audit its U.S. subsidiary, Newport, for tax year 2015. This audit commenced during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and was effectively settled during the quarter ended June 30, 2019 with a no change result. The U.S. statute of limitations remains open for tax years 2016 through present. The statute of limitations for the Company’s tax filings in other jurisdictions varies between fiscal years 2013 through present. The Company also has certain federal credit carry-forwards and state tax loss and credit carry-forwards that are open to examination for tax years 2000 through the present.





Net Income Per Share





Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding (using the treasury stock method) if securities containing potentially dilutive common shares (restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock appreciation rights (“SARs”)) had been converted to such common shares, and if such assumed conversion is dilutive. 



For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, there were approximately 





165,000 weighted-average RSUs, respectively, that would have had an anti-dilutive effect on EPS, and would thus need to be excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares. 



For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, there were approximately 





68,800 weighted-average RSUs, respectively, that would have had an anti-dilutive effect on EPS, and would thus need to be excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares.

Stock-Based Compensation



The Company grants 



RSUs



 to employees and directors under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”). The 2014 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. The 2014 Plan is intended to attract and retain employees and directors, and to provide an incentive for these individuals to assist the Company to achieve long-range performance goals and to enable these individuals to participate in the long-term growth of the 



Company.

SAR



s



 were converted automatically into 



SARs



 with respect to 12,787 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Assumed SARs”). 



Included in the total number of assumed RSUs are 326,283 shares of the Company’s common stock for employees and outside directors that are part of the ESI Deferred Compensation plan (the “ESI DC Plan”). These shares will not become issued shares until their respective release dates. 



The shares of the Company’s common stock that are subject to the Assumed SARs and the Assumed RSUs are issuable pursuant to the Company’s 2014 Plan. 



The 748,920 shares of the Company’s common stock that are issuable pursuant to the Assumed RSUs and the Assumed SARs under the Company’s 2014 Plan were registered under the Securities Act of 1933 on the Registration Statement on Form

During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company granted 417,335 RSUs with a weighted average grant date fair value of $86.18. During the nine months ended 



September



 30, 2018, the Company granted 260,341 RSUs with a weighted average grant date fair value of $112.49. There were no SARs granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 or 2018. 







At September 30, 2019, the total compensation expense related to unvested stock-based awards granted to employees and directors under the 2014 Plan that had not been recognized was $30,795, net of estimated forfeitures. The future compensation expense for time-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis and the future compensation expense for performance-based awards is recognized using the accelerated graded vesting method, both of which expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, except for retirement eligible employees, in which case the Company expenses the fair value of the grant in the period the grant is issued. The Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards and historical experience. Actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from the Company’s current estimates.

Stockholders’ Equity



Share Repurchase Program



On July 25, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $200,000 of its outstanding common stock from time to time in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or through other appropriate means. The timing and quantity of any shares repurchased will depend upon a variety of factors, including business conditions, stock market conditions and business development activities, including, but not limited to, merger and acquisition opportunities. These repurchases may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The Company has repurchased approximately 2,588,000 shares of common stock for approximately $127,000 pursuant to the program since its adoption. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, there were no repurchases of common stock.



During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 818,000 shares of its common stock for $75,000, or an average of $91.67 per share
