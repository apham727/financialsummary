 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 



  Forward-Looking statements. Certain statements contained in this report are not based on historical facts, but are forward-looking statements that are based upon various assumptions about future conditions. Actual events in the future could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking information. Numerous unknown factors and future events could cause such differences, including but not limited to, product demand, market acceptance, success of marketing strategy, success of expansion efforts, impact of competition, adverse economic conditions, and other factors affecting the Company’s business that are beyond the Company’s control, which are discussed elsewhere in this report. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. 



  Overview. The Company reflected a loss before income tax expense of $75,700 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to income before tax expense of $177,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2018, primarily from the result of decreased revenues and gross margins for the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations resulting from reduced orders from Asia, primarily China, and increased component costs as a result of tariffs imposed. In addition, the Company’s Scientific Bioprocessing Operations also reflected decreased income from operations due to the substantial investment in its new product development efforts resulting in increased expenses. The Company’s Catalyst Research Instruments reflected lower income resulting from lower sales. The results reflected total non-cash amounts for depreciation and amortization of $41,000 and $75,900 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 



  Results of Operations. Net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2019 decreased $34,400 (1.7%) to $2,004,200 from $2,038,600 for the three months ended September 30, 2018, reflecting a decrease of $115,700 (6.8%) decrease in net sales of Benchtop Laboratory Equipment primarily due to sales of its Genie brand products to Asia, particularly China. The Benchtop Laboratory Equipment sales reflected $522,400 of Torbal brand product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to $425,300 in the three months ended September 30, 2018 as a result of continued growth in sales of the new force gauges product line. Sales of Catalyst Research Instruments decreased by $78,800 to $138,700 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $217,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 due to low order input during the period. As of September 30, 2019, the order backlog for Catalyst Research Instruments was $173,500, all of which is expected to be shipped during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, compared to $329,400 as of September 30, 2018. Revenues derived from the Bioprocessing Systems Operations which are comprised primarily of net royalties accrued from sublicenses increased by $160,100 (123.9%) to $289,300 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $129,200 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 due to increased royalties on Europe sales. 



 The gross profit percentage on a combined basis was 48.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 46.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2018. However, gross margins for the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations were affected by higher component costs impacted by tariffs and the gross profit percentage for the Catalyst Research Instruments was lower due to decreased sales during the period and high overhead. 



 General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased by $93,700 (22.5%) to $510,200 compared to $416,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 mainly due to the ramp up in Scientific Bioprocessing Operations, and various other corporate expenses. 



 Selling expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased $73,000 (30.9%) to $309,100 from $236,100 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to increased market research and marketing activities by the Bioprocessing Systems Operations, and to a lesser extent increased marketing by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations. 



 Research and development expenses increased by $119,200 (101.5%) to $236,600 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $117,400 for the three months ended September 30, 2018, mainly due to the ramp up in product development activities by the Bioprocessing Systems Operations which included staffing and materials. 



 The Company reflected an income tax benefit of $19,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to an income tax expense of $35,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to the loss generated during the three months ended September 30, 2019. 



 As a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded a net loss of $56,200 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to net income of $142,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2018. 



  Liquidity and Capital Resources. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $342,800 to $1,259,700 as of September 30, 2019 from $1,602,500 as of June 30, 2019. 



  Net cash used in operating activities was $324,100 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $460,700 during the three months ended September 30, 2018, primarily as a result of the loss incurred for the current year period. Net cash used in investing activities was $25,700 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $4,900 used during the three months ended September 30, 2018 principally due to new capital equipment purchased during the current period by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations. The Company received proceeds of $7,000 in financing activities in the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to a loss of $1,600 in the three months ended September 30, 2018 due to the exercise of stock options in the current year. 





  The Company's working capital decreased by $203,500 to $4,802,300 as of September 30, 2019 compared to $5,005,800, as of June 30, 2019 due to the loss generated during the period. 



  The Company has a Demand Line of Credit through December 2019 with First National Bank of Pennsylvania which provides for borrowings of up to $300,000 for regular working capital needs, bearing interest at prime, currently 4.75%. Advances on the line, are secured by a pledge of the Company’s assets including inventory, accounts, chattel paper, equipment and general intangibles of the Company. As of September 30, 2019 no borrowings were outstanding under such line. 



  Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its cash flow needs during the 12 months ending September 30, 2020 from its available financial resources including the lines of credit, its cash and investment securities, and operations. Commencing in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company began committing significant resources for the Bioprocessing Systems Operations for new engineering personnel, market research, materials, supplies, and administration, and expects to continue to grow this business segment which will require substantial cash outlays. 





  Item 4. Controls and Procedures
