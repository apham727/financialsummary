ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (“Maxim Integrated” or the “Company” and also referred to as “we,” “our” or “us”) disclaims any duty to and undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information relating to existing conditions, future events or otherwise or to release publicly the results of any future revisions it may make to forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by federal securities laws. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Readers should carefully review future reports and documents that the Company files with or furnishes to the SEC from time to time, such as its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and any Current Reports on Form 8-K.



Overview of Business



Maxim Integrated is incorporated in the state of Delaware. Maxim Integrated designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of linear and mixed-signal integrated circuits, commonly referred to as analog circuits, for a large number of geographically diverse customers. We also provide a range of high-frequency process technologies and capabilities that can be used in custom designs. The analog market is fragmented and characterized by many diverse applications, a great number of product variations and, with respect to many circuit types, relatively long product life cycles. We are a global company with a wafer manufacturing facility in the U.S., testing facilities in the Philippines and Thailand, and sales and circuit design offices around the world. We also utilize third party foundries for manufacturing of our products. The major end-markets in which our products are sold are the Automotive, Communications and Data Center, Computing, Consumer and Industrial markets.



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES



The methods, estimates, and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require us to make our most difficult and subjective accounting judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of net revenues; valuation of inventories, which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins; the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts impairment of long-lived assets; assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill, which impacts impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; accounting for income taxes, which 





impacts the income tax provision; and assessment of litigation and contingencies, which impacts charges recorded in cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses and income taxes. These policies and the estimates and judgments involved are discussed further in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We have other significant accounting policies that either do not generally require estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective, or it is less likely that such accounting policies would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period. 



Except for the accounting policies and estimates outlined under Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 2, there have been no material changes during the six months ended December 29, 2018 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. 





RESULTS OF OPERATIONS











Net Revenues



Net revenues were $576.9 million and $622.6 million for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively. Revenue from industrial products are down by 14%, mainly due to a decline in shipments of control and automation products. Revenue from communications and data center products are down by 20%, due to generally lower shipments of server, basestation and data center products. Revenue from automotive products are up by 3%, driven by higher demand for auto powertrain, and auto safety and security products. In addition, the decrease in revenue was partially driven by a one-time incremental $22.0 million of revenue recognized as a result of the sell-in accounting revenue transition during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Also, the decrease in revenue was partially driven by the 13-week second quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to the 14-week second quarter of fiscal year 2018. 



Net revenues were $1,215.4 million and $1,198.3 million for the six months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively. Revenue from automotive products are up by 8%, driven by higher demand for auto powertrain, and auto safety and security products. Revenue from consumer products are up by 7%, driven by an overall higher demand for cell phones, handheld computers, and wearable consumer products. Revenue from communications and data center products are down by 7% due to generally lower shipments of server and basestation products. 





During the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, approximately 89% and 87% of net revenues, respectively, were derived from customers outside of the United States. While less than 1.0% of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate our risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue and results of operations for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 was immaterial.



Gross Margin 



Our gross margin percentages were 64.7% and 65.8% for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively. Our gross margin decreased by 1.1 percentage points, due to higher inventory reserves. 



Our gross margin percentages were 66.1% and 65.4% for the six months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively. Our gross margin increased by 0.7 percentage points, due to lower intangible amortization, and certain one-time events, partially offset by higher inventory reserves.



Research and Development



Research and development expenses were $110.3 million and $115.9 million for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively, which represented 19.1% and 18.6% of net revenues for each respective period. The $5.6 million decrease was due to lower salaries and related personnel expenses. 



Research and development expenses were $223.0 million and $224.5 million for the six months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively, which represented 18.3% and 18.7% of net revenues for each respective period. The $1.5 million decrease was due to lower salaries and related personnel expenses.



Selling, General and Administrative



Selling, general and administrative expenses were $77.9 million and $85.3 million for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively, which represented 13.5% and 13.7% of net revenues for each respective period. The $7.5 million decrease was due to lower salaries and related personnel expenses, as well as lower legal expenses.



Selling, general and administrative expenses were $159.4 million and $159.0 million for the six months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively, which represented 13.1% and 13.3% of net revenues for each respective period. Selling, general and administrative expenses remained roughly flat year-over-year.



Severance and Restructuring Expenses



Severance and restructuring expenses were $1.2 million and $6.5 million for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively, which represented 0.2% and 1.0% of net revenues for each respective period. The $5.3 million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in restructuring activities.



Severance and restructuring expenses were $2.2 million and $12.0 million for the six months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively, which represented 0.2% and 1.0% of net revenues for each respective period. The $9.8 million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in restructuring activities.



Provision for Income Taxes 



In the three and six months ended December 29, 2018, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $50.8 million and $87.0 million, respectively, compared to $272.9 million and $299.4 million for the three and six months ended December 30, 2017, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 29, 2018 was 27.8% and 20.9%, respectively, compared to 137.9% and 79.0% for the three and six months ended December 30, 2017, respectively.



On December 22, 2017 legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), was enacted. The Act included a one-time tax on accumulated unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”). SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 allowed the use of provisional amounts (reasonable estimates) if accounting for the income tax effects of the Act was not completed. Provisional amounts must be adjusted within a one-year measurement period from the enactment date of the Act. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company recorded a discrete $236.9 million provisional Transition Tax charge. During the measurement period the Company gathered additional information and analyzed available guidance to more precisely compute 





the amount of the Transition Tax. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, the Company completed this work and recorded a discrete $22.1 million measurement period adjustment for the Transition Tax, which increased the Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 29, 2018 by 12.1% and 5.3%, respectively. As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, the accounting for income tax effects of the Act has been completed.



The Act reduced the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in a fiscal year 2018 federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for the Company (average of a 35% rate for the first half of fiscal year 2018 and a 21% rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018). The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 21%. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company recorded a $13.7 million discrete charge to remeasure deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the enactment date of the Act to reflect the federal statutory tax rate reductions.



The Act included Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions, which impact the Company in fiscal year 2019. The GILTI provisions effectively subject income earned by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries to current U.S. tax at a rate of 10.5%, less foreign tax credits. Under U.S. GAAP the Company can make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to impact GILTI in future years or provide for tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense. The Company has elected to treat tax generated by the GILTI provisions as a period expense.



The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 21%. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended December 29, 2018 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to a $22.1 million discrete charge for the Transition Tax, tax generated by the GILTI provisions, and a $4.9 million discrete charge for interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates.



The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended December 29, 2018 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, partially offset by a $22.1 million discrete charge for the Transition Tax, tax generated by the GILTI provisions, and a $9.4 million discrete charge for interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits.



The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was 28.1%. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 30, 2017 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to a $236.9 million discrete provisional charge for the Transition Tax, a $13.7 million discrete charge to remeasure deferred taxes as of the enactment date of the Act, $4.2 million and $8.0 million discrete charges for interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits in the three and six months ended December 30, 2017, respectively, partially offset by earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates.



BACKLOG



At December 29, 2018 and June 30, 2018, our current quarter backlog was approximately $372.3 million and $441.1 million, respectively. In backlog, we include orders with customer request dates within the next three months. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, these orders may be canceled in most cases without penalty to customers. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog is not a reliable measure of future revenues. All backlog numbers have been adjusted for estimated future distribution ship and debit pricing adjustments.



FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



Financial Condition









Operating activities



Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.



Cash provided by operating activities was $431.4 million in the six months ended December 29, 2018, a decrease of $18.1 million compared with the six months ended December 30, 2017. This decrease was due to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher net income. 



Investing activities



Investing cash flows consist primarily of net investment purchases and maturities, and capital expenditures. 



Cash provided by investing activities was $496.5 million for the six months ended December 29, 2018, compared with cash used by investing activities of $731.2 million for the six months ended December 30, 2017, a change of $1,227.6 million. The change was due to lower purchases of and higher proceeds from maturity of available-for-sale securities, in order to provide funds to repay the November 2018 Notes. 



Financing activities



Financing cash flows consist primarily of debt issuance, repurchases of common stock, and payment of dividends to stockholders.



Net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately $731.6 million for the six months ended December 29, 2018 compared to the six months ended December 30, 2017. The increase was due to the repayment of the November 2018 Notes and repurchases of our common stock. 



Liquidity and Capital Resources



As of December 29, 2018, our available funds consisted of $2.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements, including the anticipated level of capital expenditures, common stock repurchases, debt repayments and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months.



Available Borrowing Resources



We have access to a $350 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on June 27, 2019. As of December 29, 2018, we had not borrowed any amounts from this credit facility. Effective January 22, 2019, the Company terminated this revolving credit facility. 



Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements



As of December 29, 2018, we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.



ITEM 2: UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS



On July 20, 2017, the board of directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock. The stock repurchase authorization did not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity depended on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors. The Company's prior repurchase authorization was cancelled and superseded by this repurchase authorization.



On October 30, 2018, the board of directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of the Company’s common stock. This stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors. The Company’s prior repurchase authorization was cancelled and superseded by this new repurchase authorization.







In the fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 4.0 million shares of its common stock for approximately $207.6 million. As of December 29, 2018, the Company had remaining authorization of $1.3 billion for future share repurchases. The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors, including the price of the Company’s common stock and general market and business conditions.
