ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (“Maxim Integrated” or the “Company” and also referred to as “we,” “our” or “us”) disclaims any duty to and undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information relating to existing conditions, future events or otherwise or to release publicly the results of any future revisions it may make to forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by federal securities laws. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Readers should carefully review future reports and documents that the Company files with or furnishes to the SEC from time to time, such as its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and any Current Reports on Form 8-K.



Overview of Business



Maxim Integrated is incorporated in the state of Delaware. Maxim Integrated designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of linear and mixed-signal integrated circuits, commonly referred to as analog circuits, for a large number of geographically diverse customers. We also provide a range of high-frequency process technologies and capabilities that can be used in custom designs. The analog market is fragmented and characterized by many diverse applications, a great number of product variations and, with respect to many circuit types, relatively long product life cycles. We are a global company with a wafer manufacturing facility in the U.S., testing facilities in the Philippines and Thailand, and sales and circuit design offices around the world. We also utilize third party foundries for manufacturing of our products. The major end-markets in which our products are sold are the Automotive, Communications and Data Center, Computing, Consumer and Industrial markets. 



During fiscal year 2015, we commenced activities to close down the operations in our Hillsboro, Oregon testing site and consolidate such operations with our facility in Beaverton, Oregon, which were completed in fiscal year 2017.



During fiscal year 2016, we commenced activities to close our wafer level packaging ("WLP") manufacturing facility in Dallas, Texas. We completed the sale of our Dallas, Texas campus, including our WLP manufacturing facility, in fiscal year 2016. We completed the transition of design, administration and manufacturing activities and discontinued our operations in the WLP manufacturing facility in fiscal year 2017.



During fiscal year 2017, we completed the sale of our micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) business line, including related assets and inventory, for approximately $42.2 million.



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES





The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require us to make our most difficult and subjective accounting judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of net revenues; valuation of inventories, which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins; the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts impairment of long-lived assets; assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill, which impacts impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; accounting for income taxes, which impacts the income tax provision; and assessment of litigation and contingencies, which impacts charges recorded in cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses and income taxes. These policies and the estimates and judgments involved are discussed further in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 24, 2017. We have other significant accounting policies that either do not generally require estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective, or it is less likely that such accounting policies would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period. 



There have been no material changes during the nine months ended March 31, 2018 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 24, 2017. 





RESULTS OF OPERATIONS











Net Revenues



Net revenues were $648.6 million and $581.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively. Revenue from consumer products was up 31%, primarily due to higher shipments of products for smartphones. Revenue from automotive products was up 10%, primarily driven by growth in infotainment. Revenue from industrial products was also up 7%, driven by higher sales of control and automation products and other industrial products. 



Net revenues were $1,846.9 million and $1,693.6 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively. Revenue from automotive products was up 16%, primarily driven by growth in infotainment. Revenue from industrial products was up 15%, driven by higher sales of control and automation products and other industrial products. Revenue from consumer products was also up 5%, primarily due to higher shipments of products for smartphones. The increase in revenue was also partially driven by the 14-week second quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to the 13-week second quarter of fiscal year 2017. 





During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, approximately 88% and 89% of net revenues, respectively, were derived from customers outside of the United States. While less than 1.0% of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate our risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue and results of operations for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017 was immaterial.



Gross Margin 



Our gross margin percentages were 65.4% and 63.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively. Our gross margin increased by 2.3 percentage points, primarily due to implementation of cost reduction initiatives and improved factory utilization.



Our gross margin percentages were 65.4% and 62.2% for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively. Our gross margin increased by 3.2 percentage points, primarily due to implementation of cost reduction initiatives and improved factory utilization.



Research and Development



Research and development expenses were $114.4 million and $113.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively, which represented 17.6% and 19.4% of net revenues for each respective period. The $1.2 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and related expenses.



Research and development expenses were $338.9 million and $340.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively, which represented 18.3% and 20.1% of net revenues for each respective period. The $1.1 million decrease was primarily due to continued management of research and development programs.



Selling, General and Administrative



Selling, general and administrative expenses were $81.3 million and $74.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively, which represented 12.5% and 12.7% of net revenues for each respective period. The $7.3 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and related expenses.



Selling, general and administrative expenses were $240.3 million and $216.4 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively, which represented 13.0% and 12.8% of net revenues for each respective period. The $23.9 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and related expenses.



Severance and Restructuring Expenses



Severance and restructuring expenses were $2.3 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively, which represented 0.4% and 0.1% of net revenues for each respective period. The $1.8 million increase was primarily due to employee enrollments in voluntary separation programs during fiscal year 2018.



Severance and restructuring expenses were $14.2 million and $11.3 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively, which represented 0.8% and 0.7% of net revenues for each respective period. The $2.9 million increase was primarily due to employee enrollments in voluntary separation programs during fiscal year 2018.



Other Operating Expenses (Income), net



Other operating expenses (income), net were $0.3 million and $1.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively, which represented less than 0.1% and 0.3% of net revenues for each respective period. This net decrease in other operating expense of $1.4 million was primarily driven by losses on the sale of fixed assets during the three months ended March 25, 2017.



Other operating expenses (income), net were $(1.5) million and $(24.9) million during the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively, which represented 0.1% and 1.5% of net revenues for each respective period. This net decrease in other operating income of $23.4 million was primarily driven by the $26.6 million gain on the sale of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) business line in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.



Provision for Income Taxes 





On December 22, 2017 legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), was enacted. The primary impact of the Act in fiscal year 2018 is a reduction of our federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 28.1% (average of a 35% rate for the first half of fiscal year 2018 and a 21% rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018) and taxation of the higher of the accumulated unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of November 2, 2017 or December 31, 2017 (“Repatriation Tax”). Accumulated unremitted earnings are taxed at a rate of 15.5% to the extent of the aggregate foreign cash position of our foreign subsidiaries and a rate of 8% to the extent that accumulated unremitted earnings exceeds the aggregate foreign cash position. The Act allows us to elect to pay the Repatriation Tax in eight annual interest free installments beginning in September 2018, although for accounting purposes the entire tax was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Act has other provisions that will significantly impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019, including a further reduction of the federal statutory tax rate to 21% and provisions that impact taxation of our international earnings. We are still considering the impact of these provisions on our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 and future years.



Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 allowed the use of provisional amounts (reasonable estimates) if accounting for the income tax effects of the Act were not completed when our financial statements for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 were issued. Provisional amounts must be adjusted during the measurement period as accounting for the income tax effects of the Act is completed. The measurement period began on December 22, 2017, the enactment date of the Act, and lasts no longer than one year.



In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we recorded a $236.9 million discrete provisional charge for the Repatriation Tax and a $13.7 million discrete charge to remeasure deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the enactment date of the Act to reflect the federal statutory tax rate reduction. To determine the amount of the Repatriation Tax, we must determine the accumulated unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and the amount of foreign income tax paid on such earnings. We made a reasonable estimate of the Repatriation Tax and therefore recorded a provisional Repatriation Tax charge of $236.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. No adjustment to the provisional Repatriation Tax charge was made in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 as we continue to gather information and analyze the available guidance to more precisely compute the amount of the Repatriation Tax.



In the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, we recorded an income tax provision of $28.7 million and $328.0 million, respectively, compared to $30.2 million and $75.7 million for the three and nine months ended March 25, 2017, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 was 12.9% and 54.6%, respectively, compared to 17.7% and 15.6% for the three and nine months ended March 25, 2017, respectively.



Our federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2018 is 28.1%. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by our international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and $4.6 million of discrete excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards, partially offset by $5.1 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits. 



Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to a $236.9 million discrete provisional charge for the Repatriation Tax, a $13.7 million discrete charge to remeasure deferred taxes as of the enactment date of the Act, and $13.1 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by our international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and $8.3 million of discrete excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards.



Our federal statutory tax rate for the fiscal year 2017 was 35%. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended March 25, 2017 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by our international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and $4.3 million and $9.5 million of discrete excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards in the three and nine months ended March 25, 2017, respectively, partially offset by stock-based compensation for which no tax benefit is expected and $3.6 million and $10.4 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits in the three and nine months ended March 25, 2017, respectively.



BACKLOG



At March 31, 2018 and June 24, 2017, our current quarter backlog was approximately $436.0 million and $389.1 million, respectively. In backlog, we include orders with customer request dates within the next three months. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, these orders may be canceled in most cases without penalty to customers. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog is not a reliable measure of future revenues. All backlog numbers have been adjusted for estimated future distribution ship and debit pricing adjustments.





FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



Financial Condition







Operating activities



Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.



Cash provided by operating activities was $672.8 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $136.1 million compared with the nine months ended March 25, 2017. This increase was due primarily to an increase of $117.2 million in income before provision for income taxes, which resulted from higher revenue and improved gross margin. 



Investing activities



Investing cash flows consist primarily of net investment purchases and maturities and capital expenditures.



Cash used in investing activities increased by $388.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared with the nine months ended March 25, 2017. The increase was due primarily to a $722.0 million increase in purchases of available-for-sale-securities, partially offset by $397.5 million increase in proceeds from maturity of available-for-sale securities during the nine months ended March 31, 2018.



Financing activities



Financing cash flows consist primarily of debt issuance, repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends to stockholders.



Net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately $84.7 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the nine months ended March 25, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a $250.0 million repayment of notes payable during the nine months ended March 25, 2017 with no repayment for the nine months ended March 31, 2018. This was partially offset by $104.0 million in higher repurchases of our common stock and a $40.2 million increase in dividends paid to stockholders during the nine months ended March 31, 2018.



Liquidity and Capital Resources



As of March 31, 2018, our available funds consisted of $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements, including the anticipated level of capital expenditures, common stock repurchases, debt repayments and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months.



Outstanding Debt Levels



On June 15, 2017, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.45% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due on June 15, 2027 (“2027 Notes”).



On November 21, 2013, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.5% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due on November 15, 2018 (“2018 Notes”).



On March 18, 2013, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.375% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due on March 15, 2023 (“2023 Notes”).





The estimated fair value of outstanding long-term debt is $1,485 million and $1,516 million as of March 31, 2018 and June 24, 2017, respectively.



Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements



As of March 31, 2018, we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.



ITEM 2: UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS



On July 20, 2017, the board of directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock. The stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors. The Company's prior repurchase authorization was cancelled and superseded by this new repurchase authorization.







In the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of its common stock for approximately $127.7 million. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had remaining authorization of $746.4 million for future share repurchases. The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors, including the price of the Company’s common stock and general market and business conditions.
