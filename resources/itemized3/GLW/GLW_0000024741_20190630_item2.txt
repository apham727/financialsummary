OVERVIEW



Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework and recently introduced Strategy and Growth Framework



In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value. The Framework outlined our leadership priorities and articulated the opportunities we saw across our businesses. We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength. Under the Framework, we targeted generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth. As of June 30, 2019, Corning met its goal of returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and is on track to invest $11 billion for growth and extended leadership.



On June 14, 2019, Corning introduced its 2020-2023 Strategy and Growth Framework. From 2020 to 2023, the company plans to invest $10 billion to $12 billion for growth and to return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders.

Summary of results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019



Net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $2,940 million and $5,752 million, compared to $2,747 million and $5,247 million, respectively, during the same periods in 2018. Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased $67 million and $245 million, respectively. Growth from multi-year hyperscale data center projects drove the increase in enterprise sales in both periods. Sales in carrier networks were down in the three months and up in the six months ended June 30, 2019. Increased sales of fiber were more than offset by a decrease in sales of North American fiber-to-the-home during the current quarter. The acquisition of 3M’s Communication Markets Division (“CMD”), which took place during the second quarter of 2018, also contributed to sales growth. Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $68 million and $141 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, with volume increases in the mid-teens in percentage terms more than offsetting moderate price declines.  The Specialty Materials segment net sales increased by $26 million and $57 million, respectively, resulting from higher sales of Gorilla Glass products in both periods and higher sales of Advanced Optics products contributing to year-to-date results. Net sales for Environmental Technologies increased $49 million and $89 million, respectively, driven by sales growth of gas particulate filters and heavy-duty diesel products. Life Sciences sales increased by $15 million and $26 million, respectively. 





Translated earnings losses in the current period of $84 million compared to gains in the prior period of $410 million;



The negative impact of discrete tax and other tax-related items in the amount of $90 million, largely driven by changes to our tax reserves and changes in our foreign valuation allowances for deferred tax assets; 



Translation losses on Japanese yen-denominated debt in the current period compared to gains in the prior period resulting in $57 million of negative change; and



Higher costs of $33 million, primarily accelerated depreciation, within the Display Technologies segment.



The decreases in net income outlined above were offset by higher net income across all operating segments of $62 million driven by higher sales.



Diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.69 per share when compared to the second quarter of 2018, driven by the decrease in net income described, offset by the repurchase of 35.8 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.





Higher net income across all operating segments of $130 million driven by higher sales;



An increase of $181 million in translated earnings contract gains;



The positive impact of discrete tax and other tax-related items in the amount of $126 million, largely driven by the absence of a $172 million IRS audit settlement recorded in the first quarter of 2018 offset by changes to our tax reserves and a release of foreign valuation allowances on deferred tax assets; and



The absence of a $103 million charge related to legal matters, including a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in civil litigation matters recorded in the first quarter of 2018. 



The increases in net income outlined above were offset by other net charges and credits of $20 million, primarily driven by accelerated depreciation within the Display Technologies segment and other corporate charges.



Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.53 per share when compared to the first half of 2018, driven by the increase in net income described above, offset by the repurchase of 35.8 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.



The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.

Index





We believe 2019 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework and recently introduced Strategy and Growth Framework. In our Display Technologies segment, we expect full year 2019 price declines to improve further to a low-to mid-single digit percentage. We anticipate Corning’s display glass volume will grow by high-single digits driven by television screen size growth and the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in Hefei, China. In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase by a low-to-mid-single digit percentage, including the impact of a full year of sales from the acquisition of CMD. We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, the rate of which will depend on the adoption of our innovations. We expect low-teen percentage growth in our Environmental Technologies segment.  We anticipate a mid-single digit percentage growth in sales for the Life Sciences segment.

Index





Display Technologies net sales increased $68 million compared to the prior year, with the increase in glass volume in the mid-teens in percentage terms more than offsetting moderate price declines; 



An increase of $67 million in the Optical Communications segment, due to higher sales of enterprise network products, up $83 million, offset by a sales decrease of $16 million for carrier products. These results include the impact of sales from the acquisition of CMD;



An increase of $26 million in the Specialty Materials segment, primarily driven by higher sales of Gorilla Glass; 



An increase of $49 million in the Environmental Technologies segment, driven primarily by sales growth of gas particulate filters and heavy-duty diesel products; and 



An increase of $15 million in the Life Sciences segment. 



Movements in foreign exchange rates decreased Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $34 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019, when compared to the prior year.





Display Technologies net sales increased $141 million compared to the prior year, with the increase in glass volume in the mid-teens in percentage terms more than offsetting moderate price declines; 



An increase of $245 million in the Optical Communications segment, due to higher sales of enterprise and carrier network products, up $157 million and $88 million, respectively, including the impact of sales from the acquisition of CMD;

Movements in foreign exchange rates decreased Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $59 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019, when compared to the prior year.



Cost of Sales





Gross Margin



In the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, gross margin decreased by $7 million and 1% and increased by $137 million or 7%, respectively. Gross margin was negatively impacted by $75 million and $52 million, respectively, primarily due to increased accelerated depreciation for the Display Technologies segment and capacity expansion in China.



Selling, General and Administrative Expenses



When compared to the second quarter of 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses were similar in the three months ended June 30, 2019. 



When compared to the first half of 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $98 million, or 11%, in the six months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease was due to the absence of a $132 million charge related to legal matters in 2018, including a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in civil litigation matters; partially offset by an increase of $39 million in the Optical Communications segment, driven largely by the acquisition of CMD in June 2018.



Selling, general and administrative expenses remained constant as a percentage of sales at 14% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.

Research, Development and Engineering Expenses 



For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $6 million, or 2%, and $14 million, or 3%, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year, driven by higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses. As a percentage of sales, these expenses decreased by 1% and remained constant, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year. 



Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies







Equity in earnings of affiliated companies for the six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased by $12 million, driven primarily by the absence of a gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018 resulting from a legal settlement.

Income Before Income Taxes



The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated income before income taxes in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.



Provision for Income Taxes 







For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to additional net tax expense of $86 million driven by changes to our tax reserves, rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies, estimated impact of base erosion and BEAT offset by the expected benefits related to FDII and the release of foreign valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.



For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to a reduction in the estimated impact of BEAT attributable to year-to-date losses from foreign exchange and translated earnings contracts, additional tax amounts related to GILTI and a benefit from the release of a foreign valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 



For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to additional tax expense of $172 million related to a preliminary agreement with the IRS to settle the income tax audit for the years 2013 and 2014, additional tax amounts related to GILTI and a benefit from the release of a foreign valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. The company expects to make a payment before the end of the year of approximately $40 million for the 2013-2014 tax audit settlements with the IRS. As of June 30, 2019, the company is not expecting any significant movements in the uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months.

Net Income Attributable to Corning Incorporated









Comprehensive Income 



For the three months ended June 30, 2019 comprehensive income decreased by $152 million when compared to the same period in 2018, due to lower net income of $646 million offset by $466 million of positive impacts from the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses, driven primarily by the Japanese yen and Korean won. 



For the six months ended June 30, 2019 comprehensive income increased by $515 million when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in net income of $442 million and $92 million of positive impacts from the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses, driven primarily by the euro and the Chinese yuan. These impacts were partially offset by $53 million related to the adoption of the new standard for reclassification of stranded tax effects in AOCI.



Refer to Note 12 (Shareholders’ Equity) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.



CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES



In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to report core performance measures. These items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates. Corning utilizes constant-currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and new Taiwan dollar currencies. Effective January 1, 2019, Corning also began using constant-currency reporting for our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments for the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The Company believes that the use of constant-currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations, and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows. Corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.



Core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures. With respect to the Company’s outlooks for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast foreign currency exchange rates or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control. As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.



For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” below.

Core Earnings per Common Share







Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures



We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows.



Core net sales, core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core earnings are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the Company’s operations.

Net loss decreased by $10 million, or 13%, and $12 million, or 8%, primarily driven by the increase in sales.



CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY



Financing and Capital Resources



There were no significant items that impacted Corning’s financing structure in the six months ended June 30, 2019.



In the second quarter of 2018, Corning issued ¥65.5 billion Japanese yen-denominated debt securities in tranches of 7, 10 and 12 years. The proceeds from these notes were received in Japanese yen and immediately converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance. The net proceeds received in U.S. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, was $596 million. Payments of principal and interest on the notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a U.S. dollar equivalent. 



Share Repurchase Program



In December 2016, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $4 billion share repurchase program with no expiration date (the “2016 Repurchase Program”). On April 26, 2018, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $2 billion share repurchase program with no expiration date (the “2018 Repurchase Program”).

Index



In the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 4.8 and 12.6 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $151 million and $395 million, respectively, as part of its 2018 Repurchase Program.



In the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 24.6 million and 51.6 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $674 million and $1,488 million, respectively, as part of its 2016 Repurchase Program. 



On July 17, 2019, Corning’s Board of Directors authorized $5 billion in share repurchases with no expiration date (the “2019 Repurchase Authorization”).



Capital Spending



Capital spending totaled $1.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2019. We expect our 2019 capital expenditures to be slightly more than $2.0 billion.



Cash Flow 







Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $911 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the prior year. The change was primarily driven by fewer customer deposits and incentives received of $574 million, and negative changes in certain working capital items, most notably accounts payable and other liabilities of $219 million and accounts receivable of $160 million.



Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $721 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same period last year, primarily resulting from the absence of acquisition costs in the current period. We acquired CMD in the second quarter of 2018 for a cash cost of $794 million.



Net cash used in financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased by $1.3 billion when compared to the same period last year, driven primarily by a decrease of $1.1 billion in share repurchases. 



Key Balance Sheet Data









Management Assessment of Liquidity



We ended the first half of 2019 with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world, with approximately 88% held outside of the United States, and are generally unrestricted. We utilize a variety of financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.

Index



Corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.5 billion. Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company’s Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed. At December 31, 2018 Corning had no outstanding commercial paper. As of June 30, 2019, Corning had $446 million of outstanding commercial paper.



Other 



We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues. We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.



Our major source of funding for 2019 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.



Our Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant. The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%. At June 30, 2019, our leverage using this measure was approximately 33%. As of June 30, 2019, we were in compliance and no amounts were outstanding.



Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument. As of June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all such provisions.



Management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity. In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources.



Off Balance Sheet Arrangements



There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our off-balance sheet arrangements as disclosed in our 2018 Form 10-K under the caption “Off Balance Sheet Arrangements.”



Contractual Obligations



There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the contractual obligations disclosed in our 2018 Form 10-K under the caption “Contractual Obligations.”



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES



The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described in our 2018 Form 10-K and remain unchanged through the first six months of 2019. For certain items, additional details are provided below.



Impairment of Assets Held for Use



We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. We review our long-lived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.



Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium. These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process and have a very long useful life. Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets. This review considers all the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity. Precious metals are only acquired to support our manufacturing operations and are not held for trading or other purposes.

Index



At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $380 million and $719 million, respectively. These precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments. Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments. The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments. Such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our Display Technologies or Specialty Materials segments.



NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 



Refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements.



ENVIRONMENT 



Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (“the Agency”) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Corning had accrued approximately $26 million and $30 million, respectively, for the undiscounted estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.



FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 



The statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the SEC on Forms 8-K, and related comments by management that are not historical facts or information and contain words such as “will,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “see,” “would,” and “target” and similar expressions are forward-looking statements. Such statements relate to future events that by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, the company’s future operating performance, the company's share of new and existing markets, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates, the company’s ability to innovate and commercialize new products, and the company’s implementation of cost-reduction initiatives and measures to improve pricing, including the optimization of the company’s manufacturing capacity.
