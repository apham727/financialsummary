ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES







Beginning April 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. As a result of the adoption of this standard, we implemented changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and the related internal controls. These changes include the development of new policies based on the five-step model provided in the ASC 606 standard, training of the new standard throughout the Company, creating work flows related to the review of contracts to determine the revenue recognition approach that should be used to recognize revenues and collecting information to be included in the ASC 606 disclosures.
