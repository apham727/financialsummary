NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)





1. Basis of Presentation



The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included, unless otherwise disclosed. Operating results for the three months and nine months ended December 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019. 



The Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet at March 31, 2018 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. 



The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K (SEC File No. 001-32253), which was filed on May 30, 2018 (the “2018 Annual Report”).



EnerSys (the “Company”) reports interim financial information for 13-week periods, except for the first quarter, which always begins on April 1, and the fourth quarter, which always ends on March 31. The four quarters in fiscal 2019 end on July 1, 2018, September 30, 2018, December 30, 2018, and March 31, 2019, respectively. The four quarters in fiscal 2018 ended on July 2, 2017, October 1, 2017, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018, respectively.



The consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially owned subsidiaries that the Company has the ability to control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” providing guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. 







1. identify the contract with a customer;



2. identify the performance obligations in the contract;



3. determine the transaction price;



4. allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and



5. recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.



The Company recognizes revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the performance obligation to a customer. Control of a performance obligation may transfer to the customer either at a point in time or over time depending on an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances for each contract, including the terms and conditions of the contract as agreed with the customer, as well as the nature of the products or services to be provided.



The Company's primary performance obligation to its customers is the delivery of finished goods and products, pursuant to purchase orders. Control of the products sold typically transfers to its customers at the point in time when the goods are shipped as this is also when title generally passes to its customers under the terms and conditions of our customer arrangements. 



Each customer purchase order sets forth the transaction price for the products and services purchased under that arrangement. Some customer arrangements include variable consideration, such as volume rebates, some of which depend upon the customers meeting specified performance criteria, such as a purchasing level over a period of time. The Company uses judgment to estimate the most likely amount of variable consideration at each reporting date. When estimating variable consideration the Company also applies judgment when considering the probability of whether a reversal of revenue could occur and only recognize revenue subject to this constraint.



Service revenues related to the work performed for the Company’s customers by its maintenance technicians generally represent a separate and distinct performance obligation. Control for these services passes to the customer as the services are performed. Service revenues for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 amounted to $37,472 and $106,672, respectively.



A small portion of the Company's customer arrangements oblige the Company to create customized products for its customers that require the bundling of both products and services into a single performance obligation because the individual products and services that are required to fulfill the customer requirements do not meet the definitions for a distinct performance obligation. These customized products generally have no alternative use to the Company and the terms and conditions of these arrangements give the Company the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit margin. For these arrangements, control transfers over time and the Company measures progress towards completion by selecting the input or output method that best depicts the transfer of control of the underlying goods and services to the customer for each respective arrangement. Methods used by the Company to measure progress toward completion include labor hours, costs incurred and units of production. Revenues recognized over time for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 amounted to $19,421 and $54,316, respectively.



On December 30, 2018, the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was approximately $97,189, of which, the Company estimates that approximately $34,244 will be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2019, $47,032 in fiscal 2020, $10,023 in fiscal 2021, $5,738 in fiscal 2022 and $152 in fiscal 2023. 



The Company's typical payment terms are 30 days and sales arrangements do not contain any significant financing component for its customers. 



Any payments that are received from a customer in advance, prior to the satisfaction of a related performance obligation and billings in excess of revenue recognized, are deferred and treated as a contract liability. Advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized are classified as current or non-current based on the timing of when recognition of revenue is expected. As of December 30, 2018, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $24,736 and $7,430, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $9,387 and $7,094, respectively. Amounts representing work completed and not billed to customers represent contract assets and were $31,916 and $24,810 as of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively. Revenues recognized during the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019, that were included in the contract liability at the beginning of the current quarter and nine months, amounted to $1,950 and $2,695, respectively.



The Company uses historic customer product return data as a basis of estimation for customer returns and records the reduction of sales at the time revenue is recognized. At December 30, 2018, the right of return asset related to the value of inventory anticipated to be returned from customers was $2,647 and refund liability representing amounts estimated to be refunded to customers was $5,013.



Freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income. If shipping activities are performed after a customer obtains control of a product, the Company applies a policy election to account for shipping as an activity to fulfill the promise to transfer the product to the customer. 



The Company applies a policy election to exclude transaction taxes collected from customers from sales when the tax is both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction.



The Company generally provides customers with a product warranty that provides assurance that the products meet standard specifications and are free of defects. The Company maintains a reserve for claims incurred under standard product warranty programs. Performance obligations related to service warranties are not material to the consolidated financial statements.



The Company pays sales commissions to its sales representatives, which may be considered as incremental costs to obtain a contract. However, since the recoverability period is less than one year, the Company has utilized the practical expedient to record these costs of obtaining a contract as an expense as they are incurred.



In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)”, which requires an entity to report the service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the same line item as other compensation costs. The other components of net (benefit) cost will be required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted and requires the retrospective method to be applied to all periods presented. The Company adopted this guidance effective April 1, 2018. The service cost component of pension expense continues to be recognized in cost of goods sold whereas other components of pension expense have been reclassified to “Other (income) expense, net” in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company reclassified $345 and $1,080, from “Cost of goods sold” relating to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, to “Other (income) expense, net” in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.



Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Adopted as of December 30, 2018



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). This update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. In order to evaluate the impact of ASU No. 2016-02, the Company has formed a project team and initiated the process of assessing critical components of this new guidance and the potential impact that the guidance may have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. This evaluation process includes a review of the Company's leasing contracts and an assessment of the completeness of the Company's lease population. The Company is anticipating electing available practical expedients, including the transition option, upon adoption on April 1, 2019. The Company is also currently implementing a software tool and concurrently identifying changes to its business processes, systems and controls to support adoption of the new standard. Based upon the assessment to date, the Company believes that a key change upon adoption of the lease standard will be the recognition of leased assets and liabilities on its balance sheet but has not yet determined the impact, if any, on its results of operations or statement of cash flows.





In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)”. The new standard will allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). The amendments eliminate the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act and will improve the usefulness of information reported to financial statements users. However, because the amendment only relates to the reclassification of the income tax effects of the Tax Act, the underlying guidance that requires that the effect of a change in tax laws or rates be included in income from continuing operations is not affected. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted, including the interim periods within those years. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.





On December 7, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Alpha Technologies Services, Inc. (“ATS”) and Alpha Technologies Ltd. (“ATL”), resulting in ATS and ATL becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the “share purchase”). Additionally, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Alpha Technologies Inc. and certain assets of Altair Advanced Industries, Inc. and other affiliates of ATS and ATL (all such sellers, together with ATS and ATL, “Alpha”), in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain restructuring agreements (collectively, the “asset acquisition” and together with the share purchase, the “acquisition”). Based in Bellingham, Washington, Alpha is a global industry leader in the comprehensive commercial-grade energy solutions for broadband, telecom, renewable, industrial and traffic customers around the world. The aggregate purchase consideration for the acquisition was $750,000, of which $650,000 was paid in cash and the balance was settled by issuing 1,177,630 shares of EnerSys common stock. These shares were issued out of the Company's treasury stock and were valued at $84.92 per share, which was based on the thirty-day volume weighted average stock price of the Company’s common stock at closing. The fair value of the 1,177,630 shares had an approximate closing date fair value of $100,000. The Company funded the cash portion of the acquisition with borrowings from the Amended Credit Facility as defined in Note 10. See Note 10 for additional information. 



The acquisition expands the Company's footprint in broadband and telecom markets.



The Company recorded the acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting and recognized the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The results of operations of Alpha have been included in the Company’s Americas segment beginning December 8, 2018. Included within operating expenses in the Company's Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income are acquisition costs of $10,192 and $12,360, respectively, for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019.



For the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 ended December 30, 2018, the contribution of the acquisition to net sales was $26,795. Alpha recorded a net loss of $4,440 for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 ended December 30, 2018, excluding the effect of the transaction and integration costs, and interest expense on the debt to finance the acquisition.



The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulting goodwill. These values are not yet finalized and are subject to change, which could be significant. The amounts recognized will be finalized as the 



information necessary to complete the analyses is obtained, but no later than December 7, 2019 or one year from the acquisition date (“the measurement period”).











The preliminary purchase price of the acquisition has been allocated to the Company’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill. Estimated goodwill deductible for tax purposes is $42,040. The preliminary allocation of purchase price is based upon a valuation undertaken by the Company and is subject to change during the measurement period. The initial accounting for the acquisition is incomplete pending final valuation of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.







The pro forma amounts include additional interest expense on the debt issued to finance the purchases, amortization and depreciation expense based on the estimated fair value and useful lives of intangible assets and plant assets, and related tax effects. The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the combined results had the Alpha acquisition been completed on April 1, 2017, nor are they indicative of future 



combined results. The pro forma results for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018 exclude pre-tax transaction costs of $10,192 and $12,360, respectively, as well as the pre-tax amortization of the acquisition date step up to fair value of inventories of $3,747 (these were recognized in the actual results of the third quarter and nine months fiscal 2019) as they are considered non-recurring in nature. The remeasurement of Alpha's deferred taxes due to the Tax Act are also being excluded in arriving at these pro forma results.



Other Intangible Assets







The Company’s amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was $3,105 and $7,220, for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively. The expected amortization expense based on the finite-lived intangible assets as of December 30, 2018, is $1,766 for the remainder of fiscal 2019, $8,281 in fiscal 2020, $8,023 in fiscal 2021, $7,941 in fiscal 2022 and $5,689 in fiscal 2023.



Goodwill













4. Fair Value of Financial Instruments



Recurring Fair Value Measurements









The fair values of lead forward contracts are calculated using observable prices for lead as quoted on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) and, therefore, were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in its 2018 Annual Report.



The fair values for foreign currency forward contracts are based upon current quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2 based on the nature of the underlying market in which these derivatives are traded.



Financial Instruments



The fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to their short maturities. 



The fair value of the Company’s short-term debt and borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility (as defined in Note 10), approximate their respective carrying value, as they are variable rate debt and the terms are comparable to market terms as of the balance sheet dates and are classified as Level 2.



The Company's 5.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”), with an original face value of $300,000, were issued in April 2015. The fair value of the Notes represent the trading values based upon quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2. The Notes were trading at approximately 97% and 102% of face value on December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively. 









5. Derivative Financial Instruments



The Company utilizes derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates under established procedures and controls. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The Company’s agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions and the Company anticipates performance by counterparties to these contracts and therefore no material loss is expected.



Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships



Lead Forward Contracts



The Company enters into lead forward contracts to fix the price for a portion of its lead purchases. Management considers the lead forward contracts to be effective against changes in the cash flows of the underlying lead purchases. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. At December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company has hedged the price to purchase approximately 77.0 million pounds and 62.9 million pounds of lead, respectively, for a total purchase price of $70,235 and $72,207, respectively.



Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of the Company’s foreign currency exposures for lead, as well as other foreign currency exposures so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the underlying foreign currency denominated exposures. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. As of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the notional amount of these contracts was $48,131 and $54,164, respectively.



In the coming twelve months, the Company anticipates that $4,929 of pretax loss relating to lead and foreign currency forward contracts will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) as part of cost of goods sold. This amount represents the current net unrealized impact of hedging lead and foreign exchange rates, which will change as market rates change in the future, and will ultimately be realized in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income as an offset to the corresponding actual changes in lead costs to be realized in connection with the variable lead cost and foreign exchange rates being hedged.



Derivatives not Designated in Hedging Relationships



Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany loans and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. These are not designated as hedging instruments and changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded directly in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income. As of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the notional amount of these contracts was $59,819 and $28,486, respectively.

The Company’s income tax provision consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. The tax provision for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 was based on the estimated effective tax rates applicable for the full years ending March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively, after giving effect to items specifically related to the interim periods. The Company’s effective income tax rate with respect to any period may be volatile based on the mix of income in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates, change in tax laws and the amount of the Company's consolidated income before taxes. 



On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law. Among the significant changes resulting from the law, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on unrepatriated cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The U.S. federal statutory tax rate for fiscal 2019 is 21.0%.



As of December 30, 2018, the Company had completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act. The Company recognized an income tax benefit during the quarter of $13,483, resulting from a decrease in the mandatory one-time transition tax on unremitted earnings of our foreign business. 



Beginning in fiscal 2019, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), foreign derived intangible income (“FDII”), and base-erosion and anti-abuse (“BEAT”) provisions became effective. The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its US income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. Under US GAAP, the Company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating the taxes due on future US inclusions in taxable income as a current-period expense when incurred (“period cost method”) or (2) factoring amounts into a Company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (“deferred method”). As of the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company has elected the period cost method. Based on existing legislative guidance and interpretation, the Company has estimated that its annual effective tax rate to increase by approximately 2.8% compared to prior year effective tax rate.



FDII allows a new deduction for U.S. corporations up to 37.5% of foreign derived intangible income. This is an export incentive that reduces the tax on foreign derived sales and service income. Based upon the existing legislative guidance and interpretation, the Company has estimated the impact on the annual effective tax rate to decrease by approximately 0.5% compared to prior year effective tax rate. 



The BEAT provisions eliminate the deductions of certain base-erosion payments to related foreign corporations and impose a minimum tax if greater than regular tax. The Company does not expect to be subject to BEAT in fiscal 2019.



The consolidated effective income tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were (13.3)% and 141.2%, respectively, and for the nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 10.4% and 63.2%, respectively. The rate decrease in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2018 is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions and items related to the Tax Act. 



Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be 74% for fiscal 2019 compared to 64% for fiscal 2018. The foreign effective income tax rates for the nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 11.8% and 11.4%, respectively. The rate increase compared to the prior year period is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. Income from the Company's Swiss subsidiary comprised a substantial portion of the Company's overall foreign mix of income and is taxed at an effective income tax rate of approximately 6%.









8. Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation



Litigation and Other Legal Matters



In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. These actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of environmental, anticompetition, employment, contract and other laws. In some of these actions and proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Company and its subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations, and threatened legal actions and proceedings. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by federal, state, local and foreign agencies, the Company and its subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders for documents, testimony and information in connection with various aspects of their activities.



European Competition Investigations 



Certain of the Company’s European subsidiaries had received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews from, and have had on-site inspections conducted by, the competition authorities of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands relating to conduct and anticompetitive practices of certain industrial battery participants. 



The Company settled the Belgian regulatory proceeding in February 2016 by acknowledging certain anticompetitive practices and conduct and agreeing to pay a fine of $1,962, which was paid in March 2016. During the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019, the Company paid $2,402 towards certain aspects of this matter, which are under appeal. As of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 and $2,326, respectively. 



In June 2017, the Company settled a portion of its previously disclosed proceeding involving the German competition authority relating to conduct involving the Company's motive power battery business and agreed to pay a fine of $14,811, which was paid in July 2017. As of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 relating to this matter. Also in June 2017, the German competition authority issued a fining decision related to the Company's reserve power battery business, which constitutes the remaining portion of the previously disclosed German proceeding. The Company is appealing this decision, including payment of the proposed fine of $11,415, and believes that the reserve power matter does not, based on current facts and circumstances known to management, require an accrual. The Company is not required to escrow any portion of this fine during the appeal process.



In July 2017, the Company settled the Dutch regulatory proceeding and agreed to pay a fine of $11,229, which was paid in August 2017. As of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 relating to the Dutch regulatory proceeding.



As of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had a total reserve balance of $0 and $2,326, respectively, in connection with these investigations and other related legal matters, included in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. The foregoing estimate of losses is based upon currently available information for these proceedings. However, the precise scope, timing and time period at issue, as well as the final outcome of the investigations or customer claims, remain uncertain. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate may change from time to time, and actual losses could vary.



EnerSys Sarl Litigation



In fiscal 2009, the Court of Commerce in Lyon, France ruled that the Company’s French subsidiary, EnerSys Sarl, which was acquired by the Company in 2002, was partially responsible for a 1999 fire in a French hotel under construction. The Company’s portion of damages was 



assessed at €2,700, or $4,200, which was duly recorded and paid by the Company, but the ruling was appealed. In a subsequent ruling by the Court of Appeal of Lyon, France, the Company's portion of damages was reduced, entitling the Company to a refund of the monies paid of €671, or $900, which was recorded and collected in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. The Company further appealed the ruling to the French Supreme Court, which on March 14, 2012, ruled in the Company’s favor and ordered the case back to the Court of Appeal of Lyon to further review certain aspects of the original decision in the case, including the assessment of damages. The Court of Appeal of Lyon heard arguments on April 9, 2013 and ruled in the Company’s favor on June 11, 2013, entitling the Company to a refund of the monies paid of €2,000, or $2,756. One of the parties to the litigation that is adverse to the Company appealed this ruling to the French Supreme Court which appeal was denied in January 2015. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company and the adverse party settled this final item with the Company receiving a refund, including interest, from the adverse party of €2,500, or $2,843, for monies paid. The Company believes that it has no further liability with respect to this matter.



Environmental Issues



As a result of its operations, the Company is subject to various federal, state, and local, as well as international environmental laws and regulations and is exposed to the costs and risks of registering, handling, processing, storing, transporting, and disposing of hazardous substances, especially lead and acid. The Company’s operations are also subject to federal, state, local and international occupational safety and health regulations, including laws and regulations relating to exposure to lead in the workplace. 



The Company is responsible for certain cleanup obligations at the former Yuasa battery facility in Sumter, South Carolina, that predates its ownership of this facility. This manufacturing facility was closed in 2001 and the Company established a reserve for this facility, which was $1,082 and $1,109, as of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively. Based on current information, the Company’s management believes this reserve is adequate to satisfy the Company’s environmental liabilities at this facility. This facility is separate from the Company’s current metal fabrication facility in Sumter.



Lead and Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



To stabilize its lead costs and reduce volatility from currency movements, the Company enters into contracts with financial institutions. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. Please refer to Note 5 - Derivative Financial Instruments for more details. 





During fiscal 2017, the Company announced restructuring programs to improve efficiencies primarily related to its motive power production in EMEA. The Company estimates that the total charges for these actions will amount to approximately $4,700, primarily from cash charges for employee severance-related payments and other charges. The Company estimates that these actions will result in the reduction of approximately 45 employees upon completion. During fiscal 2017, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $3,104 and an additional $1,610 during fiscal 2018. The Company incurred $749 in costs against the accrual in fiscal 2017 and an additional $2,403 during fiscal 2018. During the nine months of fiscal 2019, the Company incurred $1,414 against the accrual. As of December 30, 2018, the reserve balance associated with these actions is $270.

2017 Credit Facility and Subsequent Amendment



On August 4, 2017, the Company entered into a credit facility (the “2017 Credit Facility”). The 2017 Credit Facility matures on September 30, 2022 and comprises a $600,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolver”) and a $150,000 senior secured term loan (“2017 Term Loan”). The Company's previous credit facility (“2011 Credit Facility”) comprised a $500,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (“2011 Revolver”) and a $150,000 senior secured incremental term loan (the “2011 Term Loan”) with a maturity date of September 30, 2018. On August 4, 2017, the outstanding balance on the 2011 Revolver and the 2011 Term Loan of $240,000 and $123,750, respectively, was repaid utilizing borrowings from the 2017 Credit Facility.

The Amended Credit Facility consists of $449,105 senior secured term loans (the “Amended 2017 Term Loan”), including a CAD 133,050 ($99,105) term loan and a $700,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Amended 2017 Revolver”).

Item 1.Legal Proceedings



From time to time, we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business. See Litigation and Other Legal Matters in Note 8 - Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.



Item 1A.Risk Factors



In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2018 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2018, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results and the following.



If our due diligence investigation of Alpha was inadequate or if unexpected risks related to Alpha’s business materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our stockholders' investment.



Even though we conducted a due diligence investigation of Alpha, we cannot be sure that our diligence surfaced all material issues that may be present inside Alpha or its business, or that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of Alpha and its business and outside of its control will not arise later. If any such material issues arise, they may materially and adversely impact the on-going business of EnerSys and our stockholders’ investment.



Expected combination benefits from the Transaction may not be fully-realized or realized within the expected time frame. 



The ability of Alpha and EnerSys to realize the anticipated benefits of the Transaction will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to combine Alpha’s and our businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies, and achieves the projected stand-alone cost savings and revenue growth trends identified by each company. It is expected that we will benefit from operational and general and administrative cost synergies resulting from the warehouse and transportation integration, direct procurement savings on overlapping materials, purchasing scale on indirect spend categories and optimization of duplicate positions and processes. We may also enjoy revenue synergies, driven by a strong portfolio of brands with exposure to higher growth segments and the ability to leverage our collective distribution strength. In order to achieve these expected benefits, we must successfully combine the businesses of Alpha and EnerSys in a manner that permits these cost savings and synergies to be realized and must achieve the anticipated savings and synergies without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If we experience difficulties with the integration process or are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.



The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union could harm our business and financial results.



In June 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly



referred to as “Brexit”). In March 2017, the UK government initiated the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union,



commencing a period of up to two years for the United Kingdom and the other EU member states to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal. The British government and the European Union have now negotiated a withdrawal agreement, and the European Union has approved that agreement, but the British Parliament has not yet approved it. As a result, there remains considerable uncertainty around the withdrawal. Failure to obtain parliamentary approval of the negotiated withdrawal agreement would mean that the United Kingdom would leave the European Union on March 29, 2019, probably with no agreement (a so-called "hard Brexit"). The consequences for the economies of the European Union members and of the United Kingdom exiting the European Union are unknown and unpredictable, especially in the case of a hard Brexit. Depending on the final terms of Brexit, we could face new regulatory costs and challenges and greater volatility in the Pound Sterling and the euro. Any adjustments we make to our business and operations as of Brexit could result in significant time and expense to complete. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
