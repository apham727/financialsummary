Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 



Business Overview 



Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (PC), and mobile devices. We also operate esports events and leagues and create film and television content based on our intellectual property. The terms Activision Blizzard, the Company, we, us, and our are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 



The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. In connection with the 2008 business combination (the Business Combination) by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A. (Vivendi), and Vivendi Games, Inc. (Vivendi Games), then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi, we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc. 



The common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol ATVI. 



Our Segments 



As part of the continued implementation of our esports strategy, we instituted changes to our internal organization and reporting structure during 2017 such that the Major League Gaming (MLG) business operates as a division of Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. (Blizzard). Commencing with the second quarter of 2017, MLG, which was previously a separate operating segment, became a component of the Blizzard operating segment. MLG is responsible for the operations of the Overwatch League, along with other esports events, and will also continue to serve as a multi-platform network for other Activision Blizzard esports content. 







Activision Publishing, Inc. (Activision), is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the console platform. Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products based on our internally developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties. We have also established a long-term alliance with Bungie to publish its game universe, Destiny.

Blizzard is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the PC platform. Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net®, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content, along with Activisions Destiny 2 PC content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content. As noted above, Blizzard also includes the activities of our MLG business, which is responsible for the operations of the Overwatch League, along with other esports events, and will also continue to serve as a multi-platform network for other Activision Blizzard esports content. 







King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly on mobile platforms, such as Google Inc.s (Google) Android and Apple Inc.s (Apple) iOS. King also distributes its content and services on the PC platform, primarily via Facebook. Kings games are free to play, however, players can acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency the players purchase or directly using real currency. 





Other 





· the Activision Blizzard Studios (Studios) business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of globally recognized intellectual properties, and which, in October 2017, released the second season of the animated TV series Skylanders Academy on Netflix; and 



· the Activision Blizzard Distribution (Distribution) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware. 



Business Results and Highlights 



Financial Results 



The Companys financial results for 2018 are presented in accordance with a new revenue accounting standard that was adopted in the first quarter of 2018. Prior period results have not been restated to reflect this change in accounting standards. Further information about our adoption of the new standard is provided in Notes 2 and 3 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 





· consolidated net revenues increased 14% to $1.97 billion, while consolidated operating income increased 21% to $595 million, as compared to consolidated net revenues of $1.73 billion and consolidated operating income of $493 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017; 



· revenues from digital online channels were $1.46 billion, or 74% of consolidated net revenues, as compared to $1.39 billion, or 80% of consolidated net revenues, for the three months ended March 31, 2017; 





Table of Contents 



· operating margin was 30.3%, as compared with 28.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2017; 



· cash flows from operating activities were $529 million, an increase of 29%, as compared to $411 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017; 



· consolidated net income increased 17% to $500 million, as compared to $426 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017; and 



· diluted earnings per common share increased 16% to $0.65, as compared to $0.56 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. 



Since certain of our games are hosted online or include significant online functionality that represents a separate performance obligation, we defer the transaction price allocable to the online functionality from the sale of these games and recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year. Net revenues and operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, include a net effect of $581 million and $373 million, respectively, from the recognition of deferred net revenues and related cost of revenues. 



Content Release and Event Highlights 





Operating Metrics 



The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. 



Net Bookings 











· higher net bookings from the Candy Crush franchise due to increased monetization, primarily through in-game events and features; and 





The increase was partially offset by lower net bookings from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016. 





Table of Contents 



Monthly Active Users 



We monitor monthly active users (MAUs) as a key measure of the overall size of our user base. MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period. An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user. 







Average MAUs decreased by 11 million, or 3%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to minor decreases across franchises and less engaged users leaving the network. The decrease in Activisions average MAUs is due primarily to lower MAUs for Destiny 2. 



Average MAUs decreased by 57 million, or 13%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to decreases across Kings franchises that are largely attributable to the maturity of Kings titles and less engaged users leaving the network. 



Managements Overview of Business Trends 



Interactive Entertainment and Mobile Gaming Growth 



Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry. Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry has grown, on average, 18% over the last three years. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more common place across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment. 



Further, the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable market for gaming significantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is estimated to be larger than console and PC gaming and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from, our franchises. 





Table of Contents 



Opportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games 



Our fans spend significant time investing in our franchises through purchases of our game content, whether through purchases of full games or downloadable content or via microtransactions. Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emerging opportunities to drive additional engagement and investment in our franchises outside of games. These opportunities include esports, film and television, and consumer products. Our efforts to build these adjacent opportunities are still relatively nascent, but we view them as potentially significant sources of future revenues. 



As part of our efforts to take advantage of the esports opportunity, during 2017 we completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, and the inaugural season is underway. 



Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises 



The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry. According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 36% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2017. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games were responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch franchises, collectively, accounted for 66% of our consolidated net revenuesand a significantly higher percentage of our operating incomefor 2017. 



The top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. The top 10 console franchises in 2017 were all established franchises. Similarly, according to U.S. rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play store per App Annie Intelligence, as of December 2017, the top 10 mobile games have an average tenure of 22 months. 



In addition to investing in, and developing sequels and content for, our top franchises, we are continually exploring additional ways to expand those franchises. Further, while there is no guarantee of success, we invest in new properties in an effort to develop future top franchises. In 2014, we released Hearthstone and Destiny, in 2015, we released Heroes of the Storm, and in 2016, we released Overwatch. Additionally, to diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase our presence in the mobile market, on February 23, 2016, we completed the acquisition of King. 



Overall, we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our, and the industrys, revenues and profits in the near future. Accordingly, our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against our competitors top franchises can significantly impact our performance. 



Recurring Revenue Business Models 



Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more consistently recurring and year-round model. Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year. This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal.

· higher revenues from King of $68 million, primarily driven by the Candy Crush franchises increased monetization, primarily through in-game events and features. 





Change in Deferred Revenues Recognized 



The increase in net deferred revenues recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to higher net deferred revenues recognized for Activision of $193 million, primarily due to higher net deferred revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise, driven by the release of Destiny 2 in September 2017, with no comparable release in 2016. 





Foreign Exchange Impact 



Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $110 million on Activision Blizzards consolidated net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound. 



Operating Segment Results 





Our operating segments are also consistent with our internal organization structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the availability of separate financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments. As discussed in the Business Overview above, commencing with the second quarter of 2017, we made changes to our operating segments which reflect the changes in our organization and reporting structure. Our MLG business, which was previously included in the non-reportable Other segments, is now presented within the Blizzard reportable segment. Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect this change. This change had no impact on consolidated net revenues or operating income.

The increase was partially offset by lower revenues from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016. 



King 



The increase in Kings net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchises increased monetization, primarily through in-game events and features. 



Segment Income from Operations 



Activision 



The increase in Activisions operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to the higher revenues, as discussed above, and lower product costs from lower sales of our previously released titles for the Skylanders and Guitar Hero franchises, which typically had higher product costs per unit due to the included physical items (i.e. toys and guitars). This was partially offset by higher personnel and external developer costs to support existing and upcoming title releases. 





Table of Contents 



Blizzard 



The decrease in Blizzards operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to costs incurred to operate and market new business initiatives and higher personnel costs to support Blizzards overall business. This was partially offset by higher capitalization of software development costs due to the timing of the game development cycle. 



King 



The increase in Kings operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to the higher revenues, as discussed above. The increase was partially offset by higher software development costs. 



Foreign Exchange Impact 



Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $72 million on reportable segment net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in the previous year. The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.

Mobile and Ancillary 



The increase in net revenues from mobile and ancillary for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchises increased monetization, primarily through in-game events and features. 





Table of Contents 



Costs and Expenses 



Cost of Revenues 









The increase in product costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to higher product costs of $18 million driven by the increase in product sales associated with the Call of Duty and Destiny franchises, partially offset by lower product costs from lower sales of our previously-released titles for the Skylanders and Guitar Hero franchises, which typically had higher product costs per unit due to the included physical items (i.e. toys and guitars). 









· higher digital storefront fees (e.g. fees retained by Apple and Google for our sales on their platforms) of $20 million, primarily associated with the increase in our mobile revenues; and 



· higher personnel, facilities, and equipment costs of $16 million associated with our online games and broadcasting operations. 



The decrease in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to subscription, licensing, and other revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease of $37 million in the amount of amortization associated with internally-developed franchise intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of King. 



Product Development (amounts in millions) 







Table of Contents 



The increase in product development costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to a $59 million increase in personnel and external developer costs to support existing and upcoming title releases. The increase was partially offset by higher capitalization of software development costs of $25 million due to the timing of the game development cycle. 



Sales and Marketing (amounts in millions) 





Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were comparable to the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to a $39 million increase in marketing spending and personnel costs, primarily associated with the Candy Crush franchise and the Overwatch League, which started its inaugural regular season in January 2018, partially offset by marketing for the Bubble Witch franchise, as Bubble Witch 3 Saga was released during the first quarter of 2017, with no comparable release in 2018. The increase was partially offset by a $33 million decrease in amortization associated with the customer base intangible asset acquired in the acquisition of King, as the asset was fully amortized during the period. 



General and Administrative (amounts in millions) 





The increase in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to a $33 million increase in personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, facilities costs, and professional fees, to support the growth of our business and adjacent areas of opportunity. The increase was partially offset by the inclusion of non-cash accounting charge of $16 million in 2017 to reclassify certain losses included in our cumulative translation adjustments into earnings due to the substantial liquidation of certain of our foreign entities, for which there was no comparable activity in 2018. 



Interest and Other Expense (Income), Net (amounts in millions) 





The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to higher interest income of $11 million from our cash and cash equivalents as compared to the prior period. 



Income Tax Expense (amounts in millions) 







Table of Contents 



The income tax expense of $67 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, reflects an effective tax rate of 12%, which is higher than the effective tax rate of 6% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase is due to a lower excess tax benefit from share-based payments, partially offset by the impact of new provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the U.S. Tax Reform Act), including the reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate and the impact of foreign derived intangible income (FDII) net of the tax on global intangible low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries (GILTI). 



The effective tax rate of 12% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower statutory rates, the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payments, and the recognition of federal and California research and development credits. 



On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposes a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. 



On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118, which provides guidance on how to account for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act under ASC 740. SAB 118 enables companies to record a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year, until accounting is complete. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional amounts for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act in accordance with SAB 118. Accounting for the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act requires complex new calculations to be performed and significant judgments in interpreting the legislation. Additional guidance may be issued on how the provisions of the U.S. Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. We may make adjustments to the provisional amounts as we collect and prepare the data necessary to finalize our calculations, interpret the U.S. Tax Reform Act and any additional guidance issued, and consider the effects of any additional actions we may take as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, there were no changes made to the provisional amounts that were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. We will continue to analyze the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 



We continue to evaluate the impact of the U.S. Tax Reform Act, including provisions impacting certain foreign income, such as GILTI and a deduction for FDII. These provisions are complex and subject to continuing regulatory interpretation by the IRS. While we have included an estimate of GILTI and FDII in our estimated effective tax rate for 2018, we may make adjustments as we interpret the U.S. Tax Reform Act and any additional guidance issued, and consider the effects of any additional actions we may take as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. 





Further information about our income taxes is provided in Note 13 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 



Liquidity and Capital Resources 



We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. In the near term, we expect our business and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5.3 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $250 million revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months. Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as our anticipated dividend payments, share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities. 





Table of Contents 



As of March 31, 2018, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $3.4 billion, as compared to $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. Following the enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform Act and the current period expense on unrepatriated earnings, we no longer consider these available cash balances, which primarily relate to undistributed earnings of our most significant foreign subsidiaries, to be indefinitely reinvested. 



Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. We consider, on a continuing basis, various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, share repurchases, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments. 



Sources of Liquidity (amounts in millions) 







Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 





Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $529 million, as compared to $411 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher net income in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the first quarter of 2017, along with larger adjustments to net income for non-cash charges, primarily associated with deferred income taxes. The increase was partially offset by changes in our working capital due to the timing of collections and payments. 



Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 



The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions. 





Table of Contents 





· purchases of available-for-sale investments of $20 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, with no comparable transaction in the prior period; and 



· capital expenditures of $31 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $21 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. 



Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities 



The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends. 



Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $8 million, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $404 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The change was primarily attributed to our debt financing activities in the prior year. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we had net debt repayments of $500 million, with no comparable repayment activity for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This impact was partially offset by lower proceeds from stock option exercises and higher tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units of $47 million and $39 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $109 million and $13 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. 



Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes 



Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $18 million and a positive impact of $19 million on our cash and cash equivalents for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound. 



Debt 



As of both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our total outstanding debt was $4.4 billion, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 3.64% and 3.58%, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, there was no activity associated with our debt instruments except for normal recurring interest payments. 



On February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized repayments of up to $1.8 billion of the companys outstanding debt during 2018. The determination as to if and when we make any such repayment will be dependent on market conditions and other factors. 





Table of Contents 









Refer to Note 10 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further disclosures regarding our debt obligations. 



Dividends 



On February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.34 per common share. Such dividend is payable on May 9, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2018. We have recorded $259 million of dividends payable in Accrued expenses and other liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2018. 



Capital Expenditures 



For the year ending December 31, 2018, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $140 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, capital expenditures were $31 million. 



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 



At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 



Revenue Recognition 



As discussed in Note 2 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition and on January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments (the new revenue accounting standard), utilizing the modified retrospective method. Additionally, we elected to apply the new revenue accounting standard only to contracts not completed as of the adoption date. For contracts that were modified before the period of adoption, we elected to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications when (i) identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, (ii) determining the transaction price, and (iii) allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue accounting standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The cumulative effect adjustment recorded to our retained earnings at January 1, 2018 was $88 million.

· The accounting for our sales of our games with significant online functionality for which we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided. Under the prior accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements was required. This requirement was eliminated under the new revenue accounting standard. Accordingly, we are required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of this software, as compared to recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated service period, as previously required. This difference in accounting primarily impacted revenues from our Call of Duty franchise, where approximately 20% of the sales price is now recognized as revenue upon delivery of the games to our customers. Many of our other franchises, such as Destiny, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, are online hosted arrangements, and the accounting for our sales of these games under the new standard is relatively unchanged; and 



· The accounting for certain of our software licensing arrangements. While the impacts of the new revenue accounting standard may differ on a contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms), the new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements. 



For additional discussion regarding the impact of our adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, including the impacts to our condensed consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations, see Note 3 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 



Statement of Cash Flows-Restricted Cash 



In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. 



We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented. The application of this new standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. 



In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018, there will be a significant impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the acquisition of King, and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 to complete the acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance will be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, will not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows. 



Derivatives and Hedging 



In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for derivatives and hedging. The new guidance expands and refines hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedged items in the financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of a hedges effectiveness. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the standard during the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Leases 



In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for its leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, with certain transition practical expedients available to provide relief in adopting the new standard. We are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements, but expect it to have a material impact to our consolidated balance sheet as a result of establishing lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for our operating leases. We do not plan to early adopt this new standard but do expect to elect and apply the available transition practical expedients upon adoption.
