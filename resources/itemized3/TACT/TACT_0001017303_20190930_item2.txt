We operate in one reportable segment, the design, development, and marketing of software-driven technology and printing solutions for high growth markets, and provide related services, supplies and spare parts. 



Business Highlights 





In April 2019, TransAct announced that it secured commitments from 10 distinct restaurant or foodservice operators representing a broad mix of customers to deploy BOHA! solutions in their operations, and that it expects to roll out approximately 240 BOHA! Terminals over the balance of 2019 relating to these commitments. 



In June 2019, TransAct announced an agreement with a large, international foodservice brand that includes the deployment of BOHA! hardware and software across an initial 1,000 locations that will roll out by the end of 2019. Based on additional expansions of this customer’s stores and a successful roll out of BOHA!, the potential for additional deployments of BOHA! hardware and software could include 2,000 to 3,000 more locations over the next two to three years. 





In July 2019, TransAct announced that it secured a new agreement with a large U.S. foodservice provider for the deployment of BOHA! terminals and one of the BOHA! SaaS-based apps at more than 400 locations by 2021 year end. TransAct expects approximately 175 customer locations will be live with the BOHA! hardware and software solutions by 2019 year end with an additional approximately 250 locations expected to go live over the following two years. 





In July 2019, TransAct also announced its first ever agreement to deploy the Company’s BOHA! solution in the Asia-Pacific market as well as the first BOHA! agreement with an operator in the casino and gaming industry. The new agreement, with a leading Macau casino resort, will include 100 BOHA! terminals and one of the BOHA! SaaS based apps. We completed the sale during the third quarter of 2019. 



In September 2019, TransAct announced a new agreement with a regional foodservice operator to deploy the BOHA! Terminal and one of the Company’s BOHA! SaaS-based apps across 45 locations in the U.S. TransAct expects approximately 30 customer locations to go live with the BOHA! Terminal, the BOHA! Labeling SaaS-based app and TransAct Enterprise Management System (TEMS) over the next 12 months, with an additional 15 locations to follow over time. This new BOHA! customer will also purchase TransAct labels, which are specifically designed to work with the thermal printers featured in the BOHA! Terminal. 



Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates 



Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The presentation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, depreciable lives of equipment, warranty obligations, and contingent liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. 



For a complete description of our accounting policies, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have reviewed those policies and determined that they remain our critical accounting policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 











Net sales for the third quarter of 2019 decreased $4.2 million, or 26%, from the same period in 2018. Printer, terminal and other hardware sales volume decreased 37% to approximately 27,000 units for the third quarter of 2019 driven primarily by a 39% decrease in unit volume from the casino and gaming market and, to a lesser extent, an 88% decrease in the lottery market and 23% decrease in the POS automation and banking market. These decreases were partially offset by a 21% increase in terminal and hardware volume sales in our restaurant solutions market. The average selling price of our printers, terminals and other hardware increased 3% during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 due primarily to a lower level of lottery printer sales and POS automation and banking printer sales, which sell at a lower price than our other products. 





International sales for the third quarter of 2019 decreased $0.4 million, or 11%, from the same period in 2018 due to a 12% decrease in sales in the international casino and gaming market and a 44% decrease in sales in the international Printrex market. 









The increase in restaurant solutions sales in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 was driven primarily by sales of our BOHA! software, labels and other recurring revenue. Sales of BOHA! software recognized on a SaaS subscription basis, labels and other recurring revenue increased by 267%, including an over 250% increase in label sales and a ten-fold increase in software sales (though off of a low base in the third quarter of 2018) in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018. Hardware sales increased by 2% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018. On a unit basis, however, Hardware sales increased by 21%, as we shipped our first BOHA! solution sale to a casino operator located in the Asia-Pacific market. We consciously decided to lower the average selling price on our BOHA! terminals to encourage customers to adopt our total BOHA! solution, which includes hardware as well as recurring software subscription revenue, service and label sales. 







The decrease in both domestic and international POS automation and banking product revenue for the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a 26% decrease in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, largely to McDonald’s. We expect sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer to McDonald’s to be lower for the full year 2019 compared to the full year 2018. 









The decrease in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due to a 50% decline in domestic sales of our thermal casino printers in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018, driven primarily by a large order of replacement printers from a domestic casino operator during the third quarter of 2018 that did not reoccur in the third quarter of 2019, as well as decreased sales to our OEMs. Additionally, we experienced a decrease in domestic sales of an off-premise gaming printer to an OEM, which we do not expect to reoccur in 2019. These decreases were partially offset by slightly higher revenue from recurring EPICENTRALTM annual software maintenance fees during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018. We did not complete any new installations of our EPICENTRAL™ software systems in the third quarter of 2019 or 2018. Sales of EPICENTRAL™ are project based, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. 



The decrease in international sales of our casino and gaming products in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 was due to a 20% decrease in sales of our thermal casino printers due primarily to lower sales to a large OEM in Europe. The decrease was partially offset by 37% higher international sales of our off-premise gaming printers during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018, primarily to an OEM in Europe for sports betting, as well as stronger sales in Australia. 







Our sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations that IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Our sales to IGT are not indicative of IGT’s overall business or revenue. We expect lottery printer sales to be significantly lower for the full year 2019 compared to the full year 2018, as we have shifted our focus away from the lottery market to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products and we expect IGT to order printers only on an as-needed basis during the full year 2019 and beyond. 









The decrease in sales of Printrex printers for the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 resulted from a 43% decrease in domestic and international sales in the oil and gas market, as sales for the third quarter of 2018 were unusually high. This decrease was partially offset by higher sales from the international medical and mobile market which we exited at the end of 2018 but will continue to fulfill orders from legacy customers until our inventory is exhausted. We expect sales for the remainder of 2019 to be relatively consistent with the first nine months of 2019, as we have shifted our focus away from the Printrex market to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products. 







The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the prior year period was due primarily to lower sales of replacement parts including lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT. This decrease was partially offset by increased service revenue of 48% resulting largely from increased repairs of POS printers for McDonald’s. Based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments for replacement parts, primarily from IGT, for our installed base of lottery printers as well as declining sales of consumables for our legacy products, we expect total TSG sales to decrease for the full year 2019 compared to 2018. 



Internationally, TSG revenue decreased in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 due primarily to a decline of international consumable product sales of 77% and, to a lesser extent, a 6% decline in international sales of replacement parts and accessories. 







Gross profit is measured as revenue less cost of sales, which includes primarily the cost of all raw materials and component parts, direct labor, manufacturing overhead expenses, cost of finished products purchased directly from our contract manufacturers and expenses associated with installations and support of our EPICENTRALTM print system and BOHA! software solutions. For the third quarter of 2019, gross profit decreased $2.5 million, or 31%, due primarily to a 26% decline in sales during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018. Gross margin decreased 300 basis points in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the record high margin of 50.5% in the third quarter of 2018 on lower sales of casino printers and lottery spare parts which carry higher margins than our other products. Although both sales and gross margin decreased during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018, we expect full year gross margin for 2019 to be consistent with the full year 2018, as our sales mix shifts towards higher-value, technology-driven solutions, as well as lower sales of POS printers and lottery printers, which carry lower margins than our other products. 









Engineering, design and product development expenses primarily includes salary and payroll related expenses for our hardware and software engineering staff, depreciation and design expenses (including prototype printer expenses, outside design, development and testing services, supplies and contract software development expenses). Such expenses decreased $58 thousand, or 5% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018, primarily due to lower expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets. We expect engineering, design and product development expenses for the full year 2019 to be slightly lower compared to the full year 2018 due to lower product development costs. 







Selling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, sales commissions, travel expenses, expenses associated with the lease of sales offices, advertising, trade show expenses, e-commerce and other promotional marketing expenses. Such expenses increased $149 thousand, or 8%, for the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018. During the third quarter of 2019, we incurred higher compensation expenses related to the hiring of additional outside and technical sales and marketing staff as well as higher promotional marketing expenses to support the expected growth in our restaurant solutions market. We expect selling and marketing expense to increase significantly in the full year 2019 compared to the full year 2018 due to the full-year impact of hiring additional sales staff during 2018 and 2019, as well as investments to support our new suite of BOHA! software and hardware solutions. 







General and administrative expenses primarily include salaries, incentive compensation, and other payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resources and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company. General and administrative expenses increased $351 thousand, or 19%, for the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher professional and legal expenses and higher recruiting expenses for the new sales and marketing staff to support the restaurant solutions market. We expect general and administrative expense to be higher in the full year 2019 compared to the full year 2018 due to additional investment to support restaurant solutions. 







Our operating income decreased $2.9 million, or 90%, in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018, and our operating margin decreased to 2.7% of net sales due to a decline in sales of 26% and a 300 basis point decline in gross margin during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year period. Additionally, operating expenses increased 9% during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018. 



Interest. We recorded no net interest income or expense in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $7 thousand of net interest expense in the third quarter of 2018. We expect that net interest expense will be slightly lower in the full year 2019 compared to the full year 2018, as interest income earned on the note receivable will largely offset interest expense incurred on unused borrowings under our revolving credit line. 





Other, net. We recorded other expense of $71 thousand in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $50 thousand in the third quarter of 2018 due to higher foreign exchange losses recorded by our U.K. entity in the third quarter of 2019. Going forward, we may continue to experience more foreign exchange gains or losses depending on the level of sales to Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and the change in exchange rates of the Euro and Pound Sterling against the U.S. dollar. 





Net Income. We reported net income for the third quarter of 2019 of $384 thousand, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to $2.6 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2018. 











Net sales for the first nine months of 2019 decreased $8.2 million, or 19%, from the same period in 2018. Printer, terminal and other hardware sales volume decreased by 26% to approximately 83,000 units in the first nine months of 2019 driven by decreases across all our markets. These volume decreases were primarily due to a 24% decrease in unit volume from the casino and gaming market and, to a lesser extent, a 26% and 54% unit decrease in our POS automation and banking market and lottery market, respectively. The average selling price of our printers, terminals and other hardware increased 2% during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. 



International sales decreased $0.6 million, or 8%, primarily driven by an 11% decrease of international casino and gaming sales. This decrease was partially offset by a 24% increase from our international TSG market and a 41% increase from our international restaurant solutions market during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. 





Restaurant solutions. Sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages). Note that we have reclassified sales of labels and other recurring revenue items, which includes extended warranty and service contracts, and technical support services previously included in TSG to Restaurant Solutions for all periods presented in this Report. 







The increase in restaurant solutions terminal sales in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 was driven by sales of our BOHA! software, labels and other recurring revenue. Sales of BOHA! software recognized on a SaaS subscription basis, labels and other recurring revenue increased by 291%, including a 241% increase in label sales and a twenty-fold increase in software sales (though off a low base in the first nine months of 2018). Hardware sales declined by 16% on lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our former U.S. distributor and lower sales of our BOHA! terminal to three large corporate customers, in support of large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal in the first nine months of last year that did not reoccur in 2019. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our BOHA! terminal to a convenience store supplier and increased sales of our AccuDate Pro terminal. 



International restaurant solutions sales increased during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due to increased sales of the AccuDate 9700 terminal through a European distributor and sales of our BOHA! solutions to a casino operator in Asia. 







The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 was primarily driven by a 25% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s decreased during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. 



International POS automation and banking sales decreased due to lower sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer to our Canadian distributor for McDonald’s during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. 







The decrease in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products for the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 was due primarily to a 24% decrease in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer, driven primarily by a large order from a domestic casino operator for replacement printers during 2018 that did not reoccur in 2019, as well as lower sales to our domestic OEMs. Additionally, domestic sales of our off-premise gaming printers decreased 95% during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due to sales to an OEM in the 2018 period that we do not expect to reoccur in 2019. Domestic EPICENTRAL™ software sales decreased 38%, as we had no new installations during the first nine months of 2019 compared to one new installation during the same period for 2018. 





The decrease in international sales in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 was due to a 9% decline in international sales of our thermal casino printer due to lower European sales and a 19% decline in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to Europe, Australia and Asia. Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. 







Our sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations that IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Our sales to IGT are not indicative of IGT’s overall business or revenue. 







The decrease in sales of Printrex printers during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 resulted from a 16% decrease in domestic and international sales in the oil and gas market. This decrease was partially offset by higher sales from the international medical and mobile market during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. 



TSG. Sales in our worldwide TSG market for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages). Note that we have reclassified sales of labels, extended warranty and service contracts, and technical support services related to our Restaurant Solutions market, which were previously included in TSG, to Restaurant Solutions for all periods presented in this Report. 





The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the first nine months of 2019 as compared to the first nine months of 2018 was due primarily to 37% lower sales of replacement parts due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT. This decrease was partially offset by increased service revenue of 31% during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. 



Internationally, TSG revenue increased during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 primarily due to a 38% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers. This increase was partially offset by a 41% decrease of international consumable sales during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. 









Gross profit decreased $3.5 million, or 17%, in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due largely to a 19% decline in sales during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by a 140 basis point increase in gross margin during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. The increased gross margin reflects lower manufacturing overhead spending and a favorable shift in sales mix towards higher-value, technology-driven solutions, as well as lower sales of POS printers and lottery printers, which carry lower margins than our other products. 







Engineering, design and product development expenses decreased $182 thousand, or 5%, in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 primarily due to lower expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets. 







Selling and marketing expenses increased $440 thousand, or 8%, during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due primarily to higher compensation expenses related to the hiring of additional outside sales, technical sales and marketing staff and higher promotional marketing expenses for our restaurant solutions market. 







General and administrative expenses increased $509 thousand, or 8%, in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due primarily to higher professional and legal expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower recruiting and employee termination expenses incurred during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. 







Our operating income decreased $4.3 million, or 75%, during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 due to a decrease in sales of 19% and a 5% increase in operating expenses, partially offset by a 140 basis point increase of gross margin during the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. 





Interest. We recorded net interest expense of $13 thousand in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $21 thousand in the first nine months of 2018 due to interest income earned on the note receivable during the third quarter of 2019 partially offsetting interest expense. 



Other, net. We recorded other expense of $123 thousand in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $137 thousand in the first nine months of 2018 due to lower foreign exchange losses recorded by our U.K. entity in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018. 



Income Taxes. We recorded an income tax benefit for the first nine months of 2019 of $54 thousand at an effective tax rate of -4.3%, compared to an income tax provision during the first nine months of 2019 of $1.1 million at an effective tax rate of 19.2%. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended 2019 was unusually low and a benefit due to the inclusion of the FDII deduction and the impact of lower pre-tax income. The FDII deduction was not included in the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2018 as the interpretive guidance for the deduction was not yet released. 



Net Income. We reported net income during the first nine months of 2019 of $1.3 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to $4.5 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2018. 



Liquidity and Capital Resources 



Cash Flow 



For the first nine months of 2019, our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $3.5 million, or 74%, from December 31, 2018. We ended the third quarter of 2019 with $1.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $0.2 million was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding. 







  ●  We reported net income of $1.3 million.      



  ●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $0.7 million, and share-based compensation expense of $0.6 million.      



  ●  Accounts receivable increased $0.4 million, or 5%, due to sales for the third quarter 2019 occurring late in the quarter.      



  ●  Inventories decreased by less than 1% due to the utilization of inventory on hand to fulfill sales.      



  ●  Other current and long term assets increased $0.6 million, or 81% due primarily to an advanced payment of royalty fees to a technology partner for restaurant solutions.      



  ●  Accounts payable decreased $0.9 million, or 24%, due to the utilization of inventory on hand to fulfill sales requiring a lower level of inventory purchases during the third quarter of 2019.      



  ●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $0.1 million, or 3%.      





  ●  We reported net income of $4.5 million.      



  ●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $0.7 million, and share-based compensation expense of $0.5 million.      



  ●  Accounts receivable increased $0.8 million, or 7%, due to a large volume of sales made late in the third quarter of 2018 that were collected during the fourth quarter of 2018.      



  ●  Inventories increased $4.2 million, or 47%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales in the casino and gaming and restaurant solutions markets.      



  ●  Prepaid income taxes decreased $0.5 million during the first nine months of 2018.      



  ●  Accounts payable increased $2.5 million, or 65%, due to increased inventory purchases made during the third quarter of 2018.      



  ●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $0.3 million, or 8%, due primarily to the payment of 2017 annual bonuses in March 2018, partially offset by increased deferred revenue.      







Capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs for the full year 2019 are expected to be approximately $1.3 million, primarily for software development for our new restaurant solutions BOHA! products, new product tooling, new computer software and equipment purchases. 





Credit Facility and Borrowings 



We maintain a credit facility (the “TD Bank Credit Facility”) with TD Bank N.A. (“TD Bank”), which provides for a $20 million revolving credit line. On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022. Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all our assets. We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line. The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12.5 million from $10 million. 







At September 30, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under the TD Bank Credit facility. Following the waiver, we had borrowings available under the TD Bank Credit Facility of $20 million. 



Shareholder Dividend Payments 



In 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the Board’s approval each quarter. Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017. Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $0.7 million or $0.09 per share in the third quarter of both 2019 and 2018. On October 31, 2019, our Board of Directors approved the fourth quarter 2019 dividend in the amount of $0.09 per share payable on or about December 16, 2019 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on November 20, 2019. We expect to pay approximately $2.7 million in cash dividends to our common shareholders during 2019. Dividends declared and paid totaled $2 million, or $0.27 per share, for both the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. 



Stock Repurchase Program 



On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”). Under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors. The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue the repurchase program prior to such time. We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account. Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we repurchased no shares of our common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we repurchased 156,410 shares of our common stock for approximately $2 million at an average price per share of $12.78. 





Resource Sufficiency 



We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our expected cash flows generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our TD Bank Credit Facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, and dividend payments, and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. 





The disclosure of payments we have committed to make under our contractual obligations is set forth under Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations since December 31, 2018.
