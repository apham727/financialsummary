 Item 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES      



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 



Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2019. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 



At the time that (i) our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 was filed on March 18, 2019, (ii) our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 was filed on May 10, 2019, and (iii) our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 was filed on August 8, 2019, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2018, March 31, 2019, and June 30, 2019, respectively. Subsequently, our management, including our CEO and CFO, reevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2018, March 31, 2019, and June 30, 2019, and continue to not be effective as of September 30, 2019 due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. 



Notwithstanding these material weaknesses, our management, including our CEO and CFO, has concluded that our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and our condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, as previously filed with the SEC, and the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with GAAP for each of the periods presented, and that they can still be relied upon. 



We will be amending our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 to reflect the conclusion by management that our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2018. 





Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 



We identified the following control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019. We also determined that these material weaknesses existed as of December 31, 2018, March 31, 2019, and June 30, 2019. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 



 ●  We did not design and maintain effective controls over user access within the Company’s ERP system, Oracle, to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user access to appropriate personnel. Specifically, the provisioning and user recertification controls are not designed to ensure users maintain proper segregation of duties and therefore could have inappropriate access rights (the “Access Control Weakness”).     



 ●  We did not design and maintain effective controls over the completeness and accuracy of information included in key spreadsheets supporting our accounting records (the “Spreadsheet Control Weakness”).     



The control deficiencies constituted material weaknesses, but did not result in a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 (or any of the condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarters included therein), or to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019, and September 30, 2019. However, if these material weaknesses are not remediated, a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures may not be prevented, and may go undetected, which could result in a material misstatement of future annual or interim consolidated financial statements. 



Remediation Efforts to Address Material Weaknesses 





 ●  To address the Access Control Weakness, we are utilizing the services of an Oracle consulting firm and an accounting firm unrelated to PwC, to assist us in analyzing and reviewing Oracle access for all users. Upon completion of this analysis, we plan to modify the designated Oracle responsibilities for each employee for which a conflict has been identified to remove any Oracle transactional responsibilities that we believe are conflicting and reassign those responsibilities to a different employee to ensure proper segregation of duties. In addition, we plan to enhance and implement provisioning and user certification controls to ensure we maintain the appropriate segregation of duties within Oracle following the analysis.     



 ●  To address the Spreadsheet Control Weakness, for each key spreadsheet using Oracle data, we plan to evaluate and determine (1) if a standard Oracle report exists containing the same information as the spreadsheet, and if so, we would utilize the standard Oracle report (without modification) instead of the spreadsheet to support our accounting records and (2) if a standard Oracle report cannot be used, we will implement a new key control whereby an employee performs a formal validation that the information from Oracle is completely and accurately transferred (automatically or manually) to a spreadsheet by verifying totals and other information on a test basis. For all other key spreadsheets, we plan to design and implement a new key control to validate completeness and accuracy of information supporting our accounting records.     



We believe these steps will address the material weaknesses described above. 



Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 



No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
