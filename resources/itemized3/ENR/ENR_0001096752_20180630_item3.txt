Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.



The market risk inherent in our financial instruments and positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. At times, we enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) to reduce these exposures. For further information on our foreign currency derivative instruments, see Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As of June 30, 2018, there were no open derivative or hedging instruments for future purchases of raw materials or commodities. Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our variable-rate debt instruments, which currently bear interest based on LIBOR plus margin. As of June 30, 2018, our outstanding variable-rate debt included $185.0 on our term loan. Assuming a one-percent increase in the applicable interest rates, annual interest expense on these variable-rate debt instruments would increase by approximately $1.9.



There have been no material changes in our assessment of market risk sensitivity since our presentation of "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on November 20, 2017.
