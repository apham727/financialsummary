Cash Flows and Liquidity - Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $159.8 million at June 30, 2019 as compared to $251.2 million at September 30, 2018. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $91.5 million was primarily attributable to net cash outflows of $442.7 million to acquire GENEWIZ, cash dividends paid of $21.7 million and capital expenditures of $15.5 million, partially offset by net cash inflows primarily from proceeds received in connection with the amendment and syndication of our incremental term loan of $331.4 million, proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $51.5 million and net cash inflows from operating activities of $58.2 million as of June 30, 2019. Cash inflows from operating activities of $58.2 million was comprised of $76.6 million of net earnings, including net income of $25.1 million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $51.5 million, partially offset by uses of cash of $18.4 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions. 



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES



Our unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. The preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets other than goodwill, long-lived assets, derivative financial instruments, deferred income taxes, warranty obligations, revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method, pension obligations and stock-based compensation expense. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions, both in general and specifically in relation to the semiconductor and life science industries, that serve as a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily determinable based on information from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions that could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.



For further information with regard to our significant accounting policies and estimates, please refer to Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



Three and Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended June 30, 2018



Revenue 



We reported revenue of $203.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $172.4 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $31.5 million, or 18%. We reported revenue of $581.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $471.9 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $109.7 million, or 23%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting guidance for recognizing revenue on a modified retrospective basis. The difference in reported revenue due to the 



adoption of the standard was a net decrease of $0.9 million and $2.4 million during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. 



Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported revenue of $116.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $122.7 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, a decrease of $6.6 million, or 5%. We reported a decline in automation systems revenue of $13.0 million and services revenue of $1.0 million, which were partially offset by an increase in contamination control systems of $7.3 million. For the nine months ended June 30, 2019, our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported revenue of $341.6 million compared to $326.2 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $15.4 million, or 5%. We reported an increase in contamination control solutions of $35.7 million, of which $15.1 million is attributable to six additional months of revenue for the acquisition of Tec-Sem, acquired on April 1, 2019, this was partially offset by declines in automation systems of $19.1 million and services of $1.2 million. The semiconductor markets are cyclical and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Demand for our Brooks Semiconductor Solution Group products is affected by these cycles. The difference in reported revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net increase of $0.2 million and $0.8 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.



Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported revenue of $87.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $49.7 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $38.1 million, or 77%, was composed of $37.1 million from acquisitions, and $1.1 million from internal growth, driven by increases in sales of BioStoreTM III Cryostores, sample storage services, infrastructure services, and consumables and instruments, partially offset by declines in automated cold storage systems. For the nine months ended June 30, 2019, our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported revenue of $240.0 million, compared to $145.7 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $94.3 million, or 65% was composed of $86.3 million from acquisitions, and $8.0 million from internal growth, principally in sample storage services, consumables and instruments, infrastructure services, and BioStoreTM III Cryostores, partially offset by declines in automated cold storage systems and informatics solutions. The difference in reported revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net decrease of $1.0 million and $3.3 million during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. 



Revenue generated outside the United States was $115.7 million, or 57% of total revenue, for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $110.7 million, or 64% of total revenue, for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Revenue generated outside the United States was $342.4 million, or 59% of total revenue, for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $298.0 million, or 63% of total revenue, for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. We had no customers that accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue for each of the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. 



Gross Margin



We reported gross margins of 41.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 38.8% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin increased in the Brooks Life Sciences Segment by 3.6 percentage points and in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment by 1.6 percentage points in the 2019 period over the 2018 period. We reported gross margins of 40.6% for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 38.9% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin increased in the Brooks Life Sciences segment by 3.7 percentage points and in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group by 0.1 percentage points in the 2019 period over the 2018 period. Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 also included $0.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting, as compared to $0.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Excluding the purchasing accounting impact related to inventory step-up and the amortization of completed technology, gross margins expanded 2.3 percentage points and 1.9 percentage points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The difference in reported gross margin due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net decrease in gross profit of $0.4 million and $0.9 million during three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. 



Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported gross margins of 40.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 39.3% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is driven by 



favorable customer mix and product mix. Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported gross margins of 40.8% for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 39.9% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is driven primarily by customer and product mix and productivity improvements in our services reporting unit. Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 included $0.9 million and $2.7 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $1.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, incurred during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The results for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 included $0.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting as compared to $0.8 million during both the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Excluding the purchase accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 0.8 percentage points, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The difference in reported gross margin due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net increase in gross profit of $0.2 million and $0.8 million during three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.



Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported gross margins of 41.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 37.4% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported gross margins of 40.3% for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 36.6% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase during both periods was due to a higher margin revenue mix from GENEWIZ. Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 included $2.0 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $0.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, incurred during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The results for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 included $0.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting as compared to no such charges during both the corresponding periods of the current fiscal year. Excluding the purchase accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 5.1 percentage points and 4.2 percentage points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The difference in reported gross margin due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net decrease in gross profit of $0.6 million and $1.8 million during three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.



Research and Development 



Research and development expenses were $14.2 million and $41.5 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $12.0 million and $34.8 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $2.2 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2018 reflects higher expense of $1.2 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment and $1.0 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment. The increase of $6.7 million during the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the same period of fiscal year 2018 reflects higher expense of $3.8 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment and $2.9 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment. Higher expenses in both periods were primarily attributable to new acquisitions, project spending to support new product development and the growth of our business and higher employee related costs. 



Selling, General and Administrative 



Selling, general and administrative expenses were $52.6 million and $158.5 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $42.1 million and $120.7 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $10.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior year was primarily attributable to the selling, general and administrative infrastructure at GENEWIZ, and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of GENEWIZ. These impacts were partially offset by lower expense accruals in the 2019 period as compared to the 2018 period related to variable compensation and lower professional services and merger and acquisition related expenses. The increase of $37.8 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year was driven by selling, general and administrative expenses related to the acquisitions of GENEWIZ and Tec Sem and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in connection with both acquisitions and higher merger and acquisition related expenses, partially offset by lower expenses related to 



professional services and variable compensation as compared to the 2018 period. The nine months ended June 30, 2019 included a $1.1 million credit related to an insurance claim.



Amortization expense related primarily to customer relationships was $6.2 million and $18.6 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $5.1 million and $14.3 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Merger-related costs were $0.2 million and $6.6 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $0.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The increases in amortization expense and merger costs during 2019 are primarily due to the acquisition of GENEWIZ.



Non-Operating Income (Expenses)



Interest income - During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded interest income of $0.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, as compared to $0.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. 



Interest expense - During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded interest expense of $8.0 million and $21.3 million, respectively, as compared to $2.5 million and $6.8 million, respectively, during corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase in interest expense in the 2019 periods compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year are due to interest on the incremental term loan secured in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 to pay a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of GENEWIZ.



Loss on extinguishment of debt - During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $9.1 million in connection with the syndication of the incremental term loan secured during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The syndication to a new group of lenders during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 met the criteria of a debt extinguishment and therefore the amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the origination of the incremental term loan was accelerated and recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt in our statement of operations.



Other expenses, net - During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded other expenses, net of $0.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively, as compared to $0.6 million and $3.0 million, respectively, of the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The $1.9 million decrease during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to lower foreign currency exchange losses.



Income Tax Provision 



We recorded an income tax expense of $7.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019. The tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily driven by a $4.3 million discrete expense resulting from guidance provided with final U.S. tax regulations issued during the quarter related to the transition tax, and the tax provision on current earnings based on estimated annual mix of income by jurisdiction. These expenses were partially offset by a discrete benefit for stock compensation windfalls of $0.4 million for tax deductions that exceeded the associated compensation expense, and a $0.3 million reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit upon the closing of an audit. The tax expense for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily driven by a $3.2 million expense related to the completion of the accounting for the U.S. transition tax and the tx provision on current earnings based on estimated annual mix of income by jurisdiction. These expenses were partially offset by discrete benefits related to stock compensation windfalls of $4.5 million for tax deductions that exceeded the associated compensation expense, and $1.4 million of tax benefits related to the remeasurement of net U.S. deferred tax assets due to state tax rate changes.



We recorded an income tax provision of $5.4 million and benefit of $49.8 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018. The tax provision for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was the result of our earnings for the period. The tax benefit recorded during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily driven by a discrete benefit due to the reversal of a valuation allowance against U.S. net deferred tax assets in the amount of $56.3 



million. The tax benefit for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 also included $0.7 million of tax benefits related to the re-measurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to account for the reduced 21 percent statutory federal income tax rate. These discrete tax benefits for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 were partially offset by the tax provision related to foreign income. 



During 2018, the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations on the federal toll charge and various other aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We finalized our analysis of the toll charge and related liabilities, including uncertain tax positions, during the three months ended December 31, 2018 pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. As a result of the new guidance issued and additional work to complete the calculation of our federal toll charge, we reduced our provisional accrual for federal, state and foreign taxes by net $1.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2018. During the quarter ended June 30, 2019, final U.S. tax regulations were issued that resulted in a $4.3 million increase to the previously calculated transition tax. In addition, we also assessed our uncertain tax positions related to these taxes and accrued income and determined no tax reserves were required.



We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by tax-paying component and assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. We evaluate the profitability of each tax-paying component on a historic cumulative basis and a forward-looking basis while performing this analysis. We evaluated all positive and negative evidence in concluding it was appropriate to release the majority of the valuation allowance against U.S. net deferred tax assets during fiscal year 2018. We maintain a U.S. valuation allowance related to the realizability of other state tax credits and net operating loss carry-forwards. We continue to maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign tax-paying components as of June 30, 2019. On July 1, 2019, we completed the sale of our semiconductor cryogenics business that resulted in a taxable gain in the U.S. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we may record adjustments to our valuation allowance as we consider new evidence including updated forecasts of U.S. income and utilization of deferred tax assets that were previously expected to expire. 



We maintain liabilities for uncertain tax positions. These liabilities involve judgment and estimation and are monitored based on the best information available. We recognize interest related to unrecognized benefits as a component of the income tax benefit. We recognized interest expense related to our unrecognized tax benefits of $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019. During the three months ended June 30, 2019 an income tax audit was closed which resulted in a $0.3 million reduction in the gross unrecognized tax benefits that impacted the effective tax rate. During the nine months ended June 30, 2018 the statute of limitations lapsed on an uncertain tax position in a foreign jurisdiction which resulted in a $0.3 million reduction in the gross unrecognized tax benefits that impacted the effective tax rate.



We are subject to U.S. federal income tax and state, local and international income taxes in various jurisdictions. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file tax returns. In the normal course of business, we are subject to income tax audits in various global jurisdictions in which we operate. The years subject to examination vary for the U.S. and international jurisdictions, with the earliest tax year being 2011. Based on the outcome of these examinations or the expiration of statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized tax benefits could change from those recorded in our unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets. We currently anticipate that it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced by approximately $0.1 million within the next twelve months.



Discontinued Operations



We generated revenue and net income from discontinued operations of $34.5 million and $6.3 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2019 related to our semiconductor cryogenics business as compared to $51.1 million and $17.8 million, respectively, for the corresponding period of fiscal 2018. We generated revenue and net income from discontinued operations of $109.5 million and $20.7 million, respectively, for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 related to our semiconductor cryogenics business as compared to $148.2 million and $37.2 million, respectively, for the corresponding period of fiscal 2018. The net income includes income from the Ulvac Cryogenics, Inc. joint venture during these periods. The income from discontinued operations only includes direct operating expenses incurred that (1) are clearly identifiable as costs being disposed of upon completion of the sale and (2) will not be continued by the 



Company on an ongoing basis. Indirect expenses which supported the semiconductor cryogenics business, and which will remain as part of the continuing operations, are not reflected in income from discontinued operations.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 



A considerable portion of our revenue is dependent on the demand for semiconductor capital equipment which historically has experienced periodic downturns. We believe that we have adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, financing activities, debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. The cyclical nature of our served markets and uncertainty in the current global economic environment make it difficult for us to predict longer-term liquidity requirements with sufficient certainty. We may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on acceptable terms or otherwise, we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance products and services, respond to competitive pressure or take advantage of acquisition opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.



The discussion of our cash flows and liquidity that follows does not include the impact of the disposition of the semiconductor cryogenics business and is stated on a total company consolidated basis.



Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity





​



Our cash is held in numerous locations throughout the world. As of June 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $156.9 million, of which $112.3 million was held outside of the United States. If these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would need to repatriate these funds. As a result of recent changes in U.S. tax legislation, any repatriation in the future would likely not result in further U.S. federal income tax. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current operating plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds for our U.S. operations. As of June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we had marketable securities of $2.9 million and $53.5 million, respectively. Our marketable securities are generally readily convertible to cash without an adverse impact.



On July 1, 2019, subsequent to this third fiscal quarter reporting period, the sale of the semiconductor cryogenics business was completed. Cash received on July 1, 2019 was $669 million, of which, $3 million was placed in escrow. The Company estimates obligations related to the sale include estimated closing costs of $13 million and estimated taxes of $105 million, resulting in estimated net proceeds from the sale of $550 million, subject to final working capital and other adjustments. From the cash received on July 1, 2019 related to the sale, $348.3 million was applied to fully extinguish the balance of our incremental term loan and $147.0 million was applied to reduce the balance outstanding of our term loan. The impact on the cash balance on July 1, 2019 due to the cash received from the sale partially offset by the application of the proceeds received to reduce debt, was a net increase of $173.4 million. The Company expects to settle the other obligations from the sale including estimated closing costs of $13 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, and estimated taxes of $105 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. As described above, the Company routinely invests certain amounts of its cash balance in marketable securities. 



When considering only the cash received related to the sale of the semiconductor cryogenics business and the debt reductions made on July 1, 2019, as mentioned above, the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities reported as of June 30, 2019 on our Consolidated Balance Sheet of $159.8 million increased $173.4 million to $333.2 million. Similarly, the long-term debt reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2019 of $534.7 million 



decreased by $491.8 million on July 1, 2019 to $42.9 million and the current portion of long-term debt reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet of $6.3 million as of June 30, 2019 decreased to $2.8 million on July 1, 2019. Total current liabilities reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2019 of $175.0 million increased on July 1, 2019 by approximately $118 million due to liabilities assumed related to the sale for the estimated tax payments of $105 million and estimated closing costs of $13 million, as mentioned above. 



Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019 Compared to Nine Months Ended June 30, 2018 



Overview



Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $159.8 million at June 30, 2019 as compared to $251.2 million at September 30, 2018. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $91.5 million was primarily attributable to net cash outflows of $442.7 million to acquire GENEWIZ, cash dividends paid of $21.7 million and capital expenditures of $15.5 million, partially offset by net cash inflows primarily from proceeds received from the incremental amendment and syndication of our existing term loan of $331.4 million, proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $51.5 million and net cash inflows from operating activities of $58.2 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2019. 



Operating Activities



Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as earnings, working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and other operating charges impact reported cash flows.



Cash provided by operating activities was $58.2 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2019, comprised primarily of earnings of $76.6 million, including net income of $25.1 million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $51.5 million. Partially offsetting these items were the uses of cash of $18.4 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in a use of cash consisted primarily of a decrease in accrued compensation and tax withholdings as a result of year-end cash incentive bonus payments, an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher revenue, an increase in inventory levels primarily related to our automation systems product lines, and increase in accounts payable. These uses of cash were partially offset by sources of cash related primarily to increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses and other liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities was $42.8 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 comprised primarily of earnings of $95.0 million, including net income of $106.1 million and the unfavorable impact of non-cash related charges of $11.1 million, partially offset by the uses of cash of $52.2 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. 



Investing Activities



Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities as well as cash proceeds generated from sales and maturities of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities was $408.1 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $142.0 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 included cash outflow of $442.7 million for the acquisition of GENEWIZ, $15.5 million of capital expenditures, and $1.3 million for the purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by cash inflows from the proceeds of sales and maturities of marketable securities of $51.5 million. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 included cash payments of $83.0 million for acquisitions, $58.3 million for the purchases of marketable securities and $9.3 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by cash inflows from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $8.5 million.



Financing Activities



Cash provided by financing activities was $309.8 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $176.4 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Cash provided by financing activities during 



the nine months ended June 30, 2019 included net cash inflows of $331.4 million primarily related to net proceeds from the incremental term loan secured in November 2018 and the syndication of the incremental term loan in February 2019, partially offset by cash dividend payments of $21.7 million. Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 included cash inflows of $197.6 million related to proceeds from the term loan originated in October 2017, partially offset by cash dividend payments of $21.2 million and principal payments of $1.0 million. 



China Facility



In April 2019, we committed to construct a facility in Suzhou China, to consolidate the Suzhou operations of its GENEWIZ business and provide an infrastructure to support future growth. The facility will be constructed in two phases. We expect to incur $50.0 to $55.0 million of capital expenditures related to this facility over the next five years, of which up to $10.0 million is expected to be incurred during 2019. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, we have incurred $0.1 million in capital expenditures related to the construction of this facility. 



Divestiture and Extinguishment of Debt



On July 1, 2019, we completed the sale of our semiconductor cryogenics business to Edwards Vacuum LLC (a member of the Atlas Copco Group) for $675.0 million. We expect net cash proceeds from the sale to be approximately $550 million, after adjustments and deducting taxes and other items. On July 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the sale, we used $348.3 million of the cash proceeds from the sale to extinguish the total remaining outstanding balance of the incremental term loan and $147.0 million of the cash proceeds from the sale to extinguish a portion of the outstanding balance of the term loan. The total amount of debt extinguished on July 1, 2019 was $495.3 million.

Capital Resources



Senior Secured Term Loan Facility 



On October 4, 2017, we entered into a $200.0 million term loan with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. The term loan was issued at $197.6 million, or 98.8% of its par value, resulting in a discount of $2.4 million, or 1.2%, which represented loan origination fees paid at the closing. On November 15, 2018, we entered into an incremental amendment, or the Amendment to the existing credit agreement. Under the Amendment, we obtained an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million. The proceeds of the incremental loan were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of GENEWIZ acquisition. The term loan was issued at $340.5 million, or 97.3% of its par value, resulting in a discount of $9.5 million, or 2.7%, which represented financing cost of the loan. Except as provided in the Amendment, the incremental loan is subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the existing credit agreement. The loan principal amount may be increased by an aggregate amount equal to $75.0 million plus any voluntary repayments of the term loans plus any additional amount such that the secured leverage ratio of the Company is less than 3.00 to 1.00. 



On February 15, 2019, we syndicated the incremental term loan to a group of new lenders which met the criteria of a debt extinguishment. We wrote off the carrying value of the incremental term loan of $340.1 million as of February 15, 2019 and recorded the syndicated incremental term loan at its present value for $349.1 million and a loss on debt extinguishment for $9.1 million. The syndicated incremental term loan was issued at $345.2 million, or 98.9% of its part value resulting in a discount of $4.0 million which represented financing costs which are presented as a reduction of the incremental term loan principal balance in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets and was accreted over the life of the loan. Except as provided in the Amendment for increase of interest rates, the incremental term loan was subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the incremental term loan.



The term loans mature and becomes fully payable on October 4, 2024. Installment principal payments equal to 0.25% of the initial principal amount of the term loan are payable on the last day of each quarter, with any remaining principal amount becoming due and payable on the maturity date. During the nine months ended June 30, 2019, we made principal payments of $3.3 million related to the term loans. Subject to certain conditions stated in the credit agreement, we may redeem the term loans at any time at our option without a significant premium or penalty, except for 



a repricing transaction, as defined in the original credit agreement and the Amendment. We would also be required to redeem the term loan at the principal amounts then outstanding upon the occurrence of certain events, as set forth in the original credit agreement and the Amendment. 



On July 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the sale of our semiconductor cryogenics business, we used $348.3 million of the cash proceeds from the sales to extinguish the outstanding balance of the incremental term loan and $147.0 of the cash proceeds from the sales to extinguish a portion of the outstanding balance of the term loan. The total amount of debt extinguished on July 1, 2019 was $495.3 million. At July 1, 2019, our total outstanding debt balance was approximately $46 million as a result of the debt extinguishment.



In connection with the GENEWIZ acquisition, we assumed three five-year term loans and two one-year term loans. At June 30, 2019, we had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $1.7 million for the three five-year term loans. The two one-year short term loans matured and were repaid in full as of June 30, 2019. 



At June 30, 2019, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the term loans was $541.1 million, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs of $5.8 million. Borrowings under the term loan bear variable interest rates. As a result, we may experience exposure to interest rate risk due to the potential volatility associated with the variable interest rates on the term loan. If rates increase, we may be subject to higher costs of servicing the loan which could reduce our profitability and cash flows. During the nine months ended June 30, 2019, the weighted average stated interest rate on the term loan was 5.4%. During the nine months ended June 30, 2019, we incurred aggregate interest expense of $21.3 million on the term loans including $1.3 million of deferred financing costs amortization. Our debt service requirements are expected to be funded through our existing sources of liquidity and operating cash flows. 



The credit agreement and the Amendment contain certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default. As of June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions under the credit agreement.



Line of Credit



Facility 



We maintain a revolving line of credit under a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that provides for revolving credit facility of up to $75.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability, as defined in the credit agreement. The line of credit matures on October 4, 2022. The proceeds from the line of credit are available for permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes. 



As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately $48.7 million available for borrowing under the line of credit. There were no amounts outstanding pursuant to the line of credit as of June 30, 2019. The amount of funds available for borrowing under the credit agreement may fluctuate each period based on our borrowing base availability. The credit agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, a financial covenant, affirmative and negative covenants, as well as events of default. We were in compliance with the credit agreement as of June 30, 2019. Although we believe we will be able to generate sufficient cash in the United States and foreign jurisdictions to fund future operating costs, we secured the revolving line of credit as an additional assurance for maintaining liquidity in the United States during potentially severe downturns of the cyclical semiconductor market, and for strategic investments or acquisitions. 



Dividends



On July 31, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share payable on September 27, 2019 to common stockholders of record as of September 6, 2019. Dividends are declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend on actual cash flow from operations, our financial condition, debt service and capital requirements, and any other factors our Board of Directors may consider relevant. We intend to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future; however, the amount and timing of these dividends may be impacted by the cyclical nature 



of certain markets we serve. We may reduce, delay or cancel a quarterly cash dividend based on the severity of a cyclical downturn.



Share Repurchase Program



On September 29, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for up to $50.0 million worth of our common stock. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be based on market and business conditions, legal requirements and other factors and repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time at our discretion. There were no shares repurchased under this program during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 and there have been no shares repurchased under this program since its inception.



Contractual Obligations and Requirements



Our non-cancellable inventory purchase commitments were $97.2 million at June 30, 2019. 



At June 30, 2019, we had approximately $1.3 million of letters of credit outstanding related primarily to customer advances and other performance obligations. These arrangements guarantee the refund of advance payments received from our customers in the event that the product is not delivered or warranty obligations are not fulfilled in accordance with the contract terms. These obligations could be called by the beneficiaries at any time before the expiration date of the particular letter of credit if we fail to meet certain contractual requirements. None of these obligations were called during the nine months ended June 30, 2019, and we currently do not anticipate any of these obligations to be called in the near future.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 



As of June 30, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
