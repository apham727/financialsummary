Forward Looking Statements and Projections  



This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward looking statements. Forward looking statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. We generally identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may, will, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other similar words. These statements are only predictions. We have based these forward looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The outcome of the events described in these forward looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in Risks Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as those described in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, you should not rely upon forward looking statements as predictions of future events. We cannot assure you that the events and circumstances reflected in the forward looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. The forward looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Sources of Revenue  





Some of our revenue streams, particularly project-related and custom font design service revenue where spending is largely discretionary in nature, have historically been, and we expect them to continue to be in the future, susceptible to weakening economic conditions.  







For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 55.4% and 53.7%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 55.7% and 57.7%, respectively, of our total revenue. We expect that sales to international customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our products worldwide.  



We derive a significant portion of OEM revenue from a limited number of customers, in particular manufacturers of laser printers and consumer electronic devices. For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 23.8% and 29.3% of total revenue, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately 22.2% and 30.0% of total revenue, respectively. Although no one customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for the three months or six months ended June 30, 2018 or 2017, if we are unable to maintain relationships with major customers or establish relationships with new customers, our licensing revenue will be adversely affected.  



Creative Professional Revenue

OEM Revenue  



For a description of our OEM revenue and related accounting policy, see Note 4.  





Table of Contents 



Cost of Revenue  



Our cost of revenue consists of font license fees that we pay on certain fonts that are owned by third parties, personnel and allocated internal engineering expense and overhead costs related to custom font design services and SaaS based offerings and cloud-based web service costs. License fees that we pay to third parties are typically based on a percentage of our Creative Professional and OEM revenue and do not involve minimum fees.  



Cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquired technology, which we amortize over 7 to 15 years. For purposes of amortizing acquired technology, we estimate the remaining useful life of the technology based upon various considerations, including our knowledge of the technology and the way our customers use it. We use the straight-line method to amortize acquired technology. There is no reliable evidence to suggest that we should expect any other pattern of amortization than an even pattern, and we believe this best reflects the expected pattern of economic usage.  



Gross Profit  



Our gross profit percentage is influenced by a number of factors including product mix, pricing and volume at any particular time. However, cost of OEM revenue is typically lower than cost of Creative Professional revenue because we own a higher percentage of the fonts licensed to OEM customers, provide value-added technology and have negotiated lower royalty rates on the fonts we license from third parties because of volume. In addition, within our Creative Professional business, the cost of custom font design and SaaS based service revenue is substantially higher than the cost of other revenue. The relative cost of Creative Professional revenue has decreased in recent periods, as efforts to sell license rights to more fonts that we own have been successful, and because we have recently experienced success in our effort to sell certain license rights that carry lower royalty rates to Creative Professional customers. Creative Professional revenue is growing at a faster rate than OEM revenue. We expect these trends to continue. Our gross profit is subject to variability from period-to-period, depending on the product mix and the level of custom font design and SaaS based service revenue.  



Critical Accounting Policies  



The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  



Information about our critical accounting policies may be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading Critical Accounting Policies, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, except for the adoption as of January 1, 2018, of guidance in ASC 606 as more fully described in Note 3 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated quarterly statements.  



Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2017  







License revenue increased primarily due to the growth in sales to enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic product offering. This growth was partially offset by decreases due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the second quarter of 2017, as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts. There was no corresponding item in the current period. In addition, our royalty based revenue is lower in the three months ended June 30, 2018, as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We now estimate and accrue royalty-based revenue in the quarter when the royalty-based units are shipped, as opposed to when those shipments were reported to us by the licensee under legacy GAAP.  





Table of Contents 



Service revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue due primarily to the growth of SaaS-based offerings. Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, is unchanged at 84.9%, period over period. Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, increased to 78.7% from 71.2%. See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.  



While revenue from services has grown to a level of significance requiring separate disclosure, we continue to operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.  







The following discussion compares the three months ended June 30, 2018 with the three months ended June 30, 2017.

Revenue by Market  







Revenue  



Revenue was $60.7 million and $57.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $2.9 million, or 5.0%.  



Creative Professional revenue increased $7.8 million, or 25.4%, to $38.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $30.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, mainly due to growth in sales to enterprise customers, including our new Mosaic solution, and increased service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our portfolio.  



OEM revenue decreased $4.9 million, or 18.0%, to $22.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from $27.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to lower revenue from customers under fixed fee contracts and partially due to $2.4 million of one-time payments recognized in the second quarter of 2017 from the conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts. There was no corresponding item in the current period.  



Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit  



Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was $10.0 million and $10.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1.8%. As a percentage of sales, cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was 16.4% and 17.6% of total revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, is primarily due to lower costs associated with our enterprise sales business.  



The portion of cost of revenue consisting of amortization of acquired technology was unchanged at $0.9 million for both the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.  



Gross profit in the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased 1.3 percentage points to 82.2% of sales in the second quarter of 2018, as compared to 80.9% of sales in the same period in 2017, mainly due to improved margins in our enterprise sales business, partially offset by the continued mix shift between Creative Professional and the higher margin OEM business.  



Operating Expenses  



Marketing and Selling. Marketing and selling expense was $20.1 million and $22.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 11.6%. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $2.2 million, period over period, due to lower headcount mainly from restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2017. Software expenses increased $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, mainly due to investments in information systems supporting the Creative Professional business. Targeted marketing spending decreased $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, due to portfolio decisions around discretionary programs.  



Research and Development. Research and development expense was $8.5 million and $9.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 8.4%, mainly due to lower personnel expenses. Personnel expenses decreased $0.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, due to lower headcount from restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2017. Outside consulting expense decreased $0.2 million period over period, mainly due to timing of projects.  





Table of Contents 



General and Administrative. General and administrative expense was $11.9 million in both the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Personnel expenses decreased in the second quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to lower recruitment costs, which was mostly offset by increased depreciation expense, mainly due to the capitalization of internally developed software.  



Restructuring. Restructuring expense was $6.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018. There was no restructuring expense in the same period in 2017. Included in restructuring costs is a $3.2 million write down of the intangible assets and goodwill allocated to the Swyft business, which was discontinued in connection with the restructuring action announced in June 2018. Severance expenses totaled $4.0 million and an acceleration of Swyft deferred compensation payment resulted in an incremental charge of $0.5 million due to the restructuring action in the second quarter of 2018. These charges were partially offset by a $1.4 million reversal of stock based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan. There were no similar charges in the same period in 2017.  



Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets was unchanged at $1.0 million for both three month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.  



Interest Expense, Net  



Interest expense, net of interest income was $0.8 million and $0.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.1 million, mainly due to increases in interest rates on our outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a reduction in the balance outstanding.  











Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes  





      The statutory tax rate in the three months ended June 30, 2018 is 21.0%, as compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0% in the same period in 2017.  



      Foreign rate differential increased our effective rate 40.1% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to a decrease of 1.0% in the same period in 2017, due to changes in tax treatment of foreign earnings under The Act. These changes include significant new limitations on the ability to utilize foreign tax credits, and the effects of the new Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions. These provisions have resulted in a significantly higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings.  



      Non-deductible expenses added 3.1% to the effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to 43.1% in the same period in 2017, primarily due to changes in the deductibility of officer compensation under The Act, partially offset by the reduction in the statutory rate and a decrease in non-deductible acquisition-related compensation expense for the period.

Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2017  







License revenue increased primarily due to growth in sales to our enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic product offering. This growth was partially offset by decreases due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the six months ended June 30, 2017, as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts. There was no corresponding item in the current period. In addition, our royalty based revenue is lower in the six months ended June 30, 2018, a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We now estimate and accrue our royalty-based revenue in the quarter when the royalty-based units are shipped, as opposed to when those shipments were reported to us by the licensee under legacy GAAP. This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017.  



Service revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue due primarily to the growth of our SaaS-based product offerings. Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased to 82.0% from 84.7%. These decreases are primarily due to additional non-recurring royalty expense in the six months ended June 30, 2018 for which there was no corresponding revenue in the corresponding period in 2017, in accordance with ASC 606. Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, increased to 76.5% from 73.7%. See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.  



While revenue from services has grown to a level of significance requiring separate disclosure, we continue to operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.

The following discussion compares the six months ended June 30, 2018 with the six months ended June 30, 2017.  



Revenue by Market.  







Revenue  



Revenue was $117.4 million and $110.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $7.1 million, or 6.4%.  



Creative Professional revenue increased $15.7 million, or 27.2%, to $73.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $57.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, mainly due to growth in sales of revenue from our enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic solution and higher service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our offering portfolio.  





Table of Contents 



OEM revenue decreased $8.6 million, or 16.4%, to $43.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $52.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to lower revenue from customers under fixed fee contracts and partially due to $4.1 million of one-time payments recognized in the six months ended June 30, 2017 from the conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts. There was no corresponding item in the current period. Additionally, we recorded lower royalty based revenue as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We now estimate and accrue royalty-based revenue in the quarter when the royalty-based units are shipped, as opposed to when those shipments were reported to us by the licensee under legacy GAAP. This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017.  



Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit  



Cost of revenue excluding amortization of acquired technology increased $3.5 million, or 18.4%, to $22.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $18.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in cost of revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2018 is mainly due to $2.2 million of additional non-recurring royalty expense for which there was no corresponding revenue item in the period in accordance with ASC 606. As a percentage of sales, cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was 19.1% and 17.2% of total revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  



Amortization of acquired technology was $1.7 million and $1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 2.0%.  



Gross profit was 79.5% and 81.2% of sales in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of 1.7 percentage points. The decrease in gross profit in the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, was partially due to the additional non-recurring royalty expense as described above, and partially offset by the continued mix shift between Creative Professional and the higher margin OEM business.  



Operating Expenses  



Marketing and Selling. Marketing and selling expense decreased $3.8 million, or 8.6%, to $40.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $44.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $3.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, mainly due to a reduction in headcount from the restructuring action in the fourth quarter of 2017. Software expenses increased $1.0 million in the first half of 2018 mainly due to investments in information systems supporting the Creative Professional business than in the prior period. Targeted marketing spending decreased $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, due to portfolio decisions around discretionary marketing programs. Facilities expense decreased $0.3 million mainly due to the consolidation of certain regional offices in 2017.  



Research and Development. Research and development expense was $17.8 million and $18.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 5.5%. Personnel and consulting expenses together decreased $0.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to a reduction in headcount from the restructuring action in the fourth quarter of 2017 and timing of projects. Decreased facilities expense contributed $0.3 million to the overall decrease period over period, due to the consolidation of certain regional offices in 2017.  



General and Administrative. General and administrative expense increased $4.7 million, or 20.8% to $27.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $22.7 million in the same period in 2017. Outside consulting and legal expenses increased $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to additional expenses incurred related to shareholder activities. Personnel expenses increased $0.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, mainly the result of key hiring. Increased infrastructure expenses, such as software expenses and depreciation, together contributed $0.9 million to the overall increase in general and administrative expenses, period over period.  



Restructuring. Restructuring expense was $6.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. There was no restructuring expense in the same period in 2017. Included in restructuring costs is a $3.2 million write down of intangible assets and goodwill allocated to the Swyft business, which was discontinued in connection with the restructuring action announced in June 2018. Severance expenses totaled $4.2 million and an acceleration of Swyft deferred compensation payment resulted in an incremental charge of $0.5 million mainly due to the restructuring action in the second quarter of 2018. These charges were partially offset by a $1.4 million reversal of stock based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan. There were no similar charges in the same period in 2017.  



Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets was unchanged at $2.0 million for the six month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  





Table of Contents 



Interest Expense, Net  



Interest expense, net of interest income was $1.5 million and $1.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.1 million, as reductions in outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit were offset by an increase in interest rates.  











Provision for Income Taxes  





      The statutory tax rate in the six months ended June 30, 2018 is 21.0%, as compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0% in the same period in 2017.  



      Foreign rate differential increased our effective rate 26.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to a decrease of 2.3% in the same period in 2017, due to changes in tax treatment of foreign earnings under The Act. These changes include significant new limitations on the ability to utilize foreign tax credits, and the effects of the new Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions. These provisions have resulted in a significantly higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings.  



      Non-deductible expenses added 14.2% to the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to 33.4% in the same period in 2017, primarily due to changes in the deductibility of officer compensation under The Act, partially offset by the reduction in the statutory rate and a decrease in non-deductible acquisition-related compensation expense for the period.  



In addition, a net windfall on stock based compensation resulted in a 9.2% increase in the effective rate for the first half of 2018, as compared to a shortfall rate in the same period in 2017 that resulted in a 20.1% reduction in the effective rate.   



Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  



Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements may be found in Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  



Liquidity and Capital Resources  



Cash Flows for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017  



Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, private and public stock sales and long-term debt arrangements, as described below. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. At June 30, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $75.8 million and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility, of which there was $85.0 million of outstanding borrowings. Our liquidity and cash flows in the six months ended June 30, 2017, included share purchases made under a share repurchase program, which ended on December 31, 2017. On May 3, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock, which permits purchases through June 7, 2019. In the six months ended June 30, 2018, we used $1.0 million in cash to purchase shares under the plan. Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the operations of our existing business, our potential strategic expansion and future acquisitions we might undertake.

Operating Activities  



We generated $3.3 million in cash from operations during the six months ended June 30, 2018. Net loss, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred financing costs and accretion of interest, loss on retirement of fixed assets, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes and unrealized currency loss on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $9.3 million in cash. The non-cash impairment of Swyft related intangible assets added back $3.2 million.  



Accrued expenses and accounts payable used $9.9 million, inclusive of large non-recurring payments of deferred compensation of $7.0 million, additional royalty payments resulting from the adoption of ASC606 of $2.1 million and payment of investor relations advisor fees of $2.2 million. In addition we paid 2017 accrued variable compensation, offset by additional restructuring accruals. Decreased deferred revenue and increased accounts receivable generated $5.6 million in cash, primarily a result of customer payments received, net of an increase in unbilled receivables due to the adoption of ASC 606. Increased prepaid expense and other assets used $4.0 million in cash, mainly due to an increase in long term unbilled receivables and capitalized contract costs related to the adoption of ASC 606. Accrued income taxes used $1.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018.  



Variations in operating cash flows occur from time-to-time, because our enterprise customers make upfront payments on subscription revenue. These payments are required under the terms of our license agreements and can cause large fluctuations in accounts receivable and deferred revenue. The timing and extent of such payments may significantly impact our cash balances.  



We generated $12.4 million in cash from operations during the six months ended June 30, 2017. Net loss, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred financing costs and accretion of interest, loss on retirement of fixed assets, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes, and unrealized currency loss on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $13.4 million in cash. Decreased accrued expenses and accounts payable used $2.5 in cash, primarily a result of the payment of 2016 accrued variable compensation. Increased deferred revenue and decreased accounts receivable, offset by increased prepaid expense generated $0.4 million in cash, mainly due to timing. Accrued income taxes generated $1.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017.  



Investing Activities  



During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we used $2.3 million in investing activities mainly for the purchase of property and equipment. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we used $3.6 million in investing activities mainly for the purchase of property and equipment.  



Financing Activities  



Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $16.7 million. We received cash from exercises of stock options of $3.4 million. We paid cash dividends of $9.6 million and we paid $8.0 million on our outstanding revolving line of credit. We also purchased $1.0 million of treasury stock in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and paid $1.5 million in employee taxes on shares withheld in the six months ended June 30, 2018. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $17.4 million. We received cash from exercises of stock options of $0.7 million.

On July 25, 2018 the Companys Board of Directors declared a $0.116 per share quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The record date is set for October 1, 2018 and the dividend is payable to shareholders of record on October 19, 2018. We anticipate this to be a recurring quarterly dividend with future payments and record dates, subject to board approval.  



Credit Facility  



On September 15, 2015, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement) by and among the Company, the Companys subsidiary, Monotype Imaging Inc., any financial institution that becomes a Lender (as defined therein) and Silicon Valley Bank, as agent which provides for a five-year $150.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility permits the Company to request that the Lenders, at their election, increase the secured credit facility to a maximum of $200.0 million. The Credit Facility is available to the Company on a revolving basis through September 15, 2020. Repayment of any amounts borrowed is not required until maturity of the Credit Facility; however, the Company may repay any amounts borrowed at any time, without premium or penalty. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear a variable rate not less than zero based upon, at the Companys option, either LIBOR or the higher of (i) the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, and (ii) 0.5% plus the overnight federal funds rate, plus in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for LIBOR loans, based on the applicable leverage ratio, is 1.25%, 1.50% or 1.75% per annum, and the applicable margin for base rate loans, based on the applicable leverage ratio, is either 0.25%, 0.50% or 0.75%% per annum. At June 30, 2018, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.8% for LIBOR, and at December 31, 2017, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.1% for LIBOR. The Company had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $85.0 million at June 30, 2018, and $93.0 million at December 31, 2017. The Credit Facility has $0.5 million reserved for one stand-by letter of credit in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $64.5 million and $56.5 million available for borrowing at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  











Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP profitability measures such as income (loss) from operations and net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure has material limitations since it excludes the statement of income impact of depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, net, the provision (benefit) for income taxes and stock based compensation and therefore

    does not represent an accurate measure of profitability, particularly in situations where a company is highly leveraged or has a disadvantageous tax structure. We have significant intangible assets and amortization expense is a meaningful element in our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from Adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation. We have a significant amount of debt, and interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and therefore its exclusion from Adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation. We generally incur significant U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes each year and the provision for income taxes is a necessary element of our costs and therefore its exclusion from Adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation. We have stock based compensation and the associated expense has a meaningful impact on our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from Adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation. Non-cash expenses, restructuring, issuance and cash non-operating expenses have a meaningful impact on our financial statements. Therefore, their exclusion from Adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income (loss) for complete analysis of our profitability, as net income (loss) includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable GAAP operating performance measure to Adjusted EBITDA. As Adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of the limitations that Adjusted EBITDA has as an analytical tool, investors should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP.  



The Credit Facility also contains provisions for an increased interest rate during periods of default. We do not believe that these covenants will affect our ability to operate our business, and we were in compliance with all covenants under our Credit Facility as of June 30, 2018.  



Non-GAAP Measures  



In our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls, in addition to Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above, we discuss a key measure that is not calculated according to GAAP. This non-GAAP measure is net adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock based compensation expense and acquisition-related compensation. We use net adjusted EBITDA as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business. We use net adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our board of directors, determining bonus compensation for our employees based on operating performance and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations. We believe that net adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period-to-period without direct correlation to underlying operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. We believe that trends in our net adjusted EBITDA may be valuable indicators of our operating performance.  



In our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls, in addition to Adjusted EBITDA and net adjusted EBITDA as discussed above, we discuss another key measure that is not calculated according to GAAP. This non-GAAP measure is non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, which is defined as earnings per diluted share before amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock based compensation expenses and acquisition-related compensation. We use non-GAAP earnings per diluted share as one of our principal indicators of the operating performance of our business. We use non-GAAP earnings per diluted shares in internal forecasts, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our board of directors and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations. We believe that non-GAAP earnings per diluted share permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period-to-period without direct correlation to underlying operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. We believe that trends in our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share may be valuable indicators of our operating performance.  



In March 2018, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share to exclude the impact of one-time non-recurring expenses, such as certain advisor fees, royalty expenses and restructuring expenses. This change more accurately reflects managements view of the Companys business and financial performance.
