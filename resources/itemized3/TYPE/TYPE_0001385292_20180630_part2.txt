Part IIOTHER INFORMATION  



Item 1. Legal Proceedings  



From time-to-time, we may be a party to various claims, suits and complaints. We do not believe that there are claims or legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  



 Item 1A. Risk Factors  



Except as noted below, there are no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  



We conduct a substantial portion of our business outside North America and, as a result, we face diverse risks related to engaging in international business.  



We have offices in seven foreign countries and we are dedicating a significant portion of our sales efforts in countries outside North America. We are dependent on international sales for a substantial amount of our total revenue. In 2017 and 2016, approximately 56.9% and 58.3%, respectively, of our total revenue was derived from operations outside the U.S. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, 55.4% and 55.7%, respectively, of our total revenue was derived from operations outside of the U.S. and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. This future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our type and technologies, including the licensing of our solutions worldwide.  





      our ability to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent that the United States does, which increases the risk of unauthorized and uncompensated use of our type or technologies;  



      United States and foreign government trade or tariff restrictions, including those that may impose restrictions on importation of programming, technology or components to or from the United States;  



      foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon us in the United States, and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the United States;  



      risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, in particular fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen, the European Unions euro, and the United Kingdoms pound sterling, including risks related to hedging activities we may undertake;  



      foreign labor laws, regulations and restrictions;  



      changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including the United Kingdoms decision to leave the European Union, as well as related events;  



      difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;  





      the strength of international economies, including consideration of high inflation rates.
