Consolidated Operating Results



The following discussion of operating results provides an overview of our operations by addressing key elements in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The “Segment Operating Results” section that follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated revenue and earnings from operations. Given the nature of our business, we believe revenue and earnings from operations (including operating margin percentage) are most relevant to an understanding of our performance at a segment level. Additionally, at the segment level we disclose backlog, which represents orders received for products or services for which a sales agreement is in place and delivery is expected within twelve months. Backlog is not an absolute indicator of future revenue because a portion of the orders in backlog could be canceled at the customer's discretion. While the backlog is subject to order cancellations, we have not historically experienced a significant amount of order cancellations. 



Revenue. Consolidated revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019, increased by 6.5 percent year over year, from $452.7 million in the second quarter of 2018 to $482.0 million in the second quarter of 2019. Consolidated revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased by 3.9 percent year over year, from $892.3 million in the first six months of 2018 to $926.7 million in the first six months of 2019. Increases in revenues for the three month period was primarily driven by increases in our Government and Defense business unit which is partially attributed to the acquisitions of Aeryon Labs Inc. ("Aeryon") and Endeavor Robotics Holdings Inc. ("Endeavor") during the first quarter of 2019 coupled with volume increases of unmanned solutions and surveillance systems. Increases in revenues for the sixth month period were primarily driven by increases in our Government and Defense business unit as noted above, partially offset by declines in our Commercial business unit as a result of the divestiture of the Consumer and Small and Medium-sized ("SMB") Security businesses as announced in February 2018 and volume declines in the Maritime and Outdoor and Tactical Systems ("OTS") businesses. 



The timing of orders, scheduling of backlog, and fluctuations in demand in various regions of the world can give rise to quarter to quarter and year over year fluctuations in the mix of revenue. Consequently, year over year comparisons for any given quarter may not be indicative of comparisons using longer time periods. We currently expect total annual revenue for 2019 to be higher than 2018 revenue, however, unexpected changes in economic conditions from key customer markets or other major unanticipated events may cause total revenue, and the mix of revenue between our segments, to vary from quarter to quarter during the year.



International sales accounted for 44.2 percent and 48.4 percent of total revenue for the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The proportion of our international revenue compared to total revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to normal variation in order activity across various regions as well as specific factors that may affect one region and not another. Overall, we anticipate that revenue from international sales will continue to comprise a significant percentage of total revenue.



Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $248.4 million and $459.5 million compared to cost of goods sold for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 of $220.2 million and $441.9 million. The increase in cost of goods sold for the three month period is partially attributed to the acquisitions of Aeryon and Endeavor coupled with volume increases of unmanned solutions and surveillance systems. The increase in cost of goods sold for the six 





month period is primarily driven by the Government and Defense business unit for the same reasons noted for the three month period, partially offset by declines in our Commercial business unit as a result of the divestiture of the Consumer and SMB Security businesses in the first quarter of 2018 and volume declines in the Maritime and OTS businesses.



Gross profit. Gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, was $233.6 million compared to $232.6 million for the same quarter last year. Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $467.3 million compared to $450.5 million for the six month period ended June 30, 2018. Gross margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, decreased from 51.4 percent in the second quarter of 2018 to 48.5 percent in the second quarter of 2019 and remained flat at 50.4 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 50.5 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in gross margin for the three month period was primarily due to the change in product mix in our Government and Defense business unit due to the acquisitions as noted above, as well as the increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets recorded during the period. 



Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2019 totaled $53.0 million, compared to $46.4 million in the second quarter of 2018. Research and development expenses for the first six months of 2019 were $101.0 million compared to $91.0 million for the first six months of 2018. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were 11.0 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 10.3 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue for the first six months of 2019 were 10.9 percent and 10.2 percent during the first six months of 2018. We have, and will continue to have, fluctuations in quarterly spending depending on product development needs and overall business spending priorities and believe that annual spending levels are most indicative of our commitment to research and development. Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2018, our annual research and development expenses have varied between 8.5 percent and 9.9 percent of revenue, and we currently expect these expenses to remain within that approximate range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.



Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $116.9 million and $97.5 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $221.4 million and $205.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. The increases in selling, general, and administrative expenses year over year is primarily attributed to acquisition related expenses for acquisitions occurring in the first half of 2019 and consent agreement related costs. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense during the first six months in 2019 compared to the first six months in 2018 is primarily attributed to acquisition related expenses for acquisitions occurring in the first half of 2019 and consent agreement related costs partially offset by the $15 million regulatory settlement that was recorded in the first quarter of 2018. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 24.2 percent and 21.5 percent for the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 23.9 percent and 23.0 percent for the six month periods ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. Over the past five annual periods through December 31, 2018, our annual selling, general and administrative expenses have varied between 19.4 percent and 21.8 percent of revenue, and excluding the impact of the $15.0 million regulatory settlement cost described above, we currently expect these expenses to remain within that approximate range, on an annual basis, for the foreseeable future.



Loss on sale of business. During the first quarter of 2018, we recorded an additional pre-tax loss on the sale of our Consumer and SMB Security businesses of $10.2 million. See Note 20, "Business Acquisitions and Divestitures," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.



Interest expense. Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2019, was $7.3 million, compared to $4.0 million for the same period of 2018. Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $12.8 million, compared to $8.0 million for the same period of 2018. Interest expense for the three and six month period in 2019 was primarily associated with the $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes and interest on amounts drawn under our credit facility. Interest expense for the same periods in 2018 were primarily associated with the $425 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes. 



Income taxes. Our income tax provision of $12.0 million and $25.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, represents an effective tax rate of 20.7 percent and 18.8 percent. Our income tax provision for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was $11.4 million and $26.8 million, which represented an effective tax rate of 13.7 percent and 19.5 percent. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 is lower than the United States Federal tax rate of 21 percent mainly due to a reduction in previously non-deductible interest expense and excess tax benefits from stock compensation, offset partially by state taxes, higher tax rates applied to income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions, and other discrete items.







reassessment are not in accordance with Swedish tax regulations and plan to defend our positions with the STA and through the Swedish court system, as necessary. Consequently, no adjustment to our unrecognized tax benefits has been recorded in relation to this matter. 



Segment Operating Results



The Company is currently organized into three reportable segments. The three reportable segments continue to be the Industrial business unit, Government and Defense business unit and the Commercial business unit. See Note 19, “Operating Segments and Related Information,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of each operating segment, including the types of products and services from which each operating segment derives its revenues. 



Industrial







Industrial business unit revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 was flat compared to the same period of 2018. Industrial business unit revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased by 2.6%, compared to the same period of 2018. The increase in revenue for the six month period was predominately attributable to strong growth across the cooled cores product lines partially offset by declines in the Instruments and Integrated Imaging Systems (IIS) businesses. The increases in earnings from operations and corresponding operating margin for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2019, compared to the same periods of 2018, were predominately attributable to favorable product mix led by the OEM business and productivity initiatives to improve manufacturing efficiency and decrease product costs across all divisions. The decline in backlog as of June 30, 2019 when compared to the backlog at June 30, 2018 is primarily attributed to increased shipments of one large aerospace and defense customer as well as uncooled products in addition to the timing of orders which can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer purchasing timetables.



Government and Defense







Government and Defense business unit revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 increased by 22.7 percent compared to the same period of 2018. Government and Defense business unit revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased by 15.8 percent compared to the same period of 2018. The increase in revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2019, compared to the same periods of 2018, was primarily driven by the Aeryon and Endeavor acquisitions during the first quarter of 2019 and increased volumes of UAS products and surveillance systems. Earnings from operations are only up slightly for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods of 2018 while operating margins declined for the same periods due to the inclusion of the operating losses from the same acquisitions noted above. See Note 20, "Business Acquisitions and Divestitures," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The increase in 





year-over-year backlog is primarily driven by the first quarter of 2019 acquisitions as noted above in addition to the timing of orders and subsequent timing of deployment of major programs. 



Commercial







Commercial business unit revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 decreased by 7.4 percent compared to the same period of 2018. Commercial business unit revenue for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 decreased by 11.9 percent compared to the same period of 2018. The decrease in both revenue and earnings from operations and corresponding operating margin for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 is primarily attributed to volume declines in our Maritime and OTS businesses. The decrease in both revenue and earnings from operations and corresponding operating margin for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 is also attributed to volume declines in those same businesses as well as the divestiture of our Consumer and SMB Security business during the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in year-over-year backlog is partially attributed to volume declines in the Maritime and OTS businesses. Additionally, there was an international order in current backlog as of June 30, 2018, which was moved to non-current backlog in late 2018 and subsequently canceled.



Liquidity and Capital Resources



At June 30, 2019, we had a total of $268.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, $70.8 million of which resided in the United States and $198.1 million at our foreign subsidiaries, compared to cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018, of $512.1 million, of which $327.0 million resided in the United States and $185.1 million at our foreign subsidiaries. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the six months ended June 30, 2019, was primarily due to cash used for business acquisitions of $602.5 million, common stock repurchases of $50.0 million, dividend payments of $46.1 million, a minority interest investment of $5.0 million and capital expenditures of $17.8 million, partially offset by cash provided from operations of $123.3 million, net proceeds of $345.0 million from our revolving credit facility and long-term debt, and proceeds of $17.4 million from shares issued under our stock compensation plans.



Cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2019 totaled $123.3 million, which primarily consisted of net earnings, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, other non-cash items and changes in working capital. The decrease of cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to changes in working capital balances driven by increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable as well as a decrease in net income in the period.



Cash used by investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 totaled $622.3 million, which consisted primarily of business acquisitions, a minority interest investment and capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business.



Cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 totaled $255.4 million, which primarily consisted of cash provided from net proceeds from our revolving credit facility and long-term debt, and proceeds from shares issued under our stock compensation plans, partially offset by repurchases of shares of our common stock and the payment of quarterly dividends.



On March 29, 2019, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., U.S. Bank National Association, Citibank, N.A., MUFG Union Bank, N.A., and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company's existing Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 31, 2016 ("Existing Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for a $650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, a $100.0 million unsecured term loan facility available in U.S. dollars amortizing at 5.000 percent per annum, and a $150.0 million unsecured term loan facility available in Swedish kronor amortizing at 5.000 percent per annum. The Credit Agreement has a term of five years and matures on March 29, 2024. In connection with the closing of the Credit Agreement, we made an initial borrowing of $100.0 million in revolving loans, $100.0 million in term loans in U.S. dollars, and the equivalent 





of $150.0 million in term loans in Swedish kronor. Additionally we repaid in full all outstanding amounts, consisting of revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of $375.0 million, under the Existing Credit Agreement.



We have the right, subject to certain conditions, including approval of additional commitments by qualified lenders, to increase the availability under the revolving credit facility by an additional $200.0 million until March 29, 2024. The Credit Agreement allows us and certain designated subsidiaries to borrow in United States dollars, European euros, Swedish kronor, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, and other agreed upon currencies. Interest rates under the Credit Agreement fluctuate depending on the type and tenor of the borrowing, with the most common being a Eurocurrency rate loan based on the published Eurocurrency rate (e.g. LIBOR) in which the loan is denominated. Interest rates under the Credit Agreement are governed based on the type and tenor of the borrowing and includes Eurocurrency rate loans based on the published Eurocurrency rate (e.g. LIBOR) in which the loan is denominated. The Eurocurrency rate loans have a floor of zero percent and an applicable margin that ranges from 1.0 percent to 1.375 percent depending on the Company’s consolidated total leverage ratio. At June 30, 2019, the borrowing rate on the revolving loan was 3.652 percent per annum, the borrowing rate on the U.S. dollar term loan was 3.569 percent per annum and the borrowing rate on the Swedish kronor term loan was 1.250 percent per annum. The Credit Agreement requires us to pay a commitment fee on the amount of unused revolving commitments at a rate, based on our consolidated total leverage ratio, which ranges from 0.125 percent to 0.200 percent of unused revolving commitments. At June 30, 2019, the commitment fee on the amount of unused revolving credit was 0.175 percent per annum. The Credit Agreement contains one financial covenant that requires maintenance of a consolidated total leverage ratio with which we were in compliance at June 30, 2019. The credit facilities available under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. The Credit Agreement also contains language providing for the adoption of a LIBOR successor rate consistent with market practice. 



To manage the interest rate risk arising from the variability in interest expense attributable to amounts drawn under the Swedish kronor term loan, we entered into a floored amortizing interest rate swap with a Swedish kronor notional amount initially equivalent to $150.0 million. The interest rate swap was designated, and effective, as cash flow hedges.



We had $8.8 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement at June 30, 2019, which reduced the total availability under the revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement.



In June 2016, we issued $425.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2021 (the “Notes”). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $421.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, which are being amortized over a period of five years. Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on December 15 and June 15. The proceeds from the Notes were used to repay our 3.750 percent senior unsecured notes that were due September 1, 2016, and are being used for general corporate purposes, which include working capital and capital expenditure needs, business acquisitions, and repurchases of our common stock.



On February 8, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. This authorization expired on February 8, 2019. On February 7, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. This authorization will expire on February 7, 2021. As of June 30, 2019, a total of approximately 1.0 million shares have been repurchased under the February 7, 2019 authorization. 



As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company has accrued income tax liabilities of $42.9 million related to the transition tax enacted on December 22, 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Of the amounts accrued, none are expected to be due within one year. The remaining transition tax will not accrue interest and will be paid in annual installments beginning in 2020 through 2024.



We have not provided United States, state or foreign income taxes for earnings generated after January 1, 2018 by certain subsidiaries outside the United States as we currently intend to reinvest the earnings in operations and other activities outside of the United States indefinitely. Should we subsequently elect to repatriate such foreign earnings, we would need to accrue and pay state and foreign income taxes, thereby reducing the amount of our cash. United States taxes would generally not be payable due to changes made by the Tax Act. 





We believe that our existing cash combined with the cash we anticipate generating from operating activities, and our available credit facilities and financing available from other sources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve 





months. We do not have any significant commitments nor are we aware of any significant events or conditions that are likely to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



As of June 30, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.



Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements





Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Readers should refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis and the critical accounting policies and its use of estimates as reported in Note 1, "Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 14, "Contingencies" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management's estimates. There have been no significant changes in the Company's assumptions regarding critical accounting estimates during the first six months of 2019.



Contractual Obligations



There were no material changes to the Company's contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of its business during the quarter ended June 30, 2019, other than the $100 million borrowed under the revolving credit facility and $250 million borrowed under the term loan facility and related interest under the Credit Agreement, as described above in "Liquidity and Capital Resources."



Contingencies



See Note 17, "Contingencies," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the disclosure of certain matters by the Company to the United States Department of State Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance, communications to the Company from the United States Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security, and the Company's current estimates of the range of potential loss associated with quality concerns identified by the Company regarding certain SkyWatch Surveillance Towers.





ITEM 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS







All share repurchases are subject to applicable securities law, and are at times and in amounts as management deems appropriate. These repurchases were through open market transactions under the authorization by our Board of Directors on February 7, 2019 to repurchase of up to 15.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. This authorization will expire on February 7, 2021.
