 1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies  



 Basis of Presentation  



 The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of TE Connectivity Ltd. (“TE Connectivity” or the “Company,” which may be referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) have been prepared in United States (“U.S.”) dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) and the instructions to Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In management’s opinion, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of interim results. The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire fiscal year or any subsequent interim period.  



 The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018.  



 Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 are to our fiscal years ending September 27, 2019 and ended September 28, 2018, respectively.  



 Revenue Recognition  



 We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which introduced a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model. Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract, such as a purchase order with a customer, are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control. We transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers, the customers accept and have legal title for the product, and we have a right to payment for such product. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations, we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities. Our credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient of ASC 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations as of March 29, 2019. See Note 15 for net sales disaggregated by industry end market and geographic region which is summarized by segment and that we consider meaningful to depict the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows affected by economic factors.  



 We generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time. We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the price of the defective product. We do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations.  



 Although products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly. Our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of

 TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.  



 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)





the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us.  



 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  



 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02 which codified ASC 842, Leases. This guidance, as subsequently amended, requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for most leases and is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are currently in the process of updating policies, internal controls, financial statement disclosures, and systems to incorporate the impact of the new standard in our financial reporting processes. We intend to adopt the standard using the optional transition method permitted by ASU No. 2018-11, which allows for application of the standard at the adoption date and no restatement of comparative periods. We expect that adoption will likely have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet; however, we currently do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. We believe that we are following an appropriate timeline to allow for the proper recognition, reporting, and disclosure of leases upon adoption of ASC 842 at the beginning of fiscal 2020.  



 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  



 In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, an update to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The update improves and simplifies hedge accounting and related disclosures. We elected to early adopt this update, which did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in the quarter ended December 28, 2018.  



 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, an update to ASC 740, Income Taxes. This guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory in the period in which the transfer occurs. The update was adopted on a modified retrospective basis in the quarter ended December 28, 2018 and resulted in a $443 million cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings, which represented the net reversal of all balances associated with deferred tax impacts of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This included a decrease in other assets of $798 million, an increase in deferred tax assets of $418 million, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $63 million on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  



 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 which codified ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This guidance supersedes ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and introduces a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model. ASC 606 also enhances disclosures related to revenue recognition. We adopted ASC 606, as amended, in the quarter ended December 28, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. Transition impacts, which relate primarily to incentive compensation arrangements, were not material to our results of operations or financial position. Because the impact of adoption was immaterial, we have not recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings.  



 2. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net  









 Table of Contents  



 TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.  



 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)















 During fiscal 2019, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements impacting all segments. In connection with this program, during the six months ended March 29, 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $107 million. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during the six months ended March 29, 2019 by the end of fiscal 2021 and to incur additional charges of approximately $20 million primarily in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments.  





 During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments. In connection with this program, during the six months ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018, we recorded restructuring charges of $5 million and $35 million, respectively. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2018 by the end of fiscal 2020 and to incur additional charges of approximately $10 million primarily in the Industrial Solutions segment.

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)







 Prior to fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting all segments. Also prior to fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment. During the six months ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018, we recorded net restructuring charges of $5 million and $9 million, respectively, related to pre-fiscal 2018 actions. We expect additional charges related to pre-fiscal 2018 actions to be insignificant.  



 Total Restructuring Reserves  









 During the six months ended March 29, 2019, we sold our Subsea Communications (“SubCom”) business for net cash proceeds of $297 million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $86 million, related primarily to the recognition of cumulative translation adjustment losses of $67 million and the guarantee liabilities discussed below. The SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and was reported as such in all periods presented on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the SubCom business was included in the Communications Solutions segment.  



 In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business’ projects that existed as of the date of sale. These guarantees had a combined value of approximately $1.7 billion as of March 29, 2019 and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025; however, the majority are expected to expire within two years. At the time of sale, we determined that the fair value of these guarantees was $12 million, which we recognized by a charge to pre-tax loss on sale. Also, under the terms of the definitive agreement, we are required to issue up to $300 million of new performance guarantees, subject to certain limitations, for projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale for a period of up to three years. During the six months ended March 29, 2019, we issued a guarantee of $70 million for a new project. We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on any SubCom guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform.

 (1) At March 29, 2019 and September 28, 2018, accumulated impairment losses for the Transportation Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Communications Solutions segments were $2,191 million, $669 million, and $489 million, respectively.   



 6. Intangible Assets, Net  







 Intangible asset amortization expense was $45 million for the quarters ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018 and $90 million for the six months ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018.  









 During the six months ended March 29, 2019, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our 100%-owned subsidiary, issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due June 2020. The notes bear interest at a rate of three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 0.45% per year. The notes are TEGSA’s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)





 During the six months ended March 29, 2019, TEGSA repaid, at maturity, $325 million 2.375% senior notes due 2018.   



 TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with total commitments of $1,500 million. The Credit Facility was amended in November 2018 primarily to extend the maturity date from December 2020 to November 2023. The amended Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to $500 million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at March 29, 2019 or September 28, 2018.  



 As of March 29, 2019, TEGSA had $360 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.63%. TEGSA had $270 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.35% at September 28, 2018.  



 The fair value of our debt, based on indicative valuations, was approximately $4,172 million and $4,149 million at March 29, 2019 and September 28, 2018, respectively.  



 8. Commitments and Contingencies  



 Legal Proceedings  



 In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non‑income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  



 Environmental Matters  



 We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. As of March 29, 2019, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $14 million to $44 million, and we accrued $17 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  



 Guarantees  





 At March 29, 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $307 million.   



 We sold our SubCom business during the six months ended March 29, 2019. In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to honor certain performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business. See Note 3 for additional information regarding these guarantees and the divestiture of the SubCom business.

 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  



 During fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of €1,000 million to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans. Under the terms of these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, we make interest payments in euros at 3.50% per annum and receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 5.33% per annum. Upon the maturity of these contracts in fiscal 2022, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in euros and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties. In connection with the cross-currency swap contracts, both counterparties to each contract are required to post cash collateral.  







   (1)    Gains and losses excluded from the hedging relationship are recognized prospectively in selling, general, and administrative expenses and are offset by losses and gains generated as a result of re-measuring certain intercompany loans to the U.S. dollar. 



 Hedge of Net Investment  



 During fiscal 2019, we expanded our cross-currency swap program to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations. The aggregate notional value of the fiscal 2019 contracts was $1,901 million at March 29, 2019. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 3.00% per annum and pay no interest. Upon the maturity of these contracts at various dates through fiscal 2023, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in the designated foreign currencies and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties.  



 In addition to the cross-currency swap program, we hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany loans and external borrowings denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $3,415 million and $4,064 million at March 29, 2019 and September 28, 2018, respectively.

 (1) Foreign currency exchange gains and losses on intercompany loans and external borrowings are recorded as currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and are offset by changes attributable to the translation of the net investment.   



 (2) Gains and losses on cross-currency swap contracts designated as hedges of net investment are recorded as currency translation.  











 The components of net periodic pension benefit cost other than service cost are included in net other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  



 During the six months ended March 29, 2019, we contributed $19 million to our non-U.S. pension plans.

 TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.  



 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)







 We recorded income tax expense of $91 million and $108 million for the quarters ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018, respectively. The income tax expense for the quarter ended March 29, 2019 included $15 million of income tax expense associated with the tax impacts of certain legal entity restructurings and intercompany transactions, partially offset by a $12 million income tax benefit resulting from lapses of statutes of limitations in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. The income tax expense for the quarter ended March 30, 2018 included a $17 million income tax benefit resulting from lapses of statutes of limitations in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.  



 We recorded income tax expense of $169 million and $707 million for the six months ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018, respectively. The income tax expense for the six months ended March 29, 2019 included $15 million of income tax expense associated with the tax impacts of certain legal entity restructurings and intercompany transactions. The income tax expense for the six months ended March 30, 2018 included $567 million of income tax expense related to the tax impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) and a $61 million net income tax benefit related to certain legal entity restructurings. During the quarter ended December 29, 2017, the period of enactment of the Act, we were required to revalue our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at a U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21% and we recorded income tax expense of $567 million primarily in connection with the write-down of our U.S. federal deferred tax asset for net operating loss and interest carryforwards. Included in the expense of $567 million was an income tax benefit of $34 million related to the reduction in the existing valuation allowance recorded against certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards.  



 Although it is difficult to predict the timing or results of our worldwide examinations, we estimate that approximately $130 million of unrecognized income tax benefits, excluding the impact relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months.   



 We are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 29, 2019.  



 Tax Sharing Agreement  



 Under a Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International plc (“Tyco International”), and Covidien plc (“Covidien”) share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to the collective income tax returns for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. As a result of subsequent transactions, Tyco International and Covidien now operate as part of Johnson Controls International plc and Medtronic plc, respectively. We have substantially settled all U.S. federal income tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service for periods covered under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Certain shared U.S. state and non-U.S. income tax matters remain open. We do not expect these matters will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
