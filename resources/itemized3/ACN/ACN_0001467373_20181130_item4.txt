ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 



Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 



Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 



While we implemented internal controls to ensure we adequately evaluated our contracts and properly assessed the impact of FASB ASU No. 2014-09 (Topic 606) on our financial statements, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
