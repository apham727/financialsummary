Executive Overview



Founded in 1927, Littelfuse is a global manufacturer of leading technologies in circuit protection, power control and sensing. Sold in over 150 countries, the Company’s products are found in automotive and commercial vehicles, industrial applications, data and telecommunications, medical devices, consumer electronics and appliances. With its broad product portfolio of fuses, semiconductors, polymers, ceramics, relays and sensors, and extensive global infrastructure, the Company’s worldwide associates partner with its customers to design, manufacture and deliver innovative, high-quality solutions for a safer, greener and increasingly connected world.





Executive Summary



For the first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized net sales of $405.5 million compared to $417.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 representing a decrease of $12.3 million, or 2.9%. The decrease was primarily driven by $9.9 million or 2.4% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and decreased volume in the passenger car and automotive sensors businesses within the Automotive segment, partially offset by higher volumes in the semiconductor business in the Electronics segment as result of the IXYS acquisition completed on January 17, 2018. The Company recognized net income of $37.0 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to net income of $36.0 million, or $1.45 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in net income reflects lower non-segment charges compared to prior year primarily due to the IXYS acquisition, partially offset by lower operating income across all segments and foreign exchange losses. 



The Company continues to take actions to improve its cost structure and drive the synergies from the integration of IXYS. The Company expects to realize cost savings from the restructuring activities taken during the first quarter of 2019 including the reorganization of certain manufacturing, selling and administrative functions within the Electronics and Automotive segments. In April 2019, we announced the closure of a European manufacturing facility in the automotive sensor business within the Automotive segment. The Company estimates the restructuring costs associated with this plant closure to be approximately $5.0 million to $7.0 million.



Net cash provided by operating activities was $30.9 million for the three months ended March 30, 2019 as compared to $69.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflected lower earnings and higher working capital levels primarily due to the timing of supplier and customer payments.



During the three months ended March 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 79,916 shares of its common stock totaling $13.6 million. Since September 30, 2018, the Company has repurchased 471,888 shares of its common stock at an average price of $172.62 totaling $81.5 million.



Results of Operations



The following table summarizes the Company’s condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods presented. The first quarter of 2019 includes $5.1 million of non-segment charges, of which $2.7 million of restructuring charges are primarily related to employee termination costs and $2.4 million of acquisition integration charges are primarily related to the IXYS acquisition.



The first quarter of 2018 includes approximately $38.6 million of charges primarily related to the IXYS acquisition, which include $17.9 million of purchase accounting inventory step-up charges, $11.6 million in acquisition-related and integration costs primarily related to legal, accounting and other expenses, $2.5 million in backlog amortization costs, and $4.5 million in stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior service periods and $2.1 million change in control expense related to IXYS. In addition, there were $0.8 million of employee termination costs and $0.1 million of acquisition-related expenses for other contemplated acquisitions.





Net Sales



Net sales decreased $12.3 million or 2.9% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to $9.9 million or 2.4% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, lower volume in the automotive sensors and passenger car businesses within the Automotive segment, partially offset by higher sales in the semiconductor business driven by the IXYS acquisition.



Gross Profit



Gross profit was $155.2 million, or 38.3% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $149.6 million, or 35.8% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to the 2018 IXYS purchase accounting inventory step-up charge of $17.9 million, which negatively impacted the 2018 gross margin by 4.3%, partially offset by lower volume, unfavorable price impacts and product mix within the Electronics and Automotive segments.



Operating Expenses



Total operating expenses were $94.6 million, or 23.3% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $112.1 million, or 26.8% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in operating expenses of $17.5 million is primarily due to lower acquisition and integration related costs of $9.2 million, reduced stock compensation expense of $4.5 million, $2.5 million of backlog amortization expense and $2.1 million of change in control expense related to the IXYS acquisition in 2018.



Operating Income



Operating income was $60.7 million, an increase of $23.1 million, or 61.5%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $37.6 million for the first quarter of 2018. The increase in operating income is due to the $17.9 million purchase accounting inventory step-up charges and the lower operating expenses noted above partially offset by lower operating income across all segments. Operating margins increased from 9.0% in the first quarter of 2018 to 15.0% in the first quarter of 2019 driven by factors mentioned above.



Income Before Income Taxes



Income before income taxes was $46.4 million, or 11.5% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $44.6 million, or 10.7% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before taxes was impacted by foreign exchange losses of $4.2 million during the three months ended March 30, 2019 compared to foreign exchange gains of $10.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018, impairment charges of $2.8 million for certain other investments and a $2.6 million loss on the disposal of a business within the Electronics segment.



Income Taxes



Income tax expense was $9.5 million, or an effective tax rate of 20.3%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $8.6 million, or an effective tax rate of 19.3%, for the first quarter of 2018. The effective tax rates for both periods were lower than the applicable U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to income earned in lower tax jurisdictions.



Segment Results of Operations









Electronics Segment



Net sales increased $1.0 million, or 0.4%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to $10.2 million increase in the semiconductor business due to the IXYS acquisition completed on January 17, 2018, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impact of $5.3 million and lower electronics products volume.



Automotive Segment



Net sales decreased $12.6 million, or 10.0%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to decreased volume in the passenger car and automotive sensors businesses and unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $4.4 million, partially offset by slightly higher volume in the commercial vehicle business. 



Industrial Segment



Net sales decreased slightly by $0.6 million, or 2.4%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to the exit of the Custom business during the second quarter of 2018 and unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $0.2 million, partially offset by higher volume across the power fuse and relay businesses.



Geographic Net Sales Information







Asia-Pacific 



Net sales decreased $6.5 million, or 3.6%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower volume in the passenger car and automotive sensors businesses within the Automotive segment and unfavorable foreign currency impact of $2.6 million, partially offset by higher volume in the semiconductor business within the Electronics segment. 



Americas



Net sales decreased $0.7 million, or 0.5%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to lower volume in the automotive sensors business in the Automotive segment and unfavorable foreign currency impact of $0.3 million, partially offset by higher volume in the semiconductor business within the Electronics segment.



Europe 



Net sales decreased $5.1 million, or 5.1%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency effects of $7.0 million, partially offset by higher volume in the commercial vehicles and automotive sensors businesses within the Automotive segment and higher volume in the semiconductor business within the Electronics segment. 



Liquidity and Capital Resources 



The Company has historically supported its liquidity needs through cash flows from operations. Management expects that the Company’s (i) current level of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, (ii) current and forecasted cash flows from operations, (iii) availability under existing funding arrangements, and (iv) access to capital in the capital markets will provide sufficient funds to support the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, investments, and debt obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.





On March 4, 2016, the Company entered into a five-year credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with a group of lenders for up to $700.0 million. The Credit Agreement consisted of an unsecured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) of $575.0 million and an unsecured term loan credit facility (“Term Loan”) of up to $125.0 million. In addition, the Company had the ability, from time to time, to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan by up to an additional $150.0 million, in the aggregate, in each case in minimum increments of $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions and the agreement of participating lenders.



On October 13, 2017, the Company amended the Credit Agreement to increase the Revolving Credit Facility from $575.0 million to $700.0 million and increase the Term Loan from $125.0 million to $200.0 million and to extend the expiration date from March 4, 2021 to October 13, 2022. The Credit Agreement also includes the option for the Company to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan by up to an additional $300.0 million, in the aggregate, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. Term Loans may be made in up to two advances. The first advance of $125.0 million occurred on October 13, 2017 and the second advance of $75.0 million occurred on January 16, 2018. For the Term Loan, the Company is required to make quarterly principal payments of 1.25% of the original term loan ($2.5 million with the second advance on January 16, 2018) through maturity, with the remaining balance due on October 13, 2022. The Company paid quarterly principle payments of $5.0 million on the term loan during the three months ended March 30, 2019.



Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either LIBOR, fixed for interest periods of one, two, three or six-month periods, plus 1.00% to 2.00%, or at the bank’s Base Rate, as defined, plus 0.00% to 1.00%, based upon the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined. The Company is also required to pay commitment fees on unused portions of the credit agreement ranging from 0.15% to 0.25%, based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement. The credit agreement includes representations, covenants and events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature. The effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the credit facility was 3.75% at March 30, 2019.
