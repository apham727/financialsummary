Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.



Our exposure to market risk relates primarily to the potential change in the British Bankers Association London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). We had $125.1 million of outstanding borrowings under our Amended Credit Facilities with Regions Bank at March 31, 2019. The Amended Term Loan Facility and Amended Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus (1) the Adjusted LIBOR rate for the relevant interest period, (2) an alternate base rate determined by reference to the greatest of (a) the prime lending rate of Regions, (b) the federal funds rate for the relevant interest period plus one half of one percent per annum and (c) the one month LIBOR rate plus one percent per annum, or (3) a combination of (1) and (2). Accordingly, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings under the Amended Credit Facilities. A one hundred basis point change in interest rate on our borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2019 would result in a change in interest expense of approximately $1.3 million annually.



We did not have investments and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks.
