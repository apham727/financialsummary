Gross Profit







Services and software gross margin was lower due to software margin declines across AP and EMEA from a higher volume of lower margin business and increased professional services costs. Services margin was adversely impacted by lower margin in the Americas and AP from lower margin services business in China.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations as of March 31, 2018



DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES







Systems gross margin in the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased primarily as a result of higher purchase accounting adjustments in the prior year of $14.5 and the current year benefit from Brazil indirect tax accrual reversal of $3.7. Deferred Revenue Adjustments included a $5.2 prior year reduction of revenue and $9.3 higher asset amortization.



Operating Expenses









Selling and administrative expense in the three months ended March 31, 2018, decreased $19.1 primarily from cost reduction initiatives as well as lower non-routine charges of $10.6 and restructuring of $7.1. These decreases were partially offset by an unfavorable currency impact of $21.2.



Non-routine costs in selling and administrative expense of $38.5 and $49.1 were included in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The primary components of the non-routine expenses in the first quarter 2018 pertained to purchase accounting adjustments of $23.8 related to intangible asset amortization and integration costs totaling $14.2. Selling and administrative expense included restructuring charges of $1.3 and $8.4 in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.



Research, development and engineering expense in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was flat including an unfavorable currency impact of $4.0. Excluding the impact of currency, research, development and engineering expense decreased primarily from lower restructuring and non-routine integration cost as well as lower software research, development and engineering expense. 



In the three months ended March 31, 2018, the gain on sale of assets was primarily related to the sale of a building in North America of $4.5 and the liquidation of the Barbados operating entity of $3.3. 



Operating expense as a percent of net sales in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 24.6 percent compared with 26.4 percent in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease is related primarily to lower restructuring and non-routine expense inclusive of the previously mentioned gain on sale of a building in North America.



Operating Profit







The operating loss decreased in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due primarily from decreased operating expenses as a result of lower non-routine and restructuring charges.

Other Income (Expense)







The decrease in interest income in the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, was the result of lower average balances and reduced current period rates of short-term investments in Brazil. Interest expense was lower in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same prior-year period due to the favorable impact of refinancing the debt related to the Acquisition. Foreign exchange loss in the three-month period was primarily due to the strengthening of the euro compared to the prior year period.



Net Income (Loss)







Net loss was $63.3 and $52.2 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to the reasons described above and the change in income tax (benefit) expense.



The effective tax rate on the net loss was (44.2) percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The tax expense on the loss is due primarily from impacts of the Tax Act, more specifically, impacts related to GILTI on the estimated annual tax rate. The effective tax rate could vary in future periods based on the Company's earnings before taxes and clarifications around the Tax Act.



The effective tax rate on the net loss was 30.2 percent for the three months ended 2017. Companies are required to apply their estimated annual tax rate on a year-to-date basis in each interim period. Companies should not apply the estimated annual tax rate to interim financial results if the estimated annual tax rate is not reliably predictable. In this situation, the interim tax rate should be based on the actual year-to-date results. As of March, 31, 2017, the Company was not able to reasonably estimate the annual effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2017, because small fluctuations in the Company's earnings before taxes could have resulted in a material change in the estimated annual tax rate. For this reason, the Company did not believe the estimated annual tax rate would provide a reliable estimate and as a result, the Company computed the interim tax rate based on the actual year-to-date results. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily a result of the jurisdictional income (loss) mix and varying statutory rates in the Company's global footprint.

Segment Net Sales and Operating Profit Summary







In the three months ended March 31, 2018, services net sales increased $19.0 or 3.3 percent and included a net favorable currency impact of $39.9 and Deferred Revenue Adjustments of $5.2. Excluding currency and Deferred Revenue Adjustments, net sales decreased $26.1 attributable to lower installation revenue tied to decreased banking systems volumes in the Americas and EMEA.



Segment operating profit decreased $7.4 due to lower gross profit corresponding with systems volume declines in the Americas as a result of lower volume and supply chain delays. Additionally, services operating profit was favorably impacted by higher gross profit on maintenance revenue from increased retail systems volume across all regions while total operating expense was flat between years.





In the three months ended March 31, 2018, software net sales increased $9.1 or 8.2 percent including a net favorable currency impact of $10.2. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales decreased $1.1 primarily related to lower systems volumes in EMEA and AP. This was partially offset by higher banking project volume in the Americas.



Segment operating profit increased $2.1 in the three months ended March 31, 2018 due primarily to lower research, development and engineering expenses. Lower research, development and engineering expense was attributable to higher capitalization of software development and cost reduction initiatives. 





In the three months ended March 31, 2018, systems net sales decreased $66.7 or 15.9 percent, including a net favorable currency impact of $38.5 and Deferred Revenue Adjustments of $5.2. Excluding currency and Deferred Revenue Adjustments, net sales decreased $110.4 from lower combined systems solutions across the Company. EMEA was adversely impacted by lower volume throughout the region and in the Americas, lower volume was a function of supply chain delays. Additionally, AP was adversely impacted by lower volume as previously mentioned in the geographic regions section.



Segment operating loss decreased $21.6 in the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily due to lower gross profit as a function of lower banking systems volume, specifically in the Americas from supply chain delays as well as AP. Operating expenses increased

convert to cash within the year. Accounts payable cash use improved primarily related to reduced spending in EMEA and the Americas.





The most significant changes in adjustments to net income includes increased depreciation and amortization expense and additional share-based compensation. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.5 to $67.1 during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $58.6 during the same period in 2017 primarily due to incremental intangible assets amortization expense related to the finalization of purchase accounting. Share-based compensation increased $6.9 to $13.7 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily due to a change in non-substantive vesting terms of certain awards and an increased number of unvested awards granted. Adjustments to net income also includes (gain) loss on sale of assets, net, which consists primarily of the gains from the sale of a building in North America.



Investing Activities



Net cash provided by investing activities was $39.1 and a use of $29.0 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The maturities and purchases of investments primarily relate to short-term investment activity in Brazil. The proceeds from the sale of assets primarily include cash from the sale of a building in North America. The $68.1 change was primarily due to the utilization of short-term investments in Brazil for cash needs across the organization.



Financing Activities



Net cash used by financing activities was $91.4 and $72.5 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $18.9. The change was primarily due to an additional $35.8 in debt repayments, net of borrowings primarily related to payment of the Revolving Facility and lower cash distributions of $15.2 to noncontrolling interests primarily related to Diebold Nixdorf AG which was paid in March 2017. Refer to note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for details of the Company's cash flows related to debt borrowings and repayments.

The amount available under the Revolving Facility as of March 31, 2018 was $520.0.



The Company has $400.0 aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Notes which are and will be guaranteed by certain of the Company’s existing and future domestic subsidiaries and expire in 2024.



On May 9, 2017, the Company entered into the Incremental Agreement which reduced the initial Term Loan B Facility of a $1,000.0 U.S. dollar-denominated tranche to $475.0. The reduction was funded using the $250.0 proceeds drawn from the Delayed Draw Term Loan A Facility, a replacement of $70.0 with Term Loan B Facility - Euro and previous principal payments.



In connection with the Incremental Agreement, the interest rate with respect to the Term Loan B Facility - USD is based on, at the Company’s option, adjusted LIBOR plus 2.75 percent (with a floor of 0.00 percent) or ABR plus 1.75 percent (with an ABR floor of 1.00 percent) and the interest rate with respect to the Term Loan B Facility - Euro is based on adjusted EURIBOR plus 3.00 percent (with a floor of 0.00 percent).

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various arrangements not recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets that have or could have an effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. The principal off-balance sheet arrangements that the Company enters into are guarantees, operating leases and sales of finance receivables. The Company provides its global operations guarantees and standby letters of credit through various financial institutions to suppliers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers. If the Company is not able to make payment, the suppliers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers may draw on the pertinent bank. Refer to note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details of guarantees. The Company has sold finance receivables to financial institutions while continuing to service the receivables. The Company records these sales by removing finance receivables from the condensed consolidated balance sheets and recording gains and losses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include revenue recognition, the valuation of trade, finance lease receivables, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, guarantee obligations and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, pension and post-retirement benefits and customer incentives, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors. Management monitors the economic conditions and other factors and will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 



Management believes there have been no significant changes during the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the items that the Company disclosed as its critical accounting policies and estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
