Item 4: Controls and Procedures



This quarterly report on Form 10-Q includes the certifications of the Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) required by Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2. This Item 4 includes information concerning the controls and control evaluations referred to in those certifications.



Based on the performance of procedures by management, designed to ensure the reliability of financial reporting, management believes that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented.



Disclosure Controls and Procedures



Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.



In connection with the preparation of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the Company's management, under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2019 due to the material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as described below.



A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 and notes that the material weaknesses were not remediated as of September 30, 2019.



The Company’s risk assessment process was not effective in considering changes to the business operations, personnel and other factors affecting certain financial reporting processes and design of related controls on a timely basis. Accordingly,



•The Company had ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) related to IT systems used for financial reporting by certain entities throughout the organization. The Company did not establish effective IT and financial user access controls commensurate with certain job responsibilities. Consequently, automated and manual process level controls over financial reporting which were dependent upon these ITGCs were also ineffective.



•The Company had ineffective implementation and operation of controls over inventory valuation related to spare parts and finished goods from canceled orders as the Company did not effectively communicate information to certain locations to allow for the effective operations or implementation of these controls.



•The Company had ineffective controls over non-routine transactions as certain controls were not designed at the appropriate level of precision to ensure calculations supporting non-routine transactions were calculated correctly.



Because of the material weaknesses identified above, a reasonable possibility exists that a material misstatement in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

FORM 10-Q as of September 30, 2019







•Improving our continuous risk assessment process to be responsive to changes in the business operations, personnel and IT developments affecting our financial reporting and related controls;



•Improving our timely written communication of changes in financial reporting and related controls affecting both business and financial users;



•Revoking the access to IT systems of those individuals that were identified as inappropriate;





•Implementing consistent inventory valuation controls at all locations and communicating the requirements for effectively operating such controls to all businesses; and



•Implementing controls over calculations associated with non-routine transactions at a more precise level of operation.



Change in Internal Controls





•We performed a full user access review of IT users, and as a result, revoked access that was concluded to be inappropriate;



•We refined our accounting policy and procedures related to inventory valuation, communicated the changes to the impacted finance personnel at our global locations, and conducted training to emphasize and reinforce the changes that were made; and



•We refined our procedures around calculations associated with non-routine transactions, including the related underlying inputs and assumptions utilized in making the calculations.



Further execution of key controls and testing to be conducted through the balance of 2019 and early 2020 will determine whether these changes will prove effective in remediating the respective underlying material weaknesses.



There have been no other changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
