additional product volume in Mexico, Ecuador and Canada as well as additional professional services volume in North America and software license volume in Brazil.





Gross Profit







Services gross margin was relatively flat in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and was favorably impacted by lower restructuring charges of $9.9 and $24.7 in the three and the nine months ended, respectively. Lower non-routine charges of $5.1 and $14.3 in the three and nine months ended, respectively, were primarily related to lower purchase accounting adjustments inclusive of amortization and prior-year quarter deferred revenue. Excluding restructuring and non-routine charges, services gross margin decreased in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 by 1.9 and 2.4 percent, respectively. The three and nine months ended were adversely impacted by an unfavorable banking services mix in North America and higher non-recurring services cost in Brazil banking, primarily in the nine-month period. Additionally, both the three and nine months ended included unfavorable banking customer and services mix in Eurasia, negatively impacting gross margin.



Product gross margin decreased 1.3 percent in the three months ended and was relatively flat in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The three months ended September 30, 2018 was unfavorably impacted by higher restructuring charges of $1.8 while both the three and the nine months ended were favorably impacted by lower non-routine charges of $10.0 and $29.5, respectively. Lower non-routine charges in both the three and nine months ended included decreased Purchase Accounting Adjustments of amortization and prior-year deferred revenue of $10.4 and $24.2 while the nine months ended also benefited $3.7 from the Brazil indirect tax accrual reversal in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding restructuring and non-routine charges, product gross margin decreased 3.1 and 2.3 percent in the three and nine months ended, respectively, primarily as a result of unfavorable banking and retail customer mix in the Americas as well as supply chain delays in the first half of 2018 and the corresponding expedited freight cost.



Software gross margin decreased 5.6 and 3.2 percent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. Restructuring charges were higher by $1.7 and $2.6 in the three and nine months ended, respectively, while non-routine charge were lower by $1.4 and $8.3 in the three and nine months ended, respectively, primarily due to decreased Purchase Accounting Adjustments related to amortization. Excluding restructuring and non-routine charges, software gross margin decreased 6.1 and 5.1 percent in the three and nine months ended, respectively, primarily due to lower margin Latin America licenses net sales. Additionally, the nine months ended was adversely impacted from lower margin professional services in Eurasia.

Operating Expenses









Selling and administrative expense in the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $7.4 including higher incremental restructuring of $25.9 and lower non-routine charges of $8.4. Excluding the impact of restructuring, non-routine charges and a net $4.0 favorable currency impact, mostly related to the Brazil real and euro, selling and administrative expense was $6.1 lower, primarily from lower incentive compensation related to the Company’s annual incentive program (AIP) and initial benefits of the DN Now plan. Selling and administrative expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased $28.7 including higher incremental restructuring of $19.5 and lower non-routine charges of $22.7. Excluding the impact of restructuring and non-routine charges and a net favorable currency impact of $15.1, due to the euro and Brazil real, selling and administrative expense was lower $40.6, primarily from cost reduction initiatives across the Company related to restructuring programs and decreased AIP cost as well as a $4.5 benefit from the mark-to-market adjustment of the legacy Wincor Nixdorf stock option program. The decrease in the nine months ended was partially offset by the retail segment from increased investment in the new North America retail sales organization.



Non-routine cost in selling and administrative expense of $35.3 and $43.7 were included in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The primary components of the non-routine expenses in the third quarter of 2018 pertained to purchase accounting adjustments of $21.7 related to intangible asset amortization, integration cost totaling $9.3 and legal and consulting cost of $4.3. Selling and administrative expense included restructuring charges of $28.6 and $2.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily due to the workforce alignment actions under the DN Now plan. Non-routine cost in selling and administrative expense of $109.9 and $132.5 were included in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The primary components of the non-routine expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 pertained to purchase accounting adjustments of $67.8 related to intangible asset amortization, integration cost totaling $36.8 and legal and consulting cost of $5.1. Selling and administrative expense included restructuring charges of $33.0 and $13.5 in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.



Research, development and engineering expense in the three months ended September 30, 2018 was relatively flat excluding higher restructuring of $1.4. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, research, development and engineering expense included an unfavorable currency impact of $5.3. Excluding the impact of currency, research, development and engineering expense in the nine months ended was flat, primarily from lower AIP cost which was mostly offset by increased restructuring of $2.0.



As a result of certain impairment triggering events, the Company performed an impairment test of goodwill for its four reporting units during the third quarter of 2018. Based on the results of the impairment testing, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $109.3 related to the Eurasia Banking, EMEA Retail and Rest of World Retail reporting units during the third quarter of 2018. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company performed an impairment test of goodwill for all of its LoB reporting units due to the change in its reportable operating segments which resulted in a $90.0 non-cash impairment loss. The nine months ended September 30, 2018 recorded impairment of $199.3, related to the impairment of goodwill in the second and third quarters, compared to $3.1 in the same prior year period related to information technology transformation and integration activities.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations as of September 30, 2018



DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES







No material gain or loss on assets was recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2018. The gain on sale of assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily related to a gain on sale of buildings in North America of $4.8, the liquidation of the Barbados operating entity of $3.3 and gain related to a certain China investment. This gain on sale of assets was partially offset by the loss pertaining to a settlement of certain open matters related to an Americas divestiture in the second quarter of 2018.



Operating expense as a percent of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased 10.3 percent to 32.4 percent compared to the same period in 2017 primarily related the non-cash impairment losses and higher restructuring cost. The nine months ended increased to 29.7 percent compared to 24.0 percent in the same period in 2017 primarily related to the non-cash impairment losses recorded during the second quarter and third quarter of 2018.



Operating Profit







The operating loss increased in the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due primarily to a non-cash goodwill impairment loss along with lower gross profit in all business lines combined with increased restructuring expense. The operating loss increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due primarily to the goodwill impairment in the second and third quarters of 2018 and lower product gross profit in line with decreased volume, partially offset by favorable selling and administrative expense attributable to cost saving initiatives.



Other Income (Expense)







Interest income in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased, compared with the same periods in 2017, primarily as a result of overall lower average balances as well as lower rates on short term investments and repatriation of cash in Brazil. Interest expense in both the three and nine months was higher compared to the same prior-year periods due to higher domestic interest rates and the acquisition of the additional $650.0 of Term Loan A-1 Facility debt with higher incremental interest rates and related fee amortization. Miscellaneous net, increased in the three months ended due primarily to increased income from the strategic alliances in China while the nine months ended was unfavorably impacted by higher cost and lower benefits associated with the company owned life insurance.



Management's Discussion and Analysis of 



Financial Condition and Results of Operations as of September 30, 2018



DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES







Net Income (Loss)







The loss before taxes and net loss increased primarily due to the reasons described above. Net loss was also impacted by the change in the income tax expense (benefit).



The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Company applied the guidance in SAB 118 when accounting for the enactment date effects of the Tax Act. As of September 30, 2018, the Company has not completed the accounting for all the tax effects of the Tax Act. However, upon further analysis of certain aspects of the Tax Act and refinements to the Company’s calculations, the Company has increased the provisional estimate relating to deemed repatriation transition tax (transition tax) by $46.8. This increase in the provisional estimate has been included as a discrete item in the interim period ended September 30, 2018. The Company will continue to refine the provision estimate over the one-year measurement period ending December 31, 2018 which will include the period in which the Company filed its U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return. The final impacts of the Tax Act may differ materially as additional guidance and information becomes available and the U.S. federal tax filing, including transition tax, is complete.



The effective tax rate on the loss before taxes was (26.5) percent for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and (9.3) percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The expense on the loss for the three months ended and nine months ended was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge, the impacts of the Tax Act and the higher interest expense burden resulting from the debt restructuring. More specifically, the expense on the loss reflects refinement of the transition tax, the impacts related to GILTI and the business interest deduction limitation which, as a result of the Company’s debt restructuring activities during the quarter, required a full valuation allowance on the current year nondeductible business interest expense. In addition, the benefit on the losses for the nine months is reduced by the goodwill impairment charge, which for tax purposes is primarily nondeductible, of $109.3 and $90.0 incurred in the third and second quarter, respectively. The effective tax rate could vary in future periods based on the Company’s earnings before taxes and clarification around the Tax Act.



The effective tax rate on the loss before taxes was 3.0 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 36.2 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The tax for the three months ended September 30, 2017 reflects an unfavorable adjustment relating to year-to-date changes in the Company’s valuation allowance as well as higher than anticipated losses incurred in jurisdictions with a full valuation allowance throughout the period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, the overall reduction in the tax benefit was offset by the repatriation of foreign earnings and the associated recognition of foreign tax credits as well as favorable discrete items associated with the release of uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and reductions in the Company’s deferred tax liability relating to undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings.

Segment Net Sales and Operating Profit Summary







In the three months ended September 30, 2018, Eurasia Banking net sales decreased $26.8 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $11.5 mainly related to the euro. Net sales in the prior-year quarter were adversely impacted $5.8 related to Deferred Revenue Adjustments. Excluding currency and Deferred Revenue Adjustments, net sales decreased $21.1 due primarily to India from a roll off of a low-margin maintenance services contract with a particular customer. Additionally, lower product volume primarily in AP was partially offset by increased unit replacements in Germany related to Windows 10 migrations. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, Eurasia Banking net sales decreased $65.7 including a net favorable currency impact of $61.7 to the euro. Net sales in the prior-year were adversely impacted $18.3, including a net favorable currency impact of $1.4, related to Deferred Revenue Adjustments. Excluding currency and Deferred Revenue Adjustments, net sales decreased $147.1 due to lower product volume in various countries throughout the segment related to fewer product deployments and projects, particularly in Turkey, Indonesia, Australia and the Middle East, in addition to decreased services in India as a result of a maintenance contract roll off with a particular customer. These decreases were partially offset by increased unit replacements in Germany related to Windows 10 migrations. 



Segment operating profit increased $3.2 in the three months and decreased $11.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the prior-year same periods. The three months ended operating profit increased primarily due to lower operating expense from lower AIP cost and the workforce alignment actions under the DN Now plan as well as higher software volume and associated profit. The increase was partially offset by lower services and product gross profit from decreased service base in AP and unfavorable services customer and solution mix in EMEA as well as unfavorable solutions mix in the Eurasia non-core business. The nine months ended was unfavorably impacted by lower gross profit attributable to lower product volume and service base loss in AP, as well as lower product volume and unfavorable services mix in the non-core business. Decreased selling and administrative and research, development and engineering expense partially offset lower gross profit in the nine months ended from a combination of lower AIP expense and cost saving initiatives related to the restructuring programs.



Segment operating profit margin increased in the three months ended primarily as a result of lower operating expense, related to lower AIP cost and cost saving initiatives, as well as higher software gross profit, partially offset by lower services and product gross profit. The nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased compared to the prior-year same period due to decreased product and services gross profit, partially offset by favorable selling and administrative expense attributable to lower AIP cost and cost saving initiatives.





In the three months ended September 30, 2018, Americas Banking increased $5.8 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $7.9 related to the Brazil real. Excluding currency, net sales increased $13.7 from higher product volume in Brazil, Canada, U.S. national accounts and Mexico, partially offset by lower product volume in U.S. regional accounts. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, Americas Banking net sales decreased $41.9 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $13.6 related to the Brazil real. Excluding currency, net sales decreased $28.3 due to lower product volume in Brazil as well as the North America regional business, which was adversely impacted by supply chain delays in the first half of 2018. Additionally, service revenue

was impacted by lower maintenance revenue from two large customers in North America and $4.1 lower electronic security revenue in Chile due to the business divestiture in September of 2017. These declines were partially offset by additional product volume in Mexico, Ecuador and Canada as well as additional professional services volume in North America and software license volume in Brazil. 



Segment operating profit decreased $10.5 and $37.6 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. Both the three and nine months ended were adversely impacted by lower services gross profit attributable to an unfavorable customer and solution mix in North America as well as higher non-recurring services cost in Brazil banking, primarily in the nine-month period. The decreases were partially offset by a repairable service parts inventory item correcting current and prior year cost of sales resulting in a larger unfavorable impact in 2017. Product gross profit decreased in both the three and nine months ended due primarily to higher freight cost as well as lower volume impacting the nine months ended from supply chain delays in the first half of 2018. Software gross profit was lower in the three months ended due to higher cost while the nine months ended was favorable due to increased professional services activity in North America and software license volume in Brazil. Partially offsetting these declines in both the three and nine months ended, selling and marketing expense decreased from lower AIP cost and associate related cost as well as cost reduction initiatives in Brazil.



Segment operating profit margin decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior-year same periods due to higher cost resulting from non-recurring expense in Brazil and unfavorable services customer and solutions mix in North America and increased product freight expense, partially offset by lower operating expense from cost reduction initiatives in Brazil and lower AIP cost.





In the three months ended September 30, 2018, retail net sales increased $17.3 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $6.7 mainly related to the euro. Prior year net sales were adversely impacted $3.9 related to Deferred Revenue Adjustments. Excluding currency and Deferred Revenue Adjustments, net sales increased $20.1 due to a large North America kiosk project as well as higher POS activity in Spain. These increases were partially offset by lower POS volume in Germany. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, retail net sales increased $37.0 including a favorable net currency impact of $46.8 mostly related to the euro. Prior year net sales were adversely impacted $12.2, including a net favorable currency impact of $1.0, related to Deferred Revenue Adjustments. Excluding currency and Deferred Revenue Adjustments, net sales decreased $23.0 due to large prior year non-recurring POS and kiosk activity in Germany for multiple customers and to a lesser extent, the U.K. Additionally, the Company experienced lower product volume in the non-core business in Eurasia and Brazil. These declines were partially offset by higher product volume in France, Central Eastern Europe and Southern Europe as well as a large retail kiosk project in North America.



Segment operating profit decreased $8.1 and $34.8 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. The decrease in both the three and nine months ended was due primarily to Eurasia from lower product volume combined with an unfavorable customer mix, impacting the gross profit of both the services and software business, as well as an unfavorable product customer mix in the Americas. Additionally, the three and nine months ended were unfavorably impacted by increased operating expense in Eurasia related to research, development, engineering cost and higher selling and administrative expense from developing the North America retail sales organization, as well as lower product volume in Eurasia, unfavorably impacting gross profit from lower product activity in the current year.



Segment operating profit margin decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior-year same periods due to an unfavorable customer and solutions mix. In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2018 included higher operating expense related to the development of the retail business as well as higher research, development and engineering cost in Eurasia which negatively affected operating profit margin.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $9.3 to $194.7 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $185.4 during the same period in 2017 primarily due to incremental increase in depreciation expense offset by lower amortization expense. Share-based compensation increased $4.1 to $27.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to a change in non-substantive vesting terms of certain awards and an increased number of non-vested awards granted. The goodwill impairment was $199.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to $3.1 of other asset impairments during the same period in 2017.



Investing Activities



The maturities and purchases of investments primarily relate to short-term investment activity in Brazil. The $160.9 change was primarily due to the monetization of the Company's investment in the company owned life insurance plans and utilization of short-term investments in Brazil for cash needs across the organization.



Financing Activities



Net cash provided by financing activities was $196.9 and $22.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $174.2. The change was primarily due to an additional $650.0 in proceeds received from the Term Loan A-1 Facility and an increase in net borrowings of the Revolving Facility. The increase in borrowings were partially offset by $306.7 in debt repayments and higher cash distributions primarily related to the redemption of shares and cash compensation to Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders of $337.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $16.3 in the prior-year period. Refer to note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for details of the Company's cash flows related to debt borrowings and repayments.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include revenue recognition, the valuation of trade, finance lease receivables, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, guarantee obligations and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, pension and post-retirement benefits and customer incentives, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors. Management monitors the economic conditions and other factors and will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 



Management believes there have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to the items that the Company disclosed as its critical accounting policies and estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
