OVERVIEW 



Preformed Line Products Company (the “Company”, “PLPC”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) was incorporated in Ohio in 1947. We are an international designer and manufacturer of products and systems employed in the construction and maintenance of overhead and underground networks for the energy, telecommunication, cable operators, information (data communication), and other similar industries. Our primary products support, protect, connect, terminate, and secure cables and wires. We also provide solar hardware systems, mounting hardware for a variety of solar power applications, and fiber optic and copper splice closures. PLPC is respected around the world for quality, dependability and market-leading customer service. Our goal is to continue to achieve profitable growth as a leader in the research, innovation, development, manufacture, and marketing of technically advanced products and services related to energy, communications and cable systems and to take advantage of this leadership position to sell additional quality products in familiar markets. We have 28 sales and manufacturing operations in 20 different countries. 





The segment managers responsible for each region report directly to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, and are accountable for the financial results and performance of their entire segment for which they are responsible. The business components within each segment are managed to maximize the results of the entire operating segment and Company rather than the results of any individual business component of the segment. 



We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on several factors primarily based on sales and net income. 



PREFACE 



Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our discussions of the financial results include non-GAAP measures (e.g., foreign currency impact) to provide additional information concerning our financial results and provide information that we believe is useful to the readers of our consolidated financial statements in the assessment of our performance and operating trends. 









The operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2019 are compared to the same period in 2018. Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019 of $119.2 million increased $10.8 million, or 10%, compared to 2018. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 33.0% in 2019 from 30.9% in 2018. Gross profit for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $39.3 million and $33.5 million, respectively. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, gross profit increased $6.9 million, or 21%, compared to 2018. Costs and expenses of $27.7 million increased $2.2 million compared to 2018 and included a favorable impact from currency translation of $1.1 million. Operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was $11.6 million, an increase of $3.6 million compared to 2018. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 of $8.0 million decreased $1.1 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018. The effect of currency translation had virtually no impact on operating income or net income. 



The operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 are compared to the same period in 2018. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 of $331.2 million increased $15.7 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in 2018. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased to 31.5% in 2019 from 31.8% in 2018. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 of $104.4 million increased $4.2 million, or 4%, compared to 2018. Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency translation, gross profit increased $8.2 million, or 8%, compared to 2018. Costs and expenses of $79.6 million increased $4.5 million compared to 2018 and included a favorable impact from currency translation of $3.7 million. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $24.8 million, a decrease of $.3 million compared to 2018. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 of $17.7 million decreased $3.6 million compared to the same period in 2018. The effect of currency translation had unfavorable impacts on operating income and net income of $.3 million and $.2 million, respectively. 







Despite the constant changes in the current global economy, we believe our business fundamentals and our financial position are sound and that we are strategically well-positioned. We remain focused on assessing our business structure, global facilities and overall capacity in conjunction with the requirements of local manufacturing in the markets that we serve. If necessary, we will modify redundant processes and utilize our global manufacturing network to manage costs, increase sales volumes and deliver value to our customers. We have continued to invest in the business to expand into new markets for the Company, improve efficiency, develop new products, increase our capacity and become an even stronger supplier to our customers. We currently have a bank debt to equity ratio of 24.3% and can borrow needed funds at a competitive interest rate under our credit facility. 





RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 



THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 



The following table sets forth a summary of the Company’s Statements of Consolidated Income and the percentage of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. The Company’s past operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. 









The year-over-year increase in PLP-USA net sales of $1.4 million, or 3%, was primarily due to a volume increase in energy product sales. International net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019 experienced an unfavorable impact of $3.3 million when local currencies were converted to U.S. dollars. The following discussion of net sales excludes the effect of currency translation. The Americas net sales of $19.7 million increased $6.4 million, or 44%, primarily due to a volume increase in energy and communications product sales. EMEA net sales of $21.1 million increased $3.8 million, or 21%, primarily due to a volume increase in energy and communications product sales within the region, including incremental sales from the newly acquired businesses. In Asia-Pacific, net sales of $30.8 million increased $2.4 million, or 8%, compared to 2018 primarily due to a combined volume increase in the energy, communications and special industries products. 









PLP-USA gross profit of $17.7 million increased $1.4 million compared to the same period in 2018 as a result of increased sales volume combined with a product sales mix shift to higher margin product. International gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was unfavorably impacted by $1.1 million when local currencies were translated to U.S. dollars. The following discussion of gross profit excludes the effects of currency translation. The Americas gross profit increase of $2.5 million was primarily the result of a $6.3 million increase in sales combined with a product margin improvement in the region due to sales product mix. EMEA gross profit increased $2.4 million, mainly as a result of increased sales volume. Asia-Pacific gross profit increased $.7 million primarily as a result of a year-over-year increase in sales combined with a sales mix shift to higher margin products. 







PLP-USA costs and expenses of $12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased $1.1 million compared to 2018 mainly due to $.3 million of higher personnel-related expenses, a net increase in foreign currency exchange losses of $.3 million, $.2 million of increased professional fees combined with a net $.2 million of higher year-over-year miscellaneous expenses. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily related to translating into U.S. dollars its foreign denominated loans, trade and royalty receivables from its foreign subsidiaries at the September 30, 2019 exchange rates. On a consolidated basis, costs and expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2019 were favorably impacted by $1.1 million when local currencies were translated to U.S. dollars. The following discussion of costs and expenses excludes the effect of currency translation. The Americas costs and expenses of $3.7 million increased $.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to a $.1 million increase in personnel-related expenses. EMEA costs and expenses of $5.4 million increased $1.9 million mainly due to incremental costs incurred with our acquired businesses. Asia-Pacific costs and expenses of $5.8 million increased $.3 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase in commission expense of $.2 million along with net higher various combined expenses of $.1 million. 



Other income (expense). Other expense for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $.4 million and $.2 million, respectively. 











A $.3 million, or 3%, net increase resulting from higher U.S. permanent items primarily related to uncertain tax positions. 





A $.6 million, or 5%, increase resulting from earnings in jurisdictions with higher tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate. 







A $.9 million, or 12%, net decrease resulting from the final calculation of the Transition Tax.  





A $.7 million, or 9%, net decrease resulting from a net reduction in our deferred taxes due to the result of the U.S. federal statutory rate decrease included in the tax act. 





A $1.2 million, or 15%, net decrease resulting from favorable U.S. permanent items primarily related to discrete items. 







PLP-USA’s net income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 decreased $3.0 million compared to the same period in 2018. While operating income increased $.3 million, it was completely offset by an increase in income taxes of $3.3 million primarily due to a prior year, non-recurring, favorable adjustment resulting from the Tax Act. The following discussion of net income excludes the effect of currency translation. The Americas net income increased $1.6 million as a result of a $2.3 million increase in operating income, partially offset by higher income taxes of $.7 million. EMEA net income increased $.1 million as a result of a $.4 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $.3 million year-over-year increase in income tax expense. Asia-Pacific net income increased $.1 million due to a $.4 million increase in operating income, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $.3 million. 



PLP’s EMEA segment incurred net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $.1 million, which when added back to net income, resulted in an immaterial change to net income attributable to PLP Shareholders. 





NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 



The following table sets forth a summary of the Company’s Statements of Consolidated Income and the percentage of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. The Company’s past operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. 









The year-over-year increase in PLP-USA net sales of $7.1 million, or 6%, was primarily due to a volume increase in energy product sales. International net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 experienced an unfavorable impact of $12.7 million when local currencies were converted to U.S. dollars. The following discussion of net sales excludes the effect of currency translation. The Americas net sales of $51.1 million increased $4.4 million, or 8%, primarily due to a volume increase in energy and communications product sales. EMEA net sales of $59.4 million increased $8.5 million, or 16%, primarily due to a volume increase in energy product sales within the region. In Asia-Pacific, net sales of $85.3 million increased $8.3 million, or 10%, compared to 2018 primarily due to a volume increase in energy and special industries products. 









PLP-USA gross profit of $48.3 million increased $3.3 million compared to the same period in 2018 as a result of higher sales volume combined with a product sales mix shift to higher margin products, primarily energy products. International gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was unfavorably impacted by $4.0 million when local currencies were translated to U.S. dollars. The following discussion of gross profit excludes the effects of currency translation. Despite the increase in sales, the Americas gross profit decreased $1.5 million which was primarily the result of a year-over-year product margin decline in the region due to sales mix and increases in raw material cost. EMEA gross profit increased $3.7 million year-over-year mainly as a result of the $8.5 million increase in sales volume combined with incremental growth from the newly acquired businesses. Asia-Pacific gross profit increased $2.6 million predominantly due to the region’s year-over-year $8.3 million increase in sales and a sales mix shift to higher margin products. 







PLP-USA costs and expenses of $37.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased $2.4 million, or 7%, compared to 2018 mainly due to a $1.1 million increase in professional fees, which includes acquisition-related expenses, $1.0 million of higher personnel-related and benefits expenses combined with a $.4 million increase in bad debt expense, partially offset by $.1 million of net year-over-year gains on foreign currency exchange. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily related to translating into U.S. dollars its foreign denominated loans, trade and royalty receivables from its foreign subsidiaries at the September 30, 2019 exchange rates. On a consolidated basis, costs and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were favorably impacted by $3.7 million when local currencies were translated to U.S. dollars. The following discussion of costs and expenses excludes the effect of currency translation. The Americas costs and expenses of $10.1 million increased $.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to a year-over-year increase in personnel-related expenses. EMEA costs and expenses of $15.0 million increased $4.4 million mainly due to the incremental costs incurred in the newly acquired businesses. Asia-Pacific costs and expenses of $16.9 million increased $1.0 million. This increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs of $.4 million, higher commissions of $.2 million and increased combined legal and bad debt expense of $.4 million. 



Other income (expense). Other expense for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $.8 million and $.4 million, respectively. 











A $.5 million, or 2%, net increase resulting from higher U.S. permanent items and discrete items related to uncertain tax positions. 





A $.8 million, or 3%, increase resulting from earnings in jurisdictions with higher tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate. 







A $.9 million, or 4%, net decrease resulting from the final calculation of the Transition Tax. 





A $.7 million, or 3%, net decrease resulting from a net reduction in our deferred taxes due to the result of the U.S. federal statutory rate decrease included in the Tax Act. 





A $1.0 million, or 4%, net decrease resulting from favorable U.S. permanent items primarily related to discrete items and provisions of the Tax Act. 





A $.8 million, or 4%, increase resulting from earnings in jurisdictions with higher tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate. 







PLP-USA’s net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 decreased $2.3 million compared to the same period in 2018. There was a $1.0 million increase in operating income that was completely offset by an income tax expense increase of $3.3 million which primarily resulted from a non-recurring, favorable prior year adjustment related to the Tax Act. The following discussion of net income excludes the effect of currency translation. The Americas net income decreased $1.5 million as a result of a $2.0 million decrease in operating income and an increase in net interest expense of $.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense of $.7 million. EMEA net income decreased by $.3 million primarily as a result of a decrease in operating income of $.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense of $.3 million. Asia-Pacific net income increased $.7 million as a result of a $1.6 million increase in operating income, partially offset by an increase in net interest expense of $.3 million combined with an increase in income tax expense of $.6 million. 



PLP’s EMEA segment incurred net attributable to noncontrolling interests of less than $.1 million, which when added back to net income, resulted in an immaterial change to net income attributable to PLP Shareholders. 



POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 



Our critical accounting policies are consistent with the information set forth in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed on March 8,  





2019 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are, therefore, not presented herein. For more detail regarding the January 1, 2019 adoption of ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” refer to Note R “Leases” and Note K “Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements.” 



WORKING CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 



Management Assessment of Liquidity 



We measure liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short-term and long-term operating needs, repay debt, fund additional investments, including acquisitions, and make dividend payments to shareholders. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, cash dividends, business acquisitions and access to bank lines of credit. 



Our investments include expenditures required for equipment and facilities as well as expenditures in support of our strategic initiatives. During the first nine months of 2019, we used cash of $22.0 million for capital expenditures. We ended the first nine months of 2019 with $41.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (“Cash”). Our Cash is held in various locations throughout the world. At September 30, 2019, the majority of our Cash was held outside the United States (“U.S.”). We expect most accumulated non-U.S. Cash balances will remain outside of the U.S. and that we will meet U.S. liquidity needs through future cash flows, use of U.S. Cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources. We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing financial statements for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues. We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity from customer credit issues. 



Total debt at September 30, 2019 was $63.0 million. At September 30, 2019, our unused availability under our line of credit was $32.9 million and our bank debt to equity percentage was 24.3%. In 2018, we extended the term on our $65 million credit facility from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2021. All other terms remain the same, including the interest rate at LIBOR plus 1.125% unless our funded debt to Earnings before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation ratio exceeds 2.25 to 1, at which point the LIBOR spread becomes 1.500%. The line of credit agreement contains, among other provisions, requirements for maintaining levels of net worth and funded debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization along with an interest coverage ratio. The net worth and profitability requirements are calculated based on the line of credit agreement. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with these covenants. 





Sources and Uses of Cash 



Cash increased $7.1 million compared to the same period in 2018. Net Cash provided by operating activities was $20.7 million. The most significant net investing and financing uses of Cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were payments of long-term debt of $41.6 million, Cash used to fund the acquisition of SubCon and MICOS Telcom of $18.9 million, capital expenditures of $22.0 million, share repurchases of $4.5 million and dividends paid of $3.2 million, partially offset by net debt and notes payable proceeds of $69.3 million. Currency had a negative $1.8 million impact on Cash when translating foreign denominated financial statements to U.S. dollars. 



Net Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $20.7 million compared to $7.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The $13.6 million increase was primarily a result of a decrease in Cash usage for operating assets (net of operating liabilities) of $16.7 million, which included a reduction resulting from the $5.3 million contribution to the pension plan in 2018, partially offset by a decrease in net income of $3.6 million and an increase in non-cash items of $.5 million. 





Net Cash used in investing activities of $41.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased $29.3 million when compared to Cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $12.0 million. The change was primarily related to Cash used to fund the SubCon and MICOS Telcom acquisitions, net of Cash, of $18.9 million and a year-over-year increase in capital expenditures of $14.7 million, partially offset by a reduction in Cash used year-over year to purchase marketable securities of $4.2 million in 2018. 



Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $20.0 million compared to a cash usage of $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The $24.8 million improvement was primarily the result of a net increase in debt borrowings in 2019 compared to 2018 of $26.4 million, partially offset by a year-over-year change in Cash used for net stock repurchases of $1.5 million.
