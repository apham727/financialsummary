PART II. OTHER INFORMATION



Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



Refer to Note 8, “Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding certain legal proceedings, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.



Item 1A. RISK FACTORS



Current and potential stockholders should consider carefully the risk factors described in more detail in our 2018 Form 10-K. There were no material changes to such risk factors, except to include the risk factors described below. Any of these factors, or others, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and stock price.



The announcement and pendency of our agreement to be acquired by Broadcom may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.







•Disruption to our business, including increased costs and diversion of management time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us;



•The restrictions imposed on our business and operations pursuant to certain covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement, which may prevent us from pursuing certain opportunities, responding to competitive pressures and industry developments, or taking certain actions without Broadcom’s approval;



•Adverse effects on our ability to attract, recruit, retain and motivate current and prospective employees who may be uncertain about their future roles following completion of the proposed transaction, and the possibility that our employees could lose productivity as a result of uncertainty regarding their employment following the proposed transaction;



•The pendency and outcome of the legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against us, our directors, executive officers and others relating to the proposed transaction; and



•The diversion of our employees’ attention due to activities related to the proposed transaction.



The failure to complete our pending acquisition by Broadcom may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price.





•Any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the proposed transaction, including adverse changes in our relationships with customers, suppliers, channel partners, other business partners and employees, may continue or intensify in the event the acquisition is not consummated or is significantly delayed;



•We would have incurred significant costs, including professional services fees and other transaction costs, in connection with the proposed transaction that we would be unable to recover;



•We may have to pay Broadcom a termination fee of $566 million under certain circumstances that give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement;



•We may be subject to negative publicity or be negatively perceived by the investment or business communities;



•We may be subject to legal proceedings related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;



•We may not be able to take advantage of alternative business opportunities or effectively respond to competitive pressures; and



•We may experience a departure of employees.



The Merger Agreement with Broadcom limits our ability to pursue alternative transactions, which could deter a third party from proposing an alternative transaction.



The Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue an alternative acquisition transaction. These or other provisions may discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing an acquisition or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.
