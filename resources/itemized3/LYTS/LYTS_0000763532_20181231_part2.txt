PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 



ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 





Our stock price has experienced a significant decline, which could further adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. 



The market price of our common stock has experienced a significant decline from which it has not fully recovered. During the last twelve months, the sales price of our common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, declined from a high of $8.69 in February 2018 to a low of $3.17 on January 30, 2019. Most recently, on February 1, 2019, the market price of our common stock, as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, closed at a price of $3.20 per share. Our progress in developing and commercializing our products, our quarterly operating results, announcements of new products by us or our competitors, our perceived prospects, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, adverse events related to our strategic relationships, and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, in recent years, including in the first half of fiscal 2019, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These market fluctuations, regardless of the cause, may materially and adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results.
