Item 4. Controls and Procedures.







procedures into the acquired business as part of our integration activities. We are continuing the multi-year, phased



implementation targeted for completion in 2020 of a new core enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system in certain



business units, which we expect to reduce the number of ERP systems across the Company and enhance our system of internal



control over financial reporting. We expect the initial implementation of the new core ERP system in each affected business unit



to involve changes to related processes that are part of our system of internal control over financial reporting and to require



testing for effectiveness and potential further changes as implementation progresses. During fiscal 2018 and 2019, we successfully completed the initial implementation of the new core ERP system in four business units. As part of our integration with L3, we are in the process of incorporating our controls and procedures with respect to L3’s operations, and we will include internal controls with respect to L3’s operations in our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of 2020. Other than the system and related process changes described above as well as changes related to incorporating our controls and procedures with respect to L3’s operations, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 27, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
