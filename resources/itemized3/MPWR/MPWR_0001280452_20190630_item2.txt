Overview 



We are a leading semiconductor company that designs, develops and markets high-performance power solutions. Incorporated in 1997, MPS’s core strengths include deep system-level and applications knowledge, strong analog design expertise and an innovative proprietary process technology. These combined strengths enable MPS to deliver highly integrated monolithic products that offer energy-efficient, cost-effective, easy-to-use solutions for systems found in computing and storage, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer applications. Our mission is to reduce total energy consumption in our customers' systems with green, practical and compact solutions. We believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated, smaller in size, more energy-efficient, more accurate with respect to performance specifications and, consequently, more cost-effective than many competing solutions. We plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories. 



We operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain products. We are not immune from current and future industry downturns, but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term. 



We work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits ("ICs"). This has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs, while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths. 



Following the introduction of a product, our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up. Typical lead time for orders is fewer than 90 days. These factors, combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer, make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult. 



We derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in Asia, where our products are incorporated into end-user products. Our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in Asia was 89% for both the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, and 88% for both the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. We derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our DC to DC converter products which serve the computing and storage, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer markets. We believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new products, enter new market segments, gain market share, manage litigation risk, diversify our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity. 



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 



There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to those disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Revenue 







Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was $151.0 million, an increase of $11.2 million, or 8.0%, from $139.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets except for the consumer market. Overall unit shipments increased by 16% due to higher market demand, and average sales prices decreased by approximately 5% from the same period in 2018. 



For the three months ended June 30, 2019, revenue from the communications market increased $6.4 million, or 41.4%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher demand in networking applications. Revenue from the industrial market increased $3.3 million, or 17.3%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source and security products. Revenue from the computing and storage market increased $4.6 million, or 12.5%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by strength in the high-performance notebook market, which was partially offset by lower demand in the solid-state drive storage market. Revenue from the automotive market increased $0.9 million, or 4.4%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment applications. Revenue from the consumer market decreased $4.0 million, or 8.4%, from the same period in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to softness in demand for high volume consumer-related products, particularly those sold in the greater China region, as well as lower sales from gaming products. This decrease was partially offset by higher demand for mobile phone products.  



Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $292.4 million, an increase of $23.5 million, or 8.7%, from $268.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets except for the consumer market. Overall unit shipments increased by 15% due to higher market demand, and average sales prices decreased by approximately 3% from the same period in 2018. 



For the six months ended June 30, 2019, revenue from the communications market increased $12.9 million, or 41.1%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher demand in networking applications. Revenue from the industrial market increased $7.1 million, or 19.4%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source and security products. Revenue from the computing and storage market increased $12.9 million, or 18.9%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by strength in the high-performance notebook market, which was partially offset by lower demand in the solid-state drive storage market. Revenue from the automotive market increased $3.7 million, or 9.6%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment applications. Revenue from the consumer market decreased $13.0 million, or 13.7%, from the same period in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to softness in demand for high volume consumer-related products, particularly those sold in the greater China region, as well as lower sales from chargers and gaming products. This decrease was partially offset by higher demand for mobile phone products.  



Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin 



 Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs incurred to manufacture, assemble and test our products, as well as warranty costs, inventory-related and other overhead costs, and stock-based compensation expenses. 





Cost of revenue was $67.8 million, or 44.9% of revenue, for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and $62.2 million, or 44.5% of revenue, for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The $5.6 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 16% increase in overall unit shipments and a 2% increase in the average direct cost of units shipped. The increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by a decrease in inventory write-downs.

Gross margin was 55.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared with 55.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of lower margin products, which was partially offset by lower inventory write-downs as a percentage of revenue. 



Cost of revenue was $131.1 million, or 44.9% of revenue, for the six months ended June 30, 2019, and $119.9 million, or 44.6% of revenue, for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The $11.2 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 15% increase in overall unit shipments and a 4% increase in the average direct cost of units shipped. The increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by a decrease in inventory write-downs and warranty expense. 



Gross margin was 55.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared with 55.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of lower margin products, which was partially offset by lower inventory write-downs and warranty expenses as a percentage of revenue.

Litigation Expense 



Litigation expense was $0.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared with $0.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower expenses incurred on an ongoing lawsuit in which we are the plaintiff. 



Litigation expense was $0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared with $1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower expenses incurred on an ongoing lawsuit in which we are the plaintiff. 



Interest and Other Income, Net 



Interest and other income, net, was $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared with $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. For the three months ended June 30, 2019, amortization of premium on available-for-sale investments decreased $0.3 million and income related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments increased $0.2 million, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018. These favorable changes were offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in foreign currency exchange gains. 



Interest and other income, net, was $5.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared with $2.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.3 million in income related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments, a decrease of $0.6 million in amortization of premium on available-for-sale investments, and an increase of $0.3 million in interest income as a result of higher investment balances and yields. These favorable changes were partially offset by an increase of $0.3 million in foreign currency exchange losses. 



Income Tax Expense  



The income tax provision for interim periods is generally determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate and adjusted for discrete items, if any, in the relevant period. Each quarter the estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if our estimated tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made. 



The income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was $1.7 million, or 7.4% of pre-tax income. The income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $0.5 million, or 1.1% of pre-tax income. The effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income from our subsidiaries in Bermuda and China being taxed at lower statutory tax rates, and the benefit obtained from certain discrete items recognized in the period, including excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The decrease in the effective tax rate relative to the federal statutory rate was partially offset by the inclusion of the global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") tax. 



The income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was $2.9 million, or 10.7% of pre-tax income. The income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $3.5 million, or 7.1% of pre-tax income. The effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income from our subsidiaries in Bermuda and China being taxed at lower statutory tax rates, and the benefit obtained from certain discrete items recognized in the period, including excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The decrease in the effective tax rate relative to the federal statutory rate was partially offset by the inclusion of the GILTI tax. 



For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, our effective tax rate included the estimated impact of $10.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, related to the GILTI provisions that was included as additional subpart F income, which was accounted for as a period cost. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, our effective tax rate included the estimated impact of $15.5 million and $27.9 million, respectively, related to the GILTI provisions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 





As of June 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $197.0 million and short-term investments of $169.5 million, compared with cash and cash equivalents of $172.7 million and short-term investments of $204.6 million as of December 31, 2018. As of June 30, 2019, $131.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $81.4 million of short-term investments were held by our international subsidiaries. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, we repatriated $75 million of cash from our Bermuda subsidiary to the U.S. The proceeds were primarily used to fund real estate purchases and cash dividend payments. We may repatriate additional cash from our Bermuda subsidiary to fund our expenditures in future periods. Earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested. 



The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets, reduced by accounts payable, accrued compensation and related benefits, and other accrued liabilities. As of June 30, 2019, we had working capital of $497.0 million, compared with working capital of $500.4 million as of December 31, 2018. The $3.4 million decrease in working capital was due to a $7.7 million increase in current liabilities, which was partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in current assets. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued compensation and related benefits. The increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents, inventories and other current assets, which was partially offset by a decrease in short-term investments.  



Summary of Cash Flows 







For the six months ended June 30, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $82.9 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $7.3 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth. The decrease in income tax liabilities was primarily due to income tax payments made, including the deemed repatriation transition tax, for the year. For the six month ended June 30, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $41.7 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $41.7 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by increased sales and the timing of shipments in the last month of the quarter. The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth. The increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet future demand. 



For the six months ended June 30, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $42.1 million, primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of $77.6 million, which included the purchase of a building and land in Kirkland, Washington for $52.3 million and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of $1.4 million, which was partially offset by net proceeds from maturities and sales of investments of $36.5 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $29.9 million, primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of $13.0 million, net purchases of short-term investments of $15.9 million, and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of $0.9 million.

For the six months ended June 30, 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $16.7 million, primarily reflecting $30.8 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, which was partially offset by $14.1 million of cash proceeds from vesting of RSUs and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $11.1 million, primarily reflecting $21.5 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, partially offset by $10.3 million of cash proceeds from vesting of RSUs and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.  



We anticipate that cash used for future dividends and dividend equivalent payments, as well as payments for the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax and other expenditures, will come from our current domestic cash, cash generated from ongoing U.S. operations, and cash repatriated from our Bermuda subsidiary. Earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested. 



Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short-term investments, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.  







Contractual Obligations 



Our outstanding purchase commitments primarily consist of wafer purchases, assembly and other manufacturing services, construction services and license arrangements. As of June 30, 2019, the outstanding balance under our purchase commitments was $71.4 million, compared with $61.4 million as of December 31, 2018. 



Under the 2017 Tax Act, we have a transition tax liability which represents a one-time, mandatory deemed repatriation tax imposed on previously deferred foreign earnings. As permitted by the 2017 Tax Act, we elected to pay the tax liability in installments on an interest-free basis through 2025. As of June 30, 2019, the outstanding liability was $20.7 million, compared with $22.1 million as of December 31, 2018. 



Our long-term obligations include long-term liabilities reflected on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which primarily consist of the deferred compensation plan liabilities and accrued dividend equivalents. As of June 30, 2019, the outstanding obligations were $43.4 million, compared with $38.5 million as of December 31, 2018. 



Our other contractual obligations have not changed significantly from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 



As of June 30, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation S-K.
