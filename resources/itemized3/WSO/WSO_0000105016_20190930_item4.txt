 ITEM 4.  



CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 



We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 



13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“the Exchange Act”)) that are, among other things, designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Executive Vice President (“EVP”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure and appropriate SEC filings.



Our management, with the participation of our CEO, EVP and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and, based on that evaluation, our CEO, EVP and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at a reasonable assurance level, at and as of such date. 



Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 



We are continuously seeking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations and of our internal controls. This results in refinements to processes throughout the Company. However, there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 





15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2019, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, we have not yet assessed the internal control over financial reporting of PPI or DASCO, which collectively represented approximately 6% of our total consolidated assets at September 30, 2019 and approximately 2% of our consolidated revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. From the respective acquisition dates of August 1, 2019 and April 2, 2019 to September 30, 2019, the processes and systems of PPI and DASCO did not impact the internal controls over financial reporting for our other consolidated subsidiaries.
