NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  





1. Basis of Presentation  



The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the information set forth therein have been included. The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Jabil Inc. (the Company) for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017. Results for the three months ended November 30, 2017 are not necessarily an indication of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year ending August 31, 2018.  



2. Earnings Per Share and Dividends  



Earnings Per Share  



The Company calculates its basic earnings per share by dividing net income attributable to Jabil Inc. by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Companys diluted earnings per share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the effect of dilutive securities. The difference between the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding and the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to dilutive unvested restricted stock awards and dilutive stock appreciation rights.  







Dividends  









Table of Contents 











The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense within selling, general and administrative expense as follows  







 (1) Represents a one-time cash-settled stock award that vested on November 30, 2017.  



As of November 30, 2017, the shares available to be issued under the 2011 Stock Award and Incentive Plan were 12,327,622.  



Restricted Stock Awards  





On October 6, 2017, the Companys Compensation Committee approved the modification of vesting criteria for certain performance-based restricted stock awards granted in fiscal year 2015. As a result of the modification, 0.8 million awards vested during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, which resulted in approximately $24.9 million of stock-based compensation expense recognized for the three months ended November 30, 2017.

Share Repurchases  



In July 2017, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $450.0 million of the Companys common stock (the 2017 Share Repurchase Program). The 2017 Share Repurchase Program expires on August 31, 2018. As of November 30, 2017, 3.2 million shares had been repurchased for $93.2 million and $356.7 million remains available under the 2017 Share Repurchase Program.  



5. Concentration of Risk and Segment Data  



Concentration of Risk  



Sales of the Companys products are concentrated among specific customers. During the three months ended November 30, 2017, the Companys five largest customers accounted for approximately 51% of its net revenue and 74 customers accounted for approximately 90% of its net revenue. Sales to these customers were reported in the Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) and Diversified Manufacturing Services (DMS) operating segments.  



The Company procures components from a broad group of suppliers. Almost all of the products manufactured by the Company require one or more components that are available from only a single source.  



Segment Data  



Net revenue for the operating segments is attributed to the segment in which the service is performed. An operating segments performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income. Segment income is defined as net revenue less cost of revenue, segment selling, general and administrative expenses, segment research and development expenses and an allocation of corporate manufacturing expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment income does not include amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition costs and certain purchase accounting adjustments, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, business interruption and impairment charges, net, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, other expense, interest income, interest expense, income tax expense or adjustment for net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Total segment assets are defined as accounts receivable, inventories, net customer-related property, plant and equipment, intangible assets net of accumulated amortization and goodwill. All other non-segment assets are reviewed on a global basis by management. Transactions between operating segments are generally recorded at amounts that approximate those at which we would transact with third parties.  





Table of Contents 







As of November 30, 2017, the Company operated in 29 countries worldwide. Sales to unaffiliated customers are based on the Companys location that maintains the customer relationship and transacts the external sale. Total foreign net revenue represented 92.3% of net revenue during both the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016.  



6. Notes Payable, Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations  







 (1)  The notes are carried at the principal amount of each note, less any unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs.  





Table of Contents 



 (2)  The Senior Notes are the Companys senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations.  







Additionally, the Companys foreign subsidiaries had various additional credit facilities that finance their future growth and any corresponding working capital needs.  



As of November 30, 2017, the Company has $2.2 billion in available unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities.  



Debt Covenants  





Fair Value  



The estimated fair values of the Companys publicly traded debt, including the 8.250%, 5.625% and 4.700% senior notes, were approximately $405.6 million, $431.2 million and $525.3 million, respectively, as of November 30, 2017. The fair value estimates are based upon observable market data (Level 2 criteria). The estimated fair value of the Companys private debt, the 4.900% senior notes, was approximately $311.7 million, as of November 30, 2017. This fair value estimate is based on the Companys indicative borrowing cost derived from discounted cash flows (Level 3 criteria). The carrying amounts of borrowings under credit facilities and under loans approximate fair value as interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates.  



7. Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization and Sale Programs  



The Company regularly sells designated pools of trade accounts receivable under two asset-backed securitization programs and five uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs (collectively referred to herein as the programs). The Company continues servicing the receivables sold and in exchange receives a servicing fee under each of the programs. Servicing fees related to each of the programs recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016 were not material. The Company does not record a servicing asset or liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company estimates that the fee it receives to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities.  



Transfers of the receivables under the programs are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, net receivables sold under the programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  



Asset-Backed Securitization Programs  







Table of Contents 



The special purpose entity in the North American asset-backed securitization program is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The special purpose entity in the foreign asset-backed securitization program is a separate bankruptcy-remote entity whose assets would be first available to satisfy the creditor claims of the unaffiliated financial institution. The Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of this special purpose entity as the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive the benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity from the transfer of the trade accounts receivable into the special purpose entity. Accordingly, the special purpose entities associated with these asset-backed securitization programs are included in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  







 (1) Maximum amount available at any one time.  



 (2) On November 9, 2017, the program was extended to October 20, 2020.  







 (1) For the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, the amount represented proceeds from collections reinvested in revolving-period transfers as there were no new transfers during the period.  



 (2) Recorded to other expense within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  



 (3) Recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are valued using unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs), primarily discounted cash flows, and due to their credit quality and short-term maturity the fair values approximated book values. The unobservable inputs consist of estimated credit losses and estimated discount rates, which both have an immaterial impact on the fair value calculations.  



The asset-backed securitization programs require compliance with several covenants. The North American asset-based securitization program covenants include compliance with the interest ratio and debt to EBITDA ratio of the Credit Facility. The foreign asset-backed securitization program covenants include limitations on certain corporate actions such as mergers and consolidations. As of November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the asset-backed securitization programs.

Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs  







 (1) Maximum amount available at any one time.  



 (2) The maximum amount under the program will be reduced to $650.0 million on February 1, 2018.  



 (3) Any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice.  







 (1) The resulting losses on the sales of trade accounts receivable during the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016 were not material and were recorded to other expense within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  



8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income  







 (1) There is no tax benefit (expense) related to the foreign currency translation adjustment components of AOCI, including reclassification adjustments, for the three months ended November 30, 2017.  



 (2) $3.5 million of AOCI reclassified into earnings during the three months ended November 30, 2017 for derivative instruments was classified as a reduction of income tax expense. The remaining amount reclassified into earnings was primarily classified as a component of cost of revenue. $11.3 million expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months will be classified as a reduction of income tax expense. The remaining amount expected to be reclassified into earnings will be classified as a component of cost of revenue. The annual tax benefit (expense) for unrealized gains on derivative instruments is not material for the three months ended November 30, 2017.  



 (3) There is no tax benefit (expense) related to the available for sale securities components of AOCI, including reclassification adjustments, for the three months ended November 30, 2017.

9. Commitments and Contingencies  



The Company is party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  



The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its field examination of the Companys tax returns for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and issued a Revenue Agents Report (RAR) on May 27, 2015, which was updated on June 22, 2016. The IRS completed its field examination of the Companys tax returns for fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and issued an RAR on April 19, 2017. The proposed adjustments in the RAR from both examination periods relate primarily to U.S. taxation of certain intercompany transactions. If the IRS ultimately prevails in its positions, the Companys income tax payment due for the fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and 2012 through 2014 would be approximately $28.6 million and $5.3 million, respectively, after utilization of tax loss carry forwards available through fiscal year 2014. Also, the IRS has proposed interest and penalties with respect to fiscal years 2009 through 2011. The IRS may make similar claims in future audits with respect to these types of transactions. At this time, anticipating the amount of any future IRS proposed adjustments, interest and penalties is not practicable.  



The Company disagrees with the proposed adjustments and intends to vigorously contest these matters through the applicable IRS administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. As the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain, the Company continues to provide for the uncertain tax positions based on the more likely than not standard. While the resolution of the issues may result in tax liabilities, interest and penalties, which may be significantly higher than the amounts accrued for these matters, management currently believes that the resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance that managements beliefs will be realized.  



10. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities  



The Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Companys financial performance and are referred to as market risks. The Company, where deemed appropriate, uses derivatives as risk management tools to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.  



Foreign Currency Risk Management  



Forward contracts are put in place to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses. A hedging relationship existed with an aggregate notional amount outstanding of $480.7 million and $314.6 million as of November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, respectively. The related forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The forward foreign exchange contract transactions will effectively lock in the value of anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses against foreign currency fluctuations. The anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses being hedged are expected to occur between December 1, 2017 and August 31, 2018.  



In addition to derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments and qualify for hedge accounting, the Company also enters into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, fixed purchase obligations and intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity. The aggregate notional amount of these outstanding contracts as of November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, was $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.  







The Companys forward foreign exchange contracts are measured on a recurring basis at fair value, based on foreign currency spot rates and forward rates quoted by banks or foreign currency dealers.  





Table of Contents 







The gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness and the amount excluded from effectiveness testing were not material for all periods presented and are included as components of net revenue, cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expense.  



The Company recognized gains and losses in earnings related to changes in fair value of derivatives utilized for foreign currency risk management purposes and not designated as hedging instruments during the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016. These amounts were not material and were recognized as components of cost of revenue.  



Interest Rate Risk Management  



The Company periodically enters into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with the Companys borrowings.  



Cash Flow Hedges  



During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company entered into forward starting swap transactions to hedge the fixed interest rate payments for an anticipated debt issuance. The forward starting swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $200.0 million and have been designated as hedging instruments and accounted for as cash flow hedges. The forward starting swaps are scheduled to expire on March 15, 2018. If the anticipated debt issuance occurs before March 15, 2018, the contracts will be terminated simultaneously with the debt issuance. The contracts will be settled with the respective counterparties on a net basis at the time of termination or expiration. Changes in the fair value of the forward starting swap transactions are recorded on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of AOCI.  



During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company entered into interest rate swap transactions to hedge the variable interest rate payments for the Term Loan Facility. In connection with this transaction, the Company will pay interest based upon a fixed rate as agreed upon with the respective counterparties and receive variable rate interest payments based on the one-month LIBOR. The interest rate swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $200.0 million and have been designated as hedging instruments and accounted for as cash flow hedges. The interest rate swaps were effective on September 30, 2016 and are scheduled to expire on June 30, 2019. The contracts will be settled with the respective counterparties on a net basis at each settlement date. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap transactions are recorded on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of AOCI.

11. Restructuring and Related Charges  







 (1) Includes $5.9 million and $7.4 million recorded in the EMS segment, $4.6 million and $11.5 million recorded in the DMS segment and $0.9 million and $17.0 million of non-allocated charges for the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Except for asset write-off costs, all restructuring and related charges are cash costs.  



 (2)  Primarily relates to the 2017 Restructuring Plan.  





On September 15, 2016, the Companys Board of Directors formally approved a restructuring plan to better align the Companys global capacity and administrative support infrastructure to further optimize organizational effectiveness. This action includes headcount reductions across the Companys selling, general and administrative cost base and capacity realignment in higher cost locations (the 2017 Restructuring Plan).  



Upon completion of the 2017 Restructuring Plan, the Company expects to recognize approximately $195.0 million in restructuring and other related costs. The Company has incurred $164.6 million in costs-to-date as of November 30, 2017. The remaining costs for employee severance and benefit costs, asset write-off costs and other related costs are anticipated to be incurred during the remainder of fiscal year 2018.  



The tables below summarize the Companys liability activity, primarily associated with the 2017 Restructuring Plan  









On September 1, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of True-Tech Corporation (True-Tech) for approximately $95.9 million in cash, which remains subject to adjustment based on review of the actual net assets of the acquisition as of the closing date. True-Tech is a manufacturer specializing in aerospace, semiconductor and medical machined components.  



The acquisition of True-Tech assets has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired of $114.4 million, including $25.9 million in intangible assets and $22.3 million in goodwill, and liabilities assumed of $18.5 million were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.  





Table of Contents 



The Company is currently evaluating the fair values of the assets related to this business combination. The preliminary estimates and measurements are, therefore, subject to change during the measurement period for inventory, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill and tax adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities was recorded to goodwill and was fully allocated to the EMS segment. The majority of the goodwill is currently expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The results of operations were included in the Companys condensed consolidated financial results beginning on September 1, 2017. Pro forma information has not been provided as the acquisition of True-Tech is not deemed to be significant.

13. New Accounting Guidance  



Recently Issued Accounting Guidance  



During fiscal year 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard which will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP. The new standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The accounting standard is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this standard.  



The Company has determined that the new standard will result in a change to the timing of the Companys revenue recognition policy for certain customer contracts to an over time model as opposed to a point in time model upon delivery. Additionally, the Company anticipates the new standard will impact the Companys accounting for certain fulfillment costs, which include up-front costs to prepare for manufacturing activities that are expected to be recovered. Under the new standard, such up-front costs would be recognized as an asset and amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of the goods to which the asset relates. The financial impacts of the new standard cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The Company is in the process of implementing changes to its processes, policies and internal controls to meet the impact of the new standard and disclosure requirements. The Company expects to adopt the new guidance under the modified retrospective approach.  



During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. Early application is permitted only for certain provisions, and the update must be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the standard. The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.  



During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard revising lease accounting. The new guidance requires organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and disclose key information regarding leasing arrangements. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Early application of the new standard is permitted and the standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard will impact the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company is currently assessing any other impacts this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.  



During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard, which replaces the existing incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. This guidance must be applied using a modified retrospective or prospective transition method, depending on the area covered by this accounting standard. The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.  



During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to address the presentation of certain transactions within the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.  



During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The new standard eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory and requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences when the transfer occurs. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and early adoption is permitted. This guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.  



During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that clarifies the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and will be applied on a prospective basis. Early application is permitted for certain transactions. The impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements will depend on the facts and circumstances of any specific future transactions.  



During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Goodwill will be considered impaired when the carrying amount of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early application permitted. The guidance will be applied on a prospective basis. The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.  





Table of Contents 



During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which clarifies the scope of accounting for asset derecognition and adds further guidance for recognizing gains and losses from the transfer of non-financial assets in contracts with non-customers. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 coincident with the new revenue recognition guidance. The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 



During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entitys risk management activities by simplifying the application of hedge accounting and improving the related disclosures in its financial statements. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. The guidance must be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.  



Recently issued accounting guidance not discussed above is not applicable or did not have, or is not expected to have, a material impact to the Company.  









The Company has evaluated subsequent events that occurred through the date of the filing of the Companys first quarter of fiscal year 2018 Form 10-Q. No significant events occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date and prior to the filing date of this report that would have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
