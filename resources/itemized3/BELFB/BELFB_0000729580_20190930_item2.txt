 Overview 



Our Company 



We design, manufacture and market a broad array of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits. These products are primarily used in the networking, telecommunications, computing, military, aerospace, transportation and broadcasting industries. Bel’s portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive, medical and consumer electronics markets. 





Our operating expenses are driven principally by the cost of labor where the factories that Bel uses are located, the cost of the materials that we use and our ability to effectively and efficiently manage overhead costs. As labor and material costs vary by product line and region, any significant shift in product mix can have an associated impact on our costs of sales. Costs are recorded as incurred for all products manufactured. Such amounts are determined based upon the estimated stage of production and include labor cost and fringes and related allocations of factory overhead. Our products are manufactured at various facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Dominican Republic, England, Czech Republic, Slovakia and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). 



We have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and we can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products. Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition and be able to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time. These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, and overtime required in order to meet any increase in demand, can add volatility to the labor costs incurred by us. 



Key Factors Affecting our Business 









    •   Product Mix – Material and labor costs vary by product line and any significant shift in product mix between higher- and lower-margin product lines will have a corresponding impact on the Company’s gross margin percentage. In general, our connectivity products have the highest contribution margins, our magnetic products are more labor intensive and are therefore less profitable than the connectivity products and our power products are on the lower end of our profit margin range, due to their high material content. Fluctuations in sales volume among our product groups will have a corresponding impact on Bel’s profit margins.

    •   Effective Tax Rate – The Company’s effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic segment in which our pretax profits are earned. Of the geographic segments in which we operate, the U.S. and Europe’s tax rates are generally equivalent; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company’s three geographical segments. See Note 10, “Income Taxes”.    



After record bookings throughout 2018, the Company has experienced slower bookings during the first nine months of 2019 as customers work through their inventory on hand. The Company has also experienced margin pressure throughout 2019 due to lower sales volumes and high material costs from 2018 which continue to run through the Company’s statement of operations. As a result of these ongoing factors, the Company expects the balance of 2019 to remain challenging from both a sales and margin perspective. The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement. See “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information.” 



Summary by Operating Segment 









Table of Contents  



Sales declines in each of our segments during the third quarter of 2019 reflected lower sales into our distribution channel as our distribution partners continue to work down their level of inventory on hand. Sales of our connector products into military applications were also lower during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018, impacting our North America segment sales. Sales in our Asia segment in the third quarter of 2019 were down versus 2018 as a result of customers working down heightened inventory levels which had been built up during 2018 in response to new product launches and the tariffs that went into effect in 2018 and 2019. 



Net sales and (loss) income from operations by operating segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows. Segment net sales are attributed to individual segments based on the geographic source of the billing for customer sales. 







Net Sales 









Sales of our Connectivity Solutions products during the third quarter of 2019 declined $4.0 million primarily due to lower demand from military customers as compared to last year's third quarter, and reduced volume of product flowing through our distribution channels as our distribution partners continue to work down inventory levels that had been built up in 2018 ahead of the tariffs. These factors also impacted the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019, which declined $8.9 million from the same period of 2018, partially offset by higher sales to commercial aerospace customers during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Sales of our Magnetic Solutions products during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were down $13.3 million and $18.0 million, respectively, from the same periods of 2018 while inventory levels built up in advance of a customer's new program launch during 2018 are worked through. 





Sales of our Power Solutions and Protection products were $4.7 million lower in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter of 2018. Sales of our Bel Power Solutions products into datacenter applications decreased by $3.8 million and sales of our Circuit Protection products were $0.9 million lower as compared to last year’s third quarter. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in sales of our Custom Module products. Sales during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $1.2 million from the same period of 2018, as stronger sales into datacenter applications during the first quarter of 2019 lessened the impact of sales declines during the second and third quarters of 2019. 



Cost of Sales 







Material costs as a percentage of sales were higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods of 2018 primarily due to the industry-wide supply constraints related to certain of our purchased components during 2018. The finished goods shipped during the third quarter of 2019 still contained some of the higher-cost raw material components. 



Labor costs as a percentage of sales declined during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods of 2018 as a more favorable exchange rate environment related to the Chinese Renminbi offset the overall impact of minimum wage increases in the PRC and Mexico. The PRC government increased the minimum wage in the regions where Bel’s factories are located in February and July of 2018. The minimum wage rates in Mexico increased effective January 1, 2019. 





The other expenses noted in the table above include fixed cost items such as support labor and fringe, depreciation and amortization, and facility costs (rent, utilities, insurance). In total, these other expenses decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 by $2.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2018, primarily due to lower support labor and fringe expense and a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense in the 2019 periods.

Provision for Income Taxes 



The Company’s effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic segment in which the pretax profits are earned. Of the geographic segments in which the Company operates, the U.S. and Europe’s tax rates are generally equivalent; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company’s three geographical segments. See Note 10, “Income Taxes”. 



The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $0.6 million and ($2.2) million, respectively. The Company’s earnings before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2019, were approximately $15.1 million lower than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to the $8.9 million impairment of goodwill in North America, as well as lower earnings in the North America and Asia segments. The Company’s effective tax rate was (10.0%) and (24.1%) for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, is primarily attributable to a decrease in U.S. taxes relating to income from foreign subsidiaries taxed in the U.S. as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, the change in the tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is attributable to a decrease in tax expense in the North America segment due to the reduction in the estimated transition tax on post-1986 untaxed accumulated foreign earnings as well as a decrease in the taxes related to uncertain tax positions during the 2018 period. See Note 10, “Income Taxes.” 



The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The Company’s earnings before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were approximately $18.5 million lower than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to the $8.9 million impairment of goodwill in North America, as well as lower earnings in the North America and Asia segments. The Company’s effective tax rate was (78.2%) and 3.0% for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018, is primarily attributable to the same factors noted above related to the third quarter, as well as the impact from permanent tax differences on U.S. tax-exempt activities during the first quarter of 2019. 



Liquidity and Capital Resources 



Our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit, including our credit facility. Our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses, investments in working capital, capital expenditures, interest, taxes, dividends, debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. We believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations, including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months. 



At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $25.2 million and $46.3 million, respectively (or 39% and 86%, respectively), of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries of the Company. During the first nine months of 2019, the Company repatriated $29.3 million of funds from outside of the U.S., with minimal incremental tax liability. We continue to analyze our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to further repatriation, and we have yet to make any further determination regarding repatriation of funds from outside the U.S. to fund the Company’s U.S. operations in the future. In the event these funds were needed for Bel’s U.S. operations, the Company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. state taxes and any applicable foreign withholding taxes to repatriate these funds. 



Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable comprised approximately 33.1% of the Company’s total assets at September 30, 2019 and 32.9% of total assets at December 31, 2018. The Company’s current ratio (i.e., the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 3.2 to 1 at September 30, 2019 and 2.7 to 1 at December 31, 2018. 



In June 2014, the Company entered into a senior Credit and Security Agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2016, and further amended and refinanced in December 2017. The Credit and Security Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined (“Leverage Ratio”), and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA to the Company’s consolidated fixed charges (“Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio”). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit and Security Agreement would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. The unused credit available under the credit facility at September 30, 2019 was $75.0 million, of which we had the ability to borrow $40.6 million without violating our Leverage Ratio covenant based on the Company’s existing consolidated EBITDA.

Cash Flows 



Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 





   •  net cash provided by operating activities of $18.9 million; partially offset by    



   •  purchases of property, plant and equipment of $8.2 million;    



   •  dividend payments of $2.4 million; and    



   •  repayments of long-term debt of $2.2 million    



During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, accounts receivable decreased by $12.4 million primarily due to lower sales during the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased slightly to 58 days at September 30, 2019 from 59 days at December 31, 2018. Inventory decreased by $8.4 million at September 30, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. Inventory turns were 3.7 at each of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 



Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 





   •  purchases of property, plant and equipment of $8.8 million;    



   •  repayments of long-term debt of $8.3 million; and    



   •  dividend payments of $2.4 million; partially offset by    



   •  net cash provided by operations of $4.2 million.    



During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, accounts receivable increased by $19.0 million primarily due to higher sales volume in the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 61 days at September 30, 2018 from 60 days at December 31, 2017. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company implemented a change in the timing of revenue recognition (and related release of inventory from our books) in connection with the adoption of ASC 606. Excluding the adoption adjustment related to this accounting change, inventory increased by $20.1 million at September 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily in raw materials. The increased raw materials balance was driven by a higher volume of raw materials purchased to accommodate increased demand for our products, coupled with higher material costs in 2018 resulting from constraints in component availability. Inventory turns increased from 3.6 at December 31, 2017 to 4.0 at September 30, 2018, primarily due to the change in revenue recognition accounting noted above. 



Critical Accounting Policies 



Management’s discussion and analysis of Bel’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, warranties, SERP expense, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
