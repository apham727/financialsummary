Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Description of Business 

In this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, Mesa Laboratories, Inc., a Colorado corporation, together with its subsidiaries is collectively referred to as “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “Mesa.” 

We pursue a strategy of focusing primarily on quality control products and services which are sold into niche markets that are driven by regulatory requirements. We prefer markets in which we can establish a strong presence and achieve high gross margins. We are organized into four divisions, or segments, across ten physical locations. Our Sterilization and Disinfection Control Division manufactures and sells biological, cleaning, and chemical indicators. Biological, cleaning, and chemical indicators are used to assess the effectiveness of sterilization and disinfection processes in the hospital, dental, medical device, and pharmaceutical industries. The division also provides testing and laboratory services, mainly to the dental industry. Our Instruments Division designs, manufactures, and markets quality control instruments and disposable products utilized in the healthcare, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, medical device, industrial hygiene, and environmental air sampling industries. Our Cold Chain Monitoring Division designs, develops, and markets systems which are used to monitor various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and differential pressure to ensure that critical storage and processing conditions are maintained in hospitals, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, blood banks, pharmacies, and laboratory environments. Our Cold Chain Packaging Division, which we plan to exit no later than March 31, 2020, provides thermal packaging products such as coolers, boxes, insulation materials, and phase-change products to control temperature during the customer’s transport of their own products. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management, such unaudited information includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for the entire year. The financial statements and related notes do not include all information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual reports. This quarterly report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2019. 

Fair Value Measurements 

Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, obligations under trade accounts payable and short and long-term debt. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying values for cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable approximate fair value. The fair value of our short term and long-term debt reflects the market rates at each period end for debt with financial ratios similar to our ratings and is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Our debt has a variable interest rate, so the carrying amount approximates fair value because interest rates on these instruments approximate the interest rate on debt with similar terms available to us. Assets recognized or disclosed at fair value on the consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property and equipment, operating lease assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. Except as stated below in "Acquisitions," we had no non-financial assets or liabilities that were measured using Level 3 inputs. There were no transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during the three months ended March 31, 2019 or March 31, 2018, respectively.  

Acquisitions 

During the three months ended June 30, 2019, we completed a business combination (the “IBP Acquisition”) whereby we acquired the common stock of IBP Medical GmbH, a company whose business manufactures medical meters used to test various parameters of dialysis fluid (dialysate), and the proper calibration and operation of a dialysis machine. During the three months ended June 30, 2019, we allocated the purchase price according to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed using information obtained during due diligence and through the use of financial and other information available to us. Fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired was determined using Level 3 inputs (unobservable inputs) based on a discounted cash flow method.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments -Credit Losses (Topic 316): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, as modified by ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, which amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on expected losses rather than incurred losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. This may result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We have not yet completed our assessment of the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements; however, we believe that the most notable impact of this ASU will relate to our processes around the assessment of the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on trade accounts receivable and the recognition of credit losses.  

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The pronouncement requires lessees to recognize a liability for lease obligations, which represents the discounted obligation to make future minimum lease payments, and a corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet for all leases with terms greater than 12 months. The guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to present financial statement users with the ability to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.  

On April 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02 using the modified retrospective method for all lease arrangements at the beginning of the period of adoption. Results for reporting periods beginning April 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under topic 840, Leases.  The standard had a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, but did not have a significant impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income or our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The most significant impact was the recognition of the right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  


    ●   To carry forward the historical lease determination and classification conclusions as established under the old standard, and not reassess initial direct costs for existing leases;    

    ●   Not to apply the balance sheet recognition requirements of the new lease standard to leases with a term of one year or less (short-term leases); and    

    ●   For all classes of underlying assets, to account for non-lease components of a contract separately from the lease component to which they are related.    

As a result of the cumulative impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, we recorded operating lease ROU assets of $1,461 and operating lease liabilities of $1,411 as of April 1, 2019. Our calculations were based on the present value of the future lease payments on the date of adoption. Refer to Note 4. Leases for additional disclosures required by ASC 842.  

Note 2. Revenue Recognition 

We design, manufacture, market, sell, and maintain quality control instruments and software, consumables, and services driven primarily by the regulatory requirements of niche markets. Our consumables, such as biological indicator test strips and packaging materials, are typically used on a standalone basis; however, some, such as calibration solutions, are also critical to the ongoing use of our instruments. Hardware and software sales, such as medical meters, wireless sensor systems, and data loggers are generally driven by our acquisition of new customers, growth of existing customers, or customer replacement of existing equipment. Hardware sales may be offered with perpetual or annual software licenses, which in some cases are required for the hardware to function. We evaluate our revenues internally by product line, timing of revenue generation, and the nature of goods and services provided. Typically, discrete revenue is recognized at the shipping point or upon completion of the service, while contracted revenue is recognized over a period of time reflective of the performance obligation period in the applicable contract. 


Table of Contents  


Our performance obligations related to the sale of instruments and consumables generally consist of the promise to sell tangible goods to distributors or end users. Ownership of these goods is typically transferred at time of shipment, at which point we have satisfied our performance obligation and we recognize revenue. 






Table of Contents  

Contract Balances 

Our contracts have varying payment terms and conditions. Some customers prepay for services, resulting in unearned revenues or customer deposits, called contract liabilities, which are included within other accrued expenses and unearned revenues in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract assets would exist when sales are recorded (i.e. the control of the goods or services has been transferred to the customer), but customer payment is contingent on a future event besides the passage of time (such as satisfaction of additional performance obligations). We do not have any contract assets. Unbilled receivables, which are not classified as contract assets, represent arrangements in which sales have been recorded prior to billing and right to payment is unconditional. 







Table of Contents  


Under the new lease standard, a contract is a lease or contains one when (1) the contract contains an explicitly or implicitly identified asset and (2) the customer obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and directs how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract in exchange for consideration. We assess whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, upon inception of the contract. As of June 30, 2019, we have operating leases for buildings, warehouses, and office equipment. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date. Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments. Adjustments would also be made for accrued lease payments, initial direct costs, lease incentives, and impairment of operating lease assets, none of which are present in any of our current lease contracts. To determine the present value of lease payments not yet paid, we estimate incremental secured borrowing rates corresponding to the maturities of the leases. When readily determinable, the discount rate used to calculate the lease liability is the rate implicit in the lease. Otherwise we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement. Our short-term leases are not material. 

Our leases typically contain rent escalations over the lease term. We recognize expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of our leases include one or more renewal or termination options at our discretion, which are included in the determination of the lease term if we are reasonably certain to exercise the option. We have also entered into lease agreements that have variable payments related to certain indexes. Variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which those payments are incurred. 











As of June 30, 2019, we had no additional significant operating leases that had not yet commenced.  




Table of Contents  

Note 5. Long-Term Debt 



On March 1, 2017, we entered into a five-year agreement (the “Credit Facility”) for an $80,000 revolving line of credit (“Line of Credit”), a $20,000 term loan (“Term Loan”) and up to $2,500 of letters of credit with a banking syndicate of four banks. In addition, the Credit Facility provides a post-closing accordion feature which allows for the Company to request to increase the Line of Credit or Term Loan up to an additional $100,000. 


The Credit Facility is secured by all of our assets and requires us to maintain a ratio of funded debt to our trailing four quarters of EBIDTA (the “Leverage Ratio”), as defined in the agreement, of less than 3.0 to 1.0, provided that, we may once during the term of the Credit Facility, in connection with a Permitted Acquisition for which the aggregate consideration paid or to be paid in respect thereof equals or exceeds $20,000, elect to increase the maximum Leverage Ratio permitted hereunder to (i) 3.50 to 1.00 for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such Permitted Acquisition occurs (the “Initial Holiday Period”) and (ii) 3.25 to 1.00 for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters immediately following the Initial Holiday Period. The Credit Facility also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of less than 1.25 to 1.0. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of June 30, 2019. 



Note 6. Stock-Based Compensation  



Stock-based compensation expense is included in cost of revenues, selling, general and administrative, and research and development expense in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 


Table of Contents  



Eight of the RSUs granted during the quarter ended June 30, 2019 were subject to performance and service conditions and are considered performance share units ("PSUs"). During the three months ended June 30, 2019, we awarded PSUs that are subject to both service and performance conditions to eligible employees. The PSUs had a grant date fair value of $202.00 per share and vest based on our achievement of specific performance criteria for the three-year period from April 1, 2019 through March 31, 2022 and on continued service through June 15, 2022. The quantity of shares that will be issued upon vesting will range from 0% to 200% of the targeted number of shares; if the defined minimum targets are not met, then no shares will vest.   

Note 7. Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share (“diluted EPS”) is computed similarly to basic earnings per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised. Potentially dilutive securities include common shares related to stock options and RSUs (collectively “stock awards”). Stock awards are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS in the event that they are subject to performance conditions or are antidilutive. 





Note 8. Income Taxes 

For interim income tax reporting, we estimate our annual effective tax rate and apply this effective tax rate to our year-to-date pre-tax income. Each quarter, our estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if the estimated effective tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made. Additionally, the tax effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring items are recognized as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. The impact of changes in tax laws or rates on deferred tax amounts, impairments of non-deductible goodwill, excess benefits from stock-based compensation, and changes in tax reserves resulting from the finalization of tax audits or reviews are examples of significant unusual or infrequently occurring items that are recognized as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. There is a potential for volatility of the effective tax rate due to several factors, including changes in the mix of the pre-tax income and the jurisdictions to which it relates, changes in tax laws and foreign tax holidays, settlement with taxing authorities, and foreign currency fluctuations. 

Our effective income tax rate was 14.2% and 3.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2019 differed from the statutory federal rate of 21% primarily due to the benefit of share-based payment awards for employees, and research and development tax credits, partially offset by expenses for state income taxes, the limitations imposed by Section 162(m), and the foreign rate differential. 

Since we are subject to audit by various taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next 12 months. However, we do not expect the change, if any, to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations within the next 12 months.

Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies 

In February 2018, Dr. James L. Orrington II filed a putative civil class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, alleging that we sent unsolicited advertisements to telephone facsimile machines. The complaint included counts alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act, Conversion, Nuisance, and Trespass to Chattels. The plaintiff sought monetary damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. In January 2019, we received preliminary court approval of a class action settlement with Dr. James L. Orrington II and the class in the amount of $3,300, and we received final approval on May 28, 2019. We recorded the final settlement amount on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income during the year ended March 31, 2019 and a corresponding liability is included as legal liability on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We anticipate that we will pay the settlement amount of $3,300 during our quarter ending September 30, 2019.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Forward Looking Statements 

This report contains information that may constitute "forward-looking statements.” Generally, the words "believe," "expect," “will,” “estimate,” "anticipate," "intend," "project," and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events, or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to revenues growth and statements expressing general views about future operating results — are forward-looking statements. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those described in Part II, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2019, and those described from time to time in our subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

General Discussion 

We pursue a strategy of focusing primarily on quality control products and services, which are sold into niche markets that are driven by regulatory requirements. We prefer markets in which we can establish a strong presence and achieve high gross margins. We are organized into four divisions, or segments, across ten physical locations. Our Sterilization and Disinfection Control Division manufactures and sells biological, cleaning, and chemical indicators. Biological, cleaning, and chemical indicators are used to assess the effectiveness of sterilization and disinfection processes in the hospital, dental, medical device, and pharmaceutical industries. The division also provides testing and laboratory services, mainly to the dental industry. Our Instruments Division designs, manufactures, and markets quality control instruments and disposable products utilized in the healthcare, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, medical device, industrial hygiene, and environmental air sampling industries. Our Cold Chain Monitoring Division designs, develops, and markets systems which are used to monitor various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and differential pressure to ensure that critical storage and processing conditions are maintained in hospitals, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, blood banks, pharmacies, and laboratory environments. Our Cold Chain Packaging Division ("the Packaging Division"), which we plan to exit no later than March 31, 2020, provides thermal packaging products such as coolers, boxes, insulation materials, and phase-change products to control temperature during the customer’s transport of their own products. 

Our revenues come from product sales, which include hardware, software, and consumables; as well as services, which include installation, discrete maintenance services, and ongoing maintenance contracts. Product sales (hardware, software, and consumables) are dependent on several factors, including general economic conditions, both domestic and international, customer capital spending trends, competition, introduction of new products, and acquisitions. Sterilization and disinfection control products and most products in our Packaging Division are disposable and are used on a routine basis, thus product sales are less sensitive to general economic conditions. Instrument products and cold chain monitoring products and systems have a longer life, and their purchase by our customers is somewhat discretionary, so sales are more sensitive to general economic conditions. Cold chain monitoring and instruments products may be sold in conjunction with a perpetual or subscription-based software license, which may be required for the related hardware to function. Service demand is driven by our customers’ quality control and regulatory environments, which require periodic repair and recalibration or certification of our instrument products and cold chain monitoring systems. We typically evaluate costs and pricing annually. Our policy is to price our products competitively and, where possible, we pass along cost increases in order to maintain our margins. 

Gross profit is affected by our product mix, manufacturing efficiencies, and price competition. Historically, as we have integrated our acquisitions and taken advantage of manufacturing efficiencies, our gross margin percentages for some products have improved. There are, however, differences in gross margin percentages between product lines, and ultimately the mix of sales will continue to impact our overall gross margin. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2019, we completed a business combination (the “IBP Acquisition”) whereby we acquired the common stock of IBP Medical GmbH ("IBP"), a company whose business manufactures medical meters used to test various parameters of dialysis fluid (dialysate), and the proper calibration and operation of a dialysis machine. 


Table of Contents  

General Trends  

Our strategic financial objectives include growth both organically and through further acquisitions. During the three months ended June 30, 2019, we worked to maximize the efficiency of our operations to prepare for future growth, including relocating and consolidating most of the administrative functions of our Packaging Division from Markham, Canada to our corporate headquarters in Lakewood, Colorado; hiring key personnel to our operations and sales and marketing teams, and leveraging The Mesa Way, our customer-centric, lean-based system for continuously improving and operating a set of high-margin, niche businesses.  

The markets for sterilization and disinfection control products remain strong, as the disposable nature of these products makes them less sensitive to general economic conditions. The worldwide market for sterilization and disinfection control products is growing as more countries focus on verifying the effectiveness of sterilization and disinfection processes. 


We are working on several research and development projects that, if completed, may result in enhanced or new products for both existing customers and new markets. We are hopeful that we will have enhanced or new products and services available for sale in the coming year. 



As previously announced, during the year ended March 31, 2019, we made the decision to exit the packaging business by or before March 31, 2020. We have stopped providing consulting services, and we are no longer seeking or accepting new customers. We have reduced the division's costs by relocating most of the administrative functions to our headquarters in Lakewood, Colorado, and eliminating the division's sales force. Throughout the year ending March 31, 2020, we intend to assist our customers in transitioning their business to other packaging vendors.

Results of Operations 





Table of Contents  

Revenues 



Three months ended June 30, 2019 versus June 30, 2018 

Sterilization and Disinfection Control revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased 7% as a result of organic revenues growth, which was achieved primarily through volume increases with existing customers and modest price increases. Additionally, the comparable period ending June 30, 2018 was negatively affected by our inability to fulfill some of the division's orders on a timely basis as we completed the move of our Sterilization and Disinfection Control business into our new Bozeman, Montana facility. 

Instruments revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased 9%, due to organic revenues growth of 4% and the acquisition of IBP during the three months ended June 30, 2019.  

Cold Chain Monitoring revenues increased 3% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as a result of the acquisition of Point Six Wireless, LLC ("Point Six") in the prior year, partially offset by an organic revenues decline of 13%. The organic revenues decline was primarily due to a decrease of $501 of contracted revenues as compared to the prior year, as revenues from contract renewals were delayed due to the timing of implementation of certain product updates. Revenues in this division have historically fluctuated quarter over quarter due to the timing of performance obligations and the nature and timing of orders and installations within any given quarter. 

Cold Chain Packaging revenues decreased 28% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as a result of our decision to exit the business and cease accepting new customers, completing our sales contract with our largest customer, and our assisting of our current customers in transitioning their business to other vendors.  


Table of Contents  

Gross Profit  



Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 versus June 30, 2018 

Sterilization and Disinfection Control gross profit margin percentage increased slightly during the three months ended June 30, 2019 primarily as a result of efficiencies gained from higher sales volumes and to a lesser extent, as a result of modest price increases. 

Instruments gross margin percentage decreased 1 percentage point during the three months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to product and service mix. 


Table of Contents  

Cold Chain Monitoring gross profit percentage decreased 7 percentage points during the three months ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to lower than planned volumes along with the impact of the integration of the Point Six acquisition. As previously discussed, contracted revenues declined $501 compared to the prior year, as contract renewals were delayed due to the timing of implementation of certain product updates. Many of the costs associated with our contracted revenues, such as salaries expenses, are partially fixed, and as such, the lower contracted revenues resulted in lower margins during the three months ended June 30, 2019. Additionally, we have not completed the integration of the Point Six acquisition, which has resulted in increased costs on a per unit basis, but we expect it will be completed no later than March 31, 2020. After the integration is complete, we expect gross margin percentage for this division to be 40%- 45%. 

Cold Chain Packaging gross profit margin increased 15 percentage points during the three months ended June 30, 2019 primarily as a result of implementing price increases during the three months ended March 31, 2019 as part of our plan to exit the business by March 31, 2020. Also contributing to the increase were lower operating and personnel expenses and the completion of our sales contract with the division's largest customer which historically was one of our lower margin customers as a percentage of revenues.  

Operating Expenses 


Selling 

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 versus June 30, 2018 

Selling expense is driven primarily by labor costs, including salaries and commissions; accordingly, it may vary with sales levels. Selling expense increased 17% during the three months ended June 30, 2019, as we back-filled open sales and marketing positions and incurred higher professional services costs associated with investments in our technological infrastructure in an effort to modernize our marketing program. As a percentage of revenues, selling expense was 8% for both the three months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018. We plan to continue strategically investing in sales and marketing resources in order to further increase organic revenues growth. 

General and Administrative 

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 versus June 30, 2018 

Labor costs, including non-cash stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets drive the substantial majority of general and administrative expense. General and administrative expenses decreased 1% during the three months ended June 30, 2019, due primarily to decreased amortization of intangible assets as we wind down our Packaging Division, partially offset by increased equity-based compensation expense.  

Research and Development 

Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 versus June 30, 2018 

Research and development expense is predominantly comprised of labor costs and costs of third-party consultants. Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased 22%, due to increases in salary expense as we staff our engineering department to support the demands of our organic revenues growth strategy by making incremental investments in research and development to enhance existing products. 


Table of Contents  

Other Expense 

Other expense for the three months ended June 30, 2019 is composed primarily of interest expense associated with our Credit Facility, gains and losses on sales of property, plant and equipment, and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions.  

Net Income 

Our income tax rate varies based upon many factors but in general, we anticipate that on a go-forward basis, our effective tax rate will be approximately 26%, plus or minus the impact of excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with share-based payment awards to employees; see Note 8. “Income Taxes” within Item 1. Financial Statements for additional discussion. The excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with share-based payment awards to our employees have caused and, in the future, may cause large fluctuations in our realized effective tax rate based on timing, volume, and nature of stock options exercised under our share-based payment program. Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2019 varied with the changes in revenues, gross profit, and operating expenses (which includes $1,672 and $868 of non-cash amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation, respectively).  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, working capital, capacity under our Credit Facility, and potential equity and debt offerings. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term needs. Our more significant uses of resources have historically included long-term capital equipment expenditures, payment of debt obligations, quarterly dividends to shareholders, and acquisitions. Working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. We had working capital of $12,501 and $9,962 at June 30, 2019, and March 31, 2019, respectively. 

Given our cash flow projections and unused capacity on our line of credit that is available until March 1, 2022, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements for our general business needs. Interest-bearing debt of $20,000 and $23,000 was outstanding at June 30, 2019, and March 31, 2019, respectively. The Term Loan requires 20 quarterly principal payments, which began on March 31, 2017, in the amount of $250,000 (increasing by $125,000 each year up to $750,000 in the fifth year). The remaining balance of principal and accrued interest are due on March 1, 2022. We were in compliance with all loan agreements at June 30, 2019 and for all prior years presented and have met all debt payment obligations. 

We have recorded an estimated litigation accrual of $3,300 on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which we expect to pay during the three months ending September 30, 2019; see Note 9. “Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 1. Financial Statements. 

We routinely evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions. Future material acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital, assume third party debt or incur other long-term obligations. We believe that we have the option to utilize both equity and debt instruments as vehicles for the long-term financing of our investment activities and acquisitions. At June 30, 2019, we had $76,500 on unused capacity under our line of credit, subject to covenant restrictions. In addition, in June 2018, the SEC declared effective a shelf registration statement which allows us to sell, in one or more public offerings, common stock, warrants, or any combination of such securities for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to $300,000. The terms of any offering, including the type of securities involved, would be established at the time of sale.

Dividends 

We have paid regular quarterly dividends since 2003. We declared and paid dividends of $0.16 per share for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as well as each quarter for the year ending March 31, 2019. 

In July 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock, payable on September 16, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 30, 2019. 

Cash Flows 



Cash flows from operations were lower in the three months ended June 30, 2019 due to lower working capital, including the impact of adoption of ASU 842, as well as higher payments made for incentive compensation and federal income taxes. Cash used in investing increased as a result of the acquisition of IBP. Cash used in financing decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to June 30, 2018 due to lower debt repayments.  

Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments 

We are party to many contractual obligations that involve commitments to make payments to third parties in the ordinary course of business. For a description of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of March 31, 2019, see our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 3, 2019. During the current quarter, there were no material changes with respect to the nature of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments outside the ordinary course of business. At June 30, 2019, we had contractual obligations for open purchase orders of approximately $4,516 for routine purchases of supplies and inventory, which are payable in less than one year.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of June 30, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. These estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstance. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2019 in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We have no derivative instruments and minimal exposure to commodity market risks. A portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the U.S. and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the U.S. dollar. However, a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in U.S. dollars and therefore our foreign currency risk is not material at this date. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019 based on the framework in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at June 30, 2019.
