RICHARDSON ELECTRONICS REPORTS CONTINUED SALES GROWTH IN ITS SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2019 AND DECLARES QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND 


Second Quarter Results 

Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 5.7% to $41.3 million compared to net sales of $39.1 million in the prior year’s second quarter. Sales increased $2.2 million for PMT and $0.2 million for Richardson Healthcare. PMT sales were higher in power conversion and RF and microwave components. Sales increased for Richardson Healthcare due to higher CT Tube and equipment sales, partially offset by lower sales of diagnostic imaging parts. Sales decreased $0.2 million for Canvys due to lower overall demand across Europe. 

Gross margin decreased to $13.0 million, or 31.4% of net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to $13.4 million, or 34.2% of net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Margin decreased as a percent of net sales primarily due to a less favorable product mix, including a higher percentage of power conversion and RF and microwave components and pre-owned CT scanners, and unfavorable manufacturing variances in both PMT and Richardson Healthcare. Canvys margin as a percent of net sales increased primarily due to an improved product mix and lower costs on selected products sold. 

Operating expenses increased to $13.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to $12.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This increase was a result of $0.2 million of severance expense related to actions taken to improve the manufacturing variances, and $0.3 million in higher legal expenses. It is anticipated that the reduction in headcount will result in $0.5 million annualized savings in cost of sales. In addition, last year’s second quarter included a $0.2 million bad debt recovery. Operating expenses as a percent of net sales without the severance expense and the higher legal expenses decreased to 31.2% in the current quarter from 32.2% in last year’s second quarter.  

The Company reported an operating loss of $0.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to operating income of $0.8 million in the prior year’s second quarter. Excluding the severance expense and higher legal fees, the Company would have reported break-even for operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. 

Other income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily foreign exchange, was $0.3 million, compared to other expense of $0.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. 

The income tax provision of $0.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 reflected a provision for foreign income taxes and no U.S. tax benefit due to the valuation allowance recorded against the net operating loss. The tax provision of $0.5 million in last year’s second quarter included a provision for foreign income taxes, additional tax due from an audit in Germany and no U.S. tax benefit due to the valuation allowance recorded against the net operating loss. 

Loss from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.3 million, compared to an income from continuing operations of $0.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Excluding the severance and higher legal costs, profit from continuing operations would have been $0.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company received an income tax refund from the State of Illinois, inclusive of interest and net of professional fees, of $1.5 million. This refund was a result of the conclusion of the Illinois amended return related to the sale of RFPD in 2011 and was therefore, classified as income from discontinued operations. 

Net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.3 million, compared to a net income of $1.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.

OUTLOOK 

“We are pleased that our net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 grew by 5.7% from the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Unfortunately, our gross margin fell below expectations but we are taking actions to improve this” said Edward J. Richardson, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President. “We remain very optimistic about continued sales growth in PMT associated with our investments in new power and microwave technologies, as well as expanded market penetration for our ALTA750 TM CT Tube and improved gross margin for Healthcare,” Mr. Richardson concluded.
