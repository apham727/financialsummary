1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION 

Allied Motion Technologies Inc. (Allied Motion or the Company) is engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing and selling motion control solutions, which include integrated system solutions as well as individual motion control products, to a broad spectrum of customers throughout the world primarily for the commercial motor, industrial motion, automotive control, medical, and aerospace and defense markets. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The assets and liabilities of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using end of period exchange rates. Changes in reported amounts of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that occur as a result of changes in exchange rates between foreign subsidiaries functional currencies and the U.S. dollar are included in foreign currency translation adjustment. Foreign currency translation adjustment is included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Revenue and expense transactions use an average rate prevailing during the month of the related transaction. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of each Technology Unit (TU) are included in the results of operations as incurred. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and include all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The Company believes that the disclosures herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The financial data for the interim periods may not necessarily be indicative of results to be expected for the year. 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

It is suggested that the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to such statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 that was previously filed by the Company. 

Reclassifications 

Certain items in the prior years consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2018 presentation. 


As part of the growth strategy of the Company, on January 19, 2018, the Company purchased substantially all of the operating assets associated with the original equipment steering business of Maval Industries, LLC (Maval) for $13,312 in cash. Consistent with the Companys strategy to provide higher level system solutions, the addition of the Maval OE steering (Maval OE Steering) product line enables Allied to provide a fully integrated steering system solution to its customers.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. None of the goodwill recognized is deductible for income tax purposes. The purchase price allocation is subject to further adjustment to reflect, among other things, any adjustments in accordance with the Purchase Agreement and finalization of the opening balance sheet, including adjustments for final valuations, including intangible assets. 


Performance Obligations 

Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time 

The Companys standard delivery method is free on board shipping point. Consequently, the Company considers control of most products to transfer at a single point in time when control is transferred to the customer, generally when the products are shipped in accordance with an agreement and purchase order. 

The Company satisfies its performance obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring goods and services in exchange for consideration from the customer. For some customers, control, and a sale, is transferred at a point in time when the product is delivered to a customer. 

Sales, value add, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. 

Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time 

The Company has certain contracts that have performance obligations that are satisfied over periods exceeding one year. Determining a measure of progress requires management to make judgments that affect the timing of revenue recognized. 

For a contract satisfied over time, revenue is recognized similarly to contracts satisfied at a point in time. The Company transfers control and recognizes a sale when the Company ships the product from a manufacturing facility to a customer. The only difference is that the shipments are not completed within a one-year timeframe. The revenue recognized for the contracts satisfied over time were immaterial for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. 

The Company has determined that the above methods provide a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods to the customer. 

Nature of Goods and Services 



Table of Contents 

ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES INC. 

UNAUDITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


Determining the Transaction Price 

The majority of the Companys contracts have an original duration of less than one year. For these contracts, the Company applies the practical expedient and therefore does not consider the effects of the time value of money. For multiyear contracts, the Company uses judgment to determine whether there is a significant financing component. These contracts are generally those in which the customer has made an up-front payment. Contracts that management determines to include a significant financing component are discounted at the Companys incremental borrowing rate. The Company incurs interest expense and accretes a contract liability. As the Company satisfies performance obligations and recognizes revenue from these contracts, interest expense is recognized simultaneously. Management does not have any contracts that include a significant financing component as of March 31, 2018. 

Disaggregation of Revenue 

The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers into geographical regions and target markets. The Company determines that disaggregating revenue into these categories achieves the disclosure objective to depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. As noted in the segment information footnote, the Companys business consists of one reportable segment. A reconciliation of disaggregated revenue to segment revenue as well as revenue by geographical regions is provided in Note 16, Segment Information. 



Contract Balances 

When the timing of the Companys delivery of product is different from the timing of the payments made by customers, the Company recognizes either a contract asset (performance precedes customer payment) or a contract liability (customer payment precedes performance). Typically, contracts are paid in arrears and are recognized as receivables after the Company considers whether a significant financing component exists. 



The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Companys contract assets and contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between the Companys performance and the customers payment. 


Table of Contents 

ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES INC. 

UNAUDITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


Significant Payment Terms 

The Companys contracts with its customers state the final terms of the sale, including the description, quantity, and price of each product or service purchased. Payments are typically due in full within 30-60 days of delivery. Since the customer agrees to a stated rate and price in the contract that do not vary over the contract, the majority of contracts do not contain variable consideration. 

Returns, Refunds, and Warranties 

In the normal course of business, the Company does not accept product returns unless the item is defective as manufactured. The Company establishes provisions for estimated returns and warranties. All contracts include a standard warranty clause to guarantee that the product complies with agreed specifications. 

Practical Expedients 

Incremental costs of obtaining a contract - the Company elected to expense the incremental costs of obtaining a contract when the amortization period for such contracts would have been one year or less. 

Remaining performance obligations - Company elected not to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for its contracts that are one year or less, as the revenue is expected to be recognized within the next year. 

The time value of money - the Company elected not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money for contracts in which the anticipated period between when the Company transfers the goods or services to the customer and when the customer pays is equal to one year or less.

Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of the Mavel OE Steering business were approximately $3,700 (Note 2). The intangible assets acquired consist of customer lists (the valuation and useful life of which have not been finalized). 

Amortization expense for intangible assets was $884 and $793 for the quarters ending March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 




Stock Incentive Plans 

The Companys Stock Incentive Plans provide for the granting of stock awards, including restricted stock, stock options and stock appreciation rights, to employees and non-employees, including directors of the Company. 

Restricted Stock 

For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, 48,492 shares of unvested restricted stock were awarded at a weighted average market value of $32.63. Of the restricted shares granted, 30,603 shares have performance based vesting conditions. The value of the shares is amortized to compensation expense over the related service period, which is normally three years, or over the estimated performance period. Shares of unvested restricted stock generally are forfeited if a recipient leaves the Company before the vesting date. Shares that are forfeited become available for future awards.

Stock based compensation expense, net of forfeitures of $496 and $466 was recorded for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 








Credit Agreement 

On October 28, 2016, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) for a $125,000 revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility). The Revolving Facility includes a $50,000 accordion amount and has an initial term of five years. HSBC Bank USA, National Association is the administrative agent, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. is the sole lead arranger and sole book runner, and Keybank National Association and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association are co-syndication agents. 

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to terms defined in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings bear

ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES INC. 

UNAUDITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


interest at the LIBOR Rate plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25%, in each case depending on the Companys ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA (the Total Leverage Ratio). At March 31, 2018, the applicable margin for LIBOR Rate borrowings was 1.50% and the applicable margin for Prime Rate borrowings was 0.50%. In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of between 0.10% and 0.25% quarterly (currently 0.125%) on the unused portion of the Revolving facility, also based on the Companys Total Leverage Ratio. 

The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to minimum interest coverage and total leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. The Credit Agreement also includes other covenants and restrictions, including limits on the amount of additional indebtedness, and restrictions on the Companys ability to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2018. 

Other 

The China Facility provides credit of approximately $1,592 (Chinese Renminbi (RMB) 10,000). The China Facility is used for working capital and capital equipment needs at the Companys China operations. The average balance for 2018 was $476 (RMB 3,000). At March 31, 2018, there was approximately $1,114 (RMB 7,000) available under the facility. 

11. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The Company is exposed to certain risk arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Companys derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Companys known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Companys investments and borrowings. 

The Companys objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. During October 2013, the Company entered into two identical interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 that amortize quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at the September 2018 maturity. One of these interest rate swaps is currently active. The Company terminated the other interest rate swap during October 2016 as part of its debt refinancing. In February 2017, the Company entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022. 

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During 2018 and 2017, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. There was no hedge ineffectiveness recorded in the Companys earnings during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. 

During 2018, the Company estimates that an additional $70 will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense. Additionally, the Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges.

The income tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of the annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, the estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if the estimated effective tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made. There is a potential for volatility of the effective tax rate due to several factors, including changes in the mix of the pre-tax income and the jurisdictions to which it relates, changes in tax laws, settlements with taxing authorities and foreign currency fluctuations. 

The effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes was 26.2% and 31.0% in the first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 is net of a discrete tax benefit of (2.3%), related to the recognition of excess tax benefits for share-based payment awards. 

The effective rate before discrete items varies from the statutory rate due to permanent differences in state taxes and the difference in US and foreign tax rates and the mix of foreign and domestic income. 

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The provision of the Act reduces the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. 

The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. The Company is applying the guidance in SAB 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the Act. At March 31, 2018, the Company has not completed the accounting for all of the tax effects of the Act; however, in certain cases, as described below, aspects of the accounting are complete. Additionally, the Company has made a reasonable estimate of other effects. In other cases, the Company has not been able to make a reasonable estimate and continue to account for those items based on existing accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes, and the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to enactment. As further discussed below, during the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, the Company did not recognize any adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded at December 31, 2017. In all cases, the Company will continue to make and refine our calculations as additional analysis is completed. Estimates may also be affected as we gain a more thorough understanding of the tax law. These changes could be material to income tax expense. 

The Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. The provisional amount of $(7) was recorded as of December 31, 2017 related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax balances. Upon further analyses of certain aspects of the Act and refinement of the calculations during the three months ended March 31, 2018, we have not adjusted the provisional amount. The Company considers the enactment-date remeasurement of all other deferred tax assets and liabilities to be complete.

For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, there were 74,067 and 2,187 common shares subject to equity-based awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as they would be anti-dilutive. 


ASC Topic Segment Reporting requires disclosure of operating segments, which as defined, are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. 


The Companys wholly owned foreign subsidiaries, located in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Portugal, China and Mexico are included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 



Identifiable foreign assets were $89,537 and $84,652 as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. 

Revenues derived from foreign subsidiaries and identifiable assets outside of the United States are primarily attributable to Europe. 

Sales to customers outside of the United States by all subsidiaries were $36,302 and $28,170 during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

For first quarter 2018 and 2017, one customer accounted for 21% and 19% of revenues, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017 this customer accounted for 23% and 15% of trade receivables. 

17. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers which is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model. Under ASU 2014-09, a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. We adopted ASU 2014-09 and its amendments on a modified retrospective basis effective January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A significant majority of our revenue is recorded when we invoice customers and is largely aligned with the meeting of identified 


Table of Contents 

ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES INC. 

UNAUDITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


performance obligations under ASU 2014-09. There is no material change in our revenue recognition after the implementation of the standard. 




Recently issued accounting pronouncements 

In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, to address a specific consequence of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) by allowing a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the TCJAs reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. The ASU is effective for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the TCJA is recognized. Management has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the ASU on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. 



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and creates Topic 842, Leases. The new topic supersedes Topic 840, Leases, and increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires disclosures of key information

ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES INC.

about leasing arrangements. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition method. The Company is currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Overview 


Financial overview 

Significantly higher revenues, reflecting growth across all the Companys served markets led to leveraging of costs and expansion of margins. Excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange (FX), first quarter revenue was $72.5 million, up 18%. 

We remain focused on executing our strategy for growth while streamlining the organization and emphasizing continuous improvement in quality, delivery, cost and innovation as we drive the One Allied approach and expand our value proposition for our customers. Solid strides continue to be made with our multi-product, fully integrated solutions that are leading to increased business. Also, we continue to build a pipeline of exciting market-based application opportunities. Sales cycles

are long and the time from being selected for the solution development to full rate production can be longer, yet we believe we are building a scalable foundation which can deliver strong returns on those investments. 

Operating Results 

Quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to quarter ended March 31, 2017 






Table of Contents 

Sales to U.S. customers were 53% of total sales for the quarter compared with 54% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia. The overall increase in revenue was due to an 18% volume increase and a 7% favorable currency impact. 









Non-GAAP Measures 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. 

Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results; in particular, those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, and that are not a helpful measure of the performance of our underlying business particularly in light of their unpredictable nature. This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. In addition, supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Companys future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. 


Table of Contents 

The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense. EBITDA is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the Companys industry. 

The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business. Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock compensation expense, as well as certain income or expenses which are not indicative of the ongoing performance of the Company. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 



Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Companys liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2,587 to a balance of $13,003 at March 31, 2018 from December 31, 2017. 


The decrease in operating cash flows during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 2017 is due to increased working capital needs, related to both the acquisition of the Mavel OE Steering business, and organic growth. 

The significant cash used in investing activities in 2018 reflects the acquisition the Mavel OE Steering business during the quarter. Also during the first quarter of 2018, purchases of property and equipment were $2,222 compared to $1,288 for the first quarter of 2017. Capital expenditures are expected to increase throughout 2018 to support our new contract wins along with our continued IT infrastructure enhancements. 

The change in cash used in financing activities reflects the 2018 use of the revolver to partially finance the acquisition of the Mavel OE Steering business. Also, during the first quarter of 2018, we made payments of $4,350 for our Revolving Facility, including $1,850 to completely pay off our foreign revolver. At March 31, 2018, we had $63,462 of obligations under the Revolving Facility. 

The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to minimum interest coverage and total leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. The Credit Agreement also includes other covenants and restrictions, including limits on the amount

of additional indebtedness, and restrictions on the ability to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets. We were in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2018. 

As of March 31, 2018, the amount available to borrow under the Credit Agreement was approximately $61,538. 

There were no additional borrowings for the China Facility balance for the first quarter of 2018 from December 31, 2017. The balance at March 31, 2018 was $478 (RMB 13,000), and the available borrowings were approximately $1,114 (RMB 7,000). 

The Company declared dividends of $0.025 per share during the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Companys working capital, capital expenditure and dividend requirements are expected to be funded from cash provided by operations and amounts available under the Credit Agreement. 

Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Foreign Currency 

We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively. We continuously evaluate our foreign currency risk and will take action from time to time in order to best mitigate these risks. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $3,200 on our first quarter 2018 sales. This amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to partially offsetting impacts on cost of sales and operating expenses in those currencies. We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased sales in comparison to quarter ended March 31, 2017 by approximately $4,000. 

We translate all assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency, at the period-end exchange rate and translate sales and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income. The translation adjustment was a gain of approximately $600 and $700 for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Translation adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to a loss of $138 and $70 for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,300 on our foreign net assets as of March 31, 2018. 

Interest Rates 

Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 1.50%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 0.50%), in each case depending on the Companys ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA. We use interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 (representing 50% of the Term Loan balance at that time) that amortize quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at maturity. The notional amount changes over time as loan payments are made. As a requirement of the debt refinance, one of the swaps was liquidated. In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022. 

As of March 31, 2018, we had $63,462 outstanding under the Revolving Facility, of which $43,985 is currently being hedged. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our outstanding debt. A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) change in the Base Rate on the $18,943 of unhedged floating rate debt outstanding at March 31, 2018 would have an impact of approximately $49 on our interest expense for the first quarter 2018.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (principal accounting officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of March 31, 2018. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

Based on managements evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2018, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting 

The Company implemented a financial reporting system, Hyperion Financial Management (HFM), as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes. The implementation occurred in phases throughout 2017 and was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company utilized and relied on HFM during the first quarter of 2018. 

As a result of the HFM implementation, certain changes to our processes and procedures have and will continue to occur. These changes will result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. While HFM is designed to strengthen our internal financial controls by automating certain manual processes and standardizing business processes and reporting across our organization, management will continue to evaluate and monitor our internal controls as each of the affected areas evolve. 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, with the exception of the addition of the Maval OE Steering business, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Note regarding acquisition 

In making our assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2018, we have excluded the operations of the Maval OE Steering business. We are currently assessing the control environment of this acquired business. Our consolidated financial statements reflect the Maval OE Steering business results of operations from January 19, 2018.
