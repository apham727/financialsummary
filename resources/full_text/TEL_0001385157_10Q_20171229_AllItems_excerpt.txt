  1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Pronouncements   

  Basis of Presentation   

 The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity" or the "Company," which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") and the instructions to Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In management's opinion, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of interim results. The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire fiscal year or any subsequent interim period.  

 The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017.  

 Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 are to our fiscal years ending September 28, 2018 and ended September 29, 2017, respectively.   

  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement   

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09 which codified Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This guidance supersedes ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition, and introduces a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model. ASC 606 also enhances disclosures related to revenue recognition. ASC 606, as amended, is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2019, and we intend to adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective approach applied to contracts that are not completed as of that date. We are continuing to assess the impact of adopting ASC 606. Based on the ongoing evaluation of our current contracts and revenue streams, we do not expect that adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. We are in the process of identifying necessary changes to accounting policies, processes, financial statement disclosures, internal controls, and systems to enable compliance with this new standard. We believe we are following an appropriate timeline to allow for the proper recognition, reporting, and disclosure of revenue upon adoption of ASC 606 at the beginning of fiscal 2019.   

  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement   

 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, an update to ASC 715, CompensationRetirement Benefits, which changes the income statement presentation of net periodic pension benefit cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The ASU requires that service costs be presented with other employee compensation costs within operating income and that other cost components be presented outside of operating income. We elected to early adopt this update in the quarter ended December 29, 2017. The update was applied retrospectively and did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

  2. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net (Continued)   


 During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions segment. In connection with this program, during the quarter ended December 29, 2017, we recorded restructuring charges of $22 million. We expect to complete significantly all restructuring actions commenced during the quarter ended December 29, 2017 by the end of fiscal 2019 and to incur total charges of approximately $30 million with the remaining charges primarily in the Industrial Solutions segment.   


 During fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting all segments. In connection with this program, during the quarters ended December 29, 2017 and December 30, 2016, we recorded restructuring charges of $5 million and $46 million, respectively. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2017 by the end of fiscal 2019 and to incur total charges of approximately $160 million with the remaining charges primarily in the Communications Solutions segment.   


 Prior to fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment. During the quarter ended December 29, 2017, we recorded net restructuring charges of $8 million related to pre-fiscal 2017 actions. We expect to incur additional charges of approximately $15 million related to pre-fiscal 2017 actions with the remaining charges primarily in the Communications Solutions segment.

  5. Intangible Assets, Net (Continued)  




 During October 2017, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our 100%-owned subsidiary, repaid, at maturity, $708 million 6.55% senior notes due 2017.  

 During the quarter ended December 29, 2017, we reclassified $325 million of 2.375% senior notes due 2018 from long-term debt to short-term debt on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

 During December 2017, TEGSA entered into an uncommitted revolving credit facility under which it borrowed €100 million, at a 0% interest rate with repayment due at maturity in December 2018.  

 As of December 29, 2017, TEGSA had $241 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 1.96%. TEGSA had no commercial paper outstanding at September 29, 2017.  

 The fair value of our debt, based on indicative valuations, was approximately $4,298 million and $4,622 million at December 29, 2017 and September 29, 2017, respectively.  

  7. Commitments and Contingencies   

  Legal Proceedings   

 In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.   

  Environmental Matters   

 We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given  


Table of Contents 

 TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.  

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued)  

  7. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)  

the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. As of December 29, 2017, we concluded that it was probable that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the range of $15 million to $44 million, and that the best estimate within this range was $19 million. We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.   

  Guarantees   


 At December 29, 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $291 million.  

 We generally record estimated product warranty costs when contract revenues are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method for construction related contracts; other warranty reserves are not significant. The estimation is based primarily on historical experience and actual warranty claims. Amounts accrued for warranty claims were $49 million and $50 million at December 29, 2017 and September 29, 2017, respectively.   

  Tax Sharing Agreement   

 As previously reported, under a Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International plc ("Tyco International"), and Covidien plc ("Covidien") share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to the collective income tax returns for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. We have substantially settled all U.S. federal income tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service for periods covered under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Certain shared U.S. state and non-U.S. income tax matters remain open. We do not expect these matters will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

These foreign exchange gains and losses were recorded as currency translation, a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting changes attributable to the translation of the net investment.  




 The components of net periodic pension benefit cost other than service cost are included in other income (expense), net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  

 During the quarter ended December 29, 2017, we contributed $13 million to our non-U.S. pension plans.

 TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.  

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued)  


 We recorded income tax expense of $600 million and $54 million for the quarters ended December 29, 2017 and December 30, 2016, respectively. The income tax expense for the quarter ended December 29, 2017 included $567 million of income tax expense related to the tax impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") and a $61 million net income tax benefit related to certain legal entity restructurings. See "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" below for additional information. The income tax expense for the quarter ended December 30, 2016 included a $30 million income tax benefit associated with the tax impacts of certain intercompany restructurings and the corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance for U.S. tax loss carryforwards.  

 We record accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense. As of December 29, 2017 and September 29, 2017, we had $62 million and $60 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, recorded primarily in income taxes. During the quarter ended December 29, 2017, we recognized $2 million of income tax expense related to interest and penalties on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.  

 Although it is difficult to predict the timing or results of our worldwide examinations, we estimate that up to approximately $40 million of unrecognized income tax benefits, excluding the impact relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months.  

 We are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 29, 2017.   

  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act   

 On December 22, 2017, the President of the U.S. signed the Act into law. The Act includes numerous significant changes to existing tax law, including a permanent reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, further limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation, repeal of the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, and imposition of a territorial tax system with a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. While some of the new provisions of the Act will impact us in fiscal 2019 and beyond, the change in the corporate income tax rate was effective January 1, 2018. During the quarter ended December 29, 2017, we were required to revalue our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate income tax rate in the period of enactment; accordingly, we recorded additional income tax expense of $567 million primarily to write-down our net U.S. federal deferred tax asset to the lower statutory tax rate. Most of this charge related to the revaluation of our U.S. federal net operating loss and interest carryforwards to the lower tax rate. Included in the $567 million charge was a $34 million benefit related to the reduction in the existing valuation allowance recorded against certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards. The limitations on interest expense deductions contained in the Act are expected to increase prospective taxable income and thereby allow the utilization of more tax credits in future years. As a Swiss corporation, the one-time repatriation tax imposed by the Act will not be significant to us. Also, we do not expect a change in our fiscal 2018 cash taxes because of the new law.  

 The Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, and in certain instances, lacks clarity and is subject to interpretation until additional Internal Revenue Service guidance is issued. The

  10. Income Taxes (Continued)  

ultimate impact of the Act may differ from our estimates due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions we made as well as any forthcoming regulatory guidance. One area requiring guidance is a transition rule regarding limitations on interest expense deductions. The Act does not address the treatment of the carryforward of disallowed interest expense generated under the prior law. Our interpretation is that the carryforward of interest should survive and is deductible in future periods subject to the new interest limitations. Accordingly, during the quarter ended December 29, 2017, we revalued our beginning deferred tax asset related to our interest carryforwards to $223 million to reflect the lower statutory rate. It is possible additional regulatory guidance could be issued contrary to this interpretation at which point we may be required to record a charge to income tax expense to revalue or eliminate the related deferred tax asset.  

  11. Earnings (Loss) Per Share  



 There were one million and two million share options that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share for the quarters ended December 29, 2017 and December 30, 2016, respectively, because the instruments' underlying exercise prices were greater than the average market prices of our common shares and inclusion would be antidilutive.  

 For the quarter ended December 29, 2017, there were three million nonvested share awards and options outstanding with underlying exercise prices less than the average market prices of our common shares; however, these were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as inclusion would be antidilutive as a result of our loss during the period.  


  Dividends   

 We paid a cash dividend of $0.40 per share during the quarter ended December 29, 2017.  

 Upon shareholders' approval of a dividend payment, we record a liability with a corresponding charge to shareholders' equity. At December 29, 2017 and September 29, 2017, the unpaid portion of the dividends recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $140 million and $281 million, respectively.

 At December 29, 2017, we had $1,766 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.  




 As of December 29, 2017, there was $204 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to share-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.  



 As of December 29, 2017, we had 20 million shares available for issuance under our stock and incentive plans, of which the TE Connectivity Ltd. 2007 Stock and Incentive Plan, amended and restated as of March 8, 2017, was the primary plan.

     ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading "Forward-Looking Information" and "Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors."  

 Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").  

 The following discussion includes organic net sales growth which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure, together with GAAP financial measures, provides useful information to investors because it is one of the financial measures that management uses in evaluating the underlying results of our operations. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure" for more information about this non-GAAP financial measure, including our reasons for including the measure and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measure.  

 Overview 

 TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity" or the "Company," which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") is a global technology and manufacturing leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. For more than 75 years, our connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, have enabled advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home.  


 Our net sales increased 13.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with sales growth in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments, partially offset by declines in the Communications Solutions segment. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $115 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2017. On an organic basis, our net sales increased 7.9% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  


Transportation SolutionsOur net sales increased 21.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result of sales increases in all end markets.   

Industrial SolutionsOur net sales increased 10.9% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due primarily to increased sales in the industrial equipment end market.   

Communications SolutionsOur net sales decreased 4.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 with sales declines in the subsea communications end market, partially offset by sales increases in the appliances and, to a lesser degree, the data and devices end markets.   

 Net cash provided by operating activities was $350 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.   

  Outlook  

 In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect our net sales to be between $3.55 billion and $3.65 billion as compared to $3.2 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This increase reflects sales growth in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments, and to a lesser degree, the  


Table of Contents 


Transportation SolutionsWe expect our net sales increase in the automotive end market to exceed anticipated global automotive production growth of approximately 2% due primarily to increased content per vehicle, market share gains, and sales contributions from a recent acquisition. We also expect continued growth in the commercial transportation and sensors end markets.  

Industrial SolutionsWe expect our net sales to increase in the industrial equipment end market due primarily to continued growth in the factory automation and controls market and the medical market. 

Communications SolutionsWe expect our net sales growth in the appliances and the data and devices end markets to be partially offset by sales declines in the subsea communications end market.   

We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.22 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This outlook reflects the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $123 million and $0.06 per share, respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  


Transportation SolutionsWe expect our net sales to increase in the automotive end market due primarily to increased content per vehicle, market share gains, and sales contributions from a recent acquisition. We expect global automotive production to increase approximately 2% in fiscal 2018. We also expect continued growth in the commercial transportation and sensors end markets.  

Industrial SolutionsWe expect our net sales to increase in the industrial equipment end market primarily as a result of growth in the factory automation and controls market and the medical market. 

Communications SolutionsWe expect our net sales growth in the appliances and the data and devices end markets to be offset by sales declines in the subsea communications end market. We expect our sales in the subsea communications end market to be approximately $800 million in fiscal 2018.   

We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.61 to $3.71 per share in fiscal 2018. This outlook reflects the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $228 million and $0.11 per share, respectively, in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017.  

 The above outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.  

 We are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. We continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital

availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs. See further discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  

 Results of Operations 

  Net Sales  





 Net sales increased $417 million, or 13.6%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales resulted from organic net sales growth of 7.9%, the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 3.7% due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies, and sales contributions from acquisitions of 2.0%. Price erosion adversely affected organic net sales by $44 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  

 See further discussion of net sales below under "Segment Results."  


 Approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  


Table of Contents 






  Cost of Sales and Gross Margin  



 Gross margin increased $110 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to higher volume and improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset by the negative impact of price erosion. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 33.8% in the first quarter of 2018 from 34.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  

 Cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices which continue to fluctuate for many of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. We expect to purchase approximately 200 million pounds of copper, 140,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.7 million troy  


Table of Contents 



  Operating Expenses  



 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $16 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase resulted primarily from increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 11.0% in the first quarter of 2018 from 12.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  

 Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, research, development, and engineering expenses increased $20 million as compared to the same period of fiscal 2017 due to costs related to growth initiatives, primarily in the Transportation Solutions segment.  

 Restructuring and Other Charges, Net. We are committed to continuous productivity improvements and consistently evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth.  

 During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions segment. During fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting all segments.  

 In connection with these initiatives, we incurred net restructuring charges of $35 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, of which $22 million related to the fiscal 2018 restructuring program. Annualized cost savings related to fiscal 2018 actions commenced during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $20 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2019. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. During fiscal 2018, we expect to incur net restructuring charges of approximately $150 million. We

 Segment Results 

  Transportation Solutions  







AutomotiveOur organic net sales increased 10.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 with growth of 14.5% in the Americas region, 13.3% in the EMEA region, and 6.2% in the AsiaPacific region. In the Americas region, our organic net sales increased due to content growth in North America and continued market recovery in South America. Our growth in the EMEA region was driven by market growth, electronification, and new model launches. Our growth in the AsiaPacific region resulted from market share gains and electronification.  

Commercial transportationOur organic net sales increased 34.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, with growth in the heavy truck, construction, and agriculture markets and sales increases across all regions.  

SensorsOur organic net sales increased 10.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due primarily to growth in the commercial transportation, industrial equipment, and automotive markets.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the payment of $325 million of 2.375% senior notes due in 2018. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt, including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions.  

  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

 In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $54 million to $350 million from $404 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in employee-compensation related payments, partially offset by higher pre-tax income levels.  

 The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the first quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017 was $82 million and $96 million, respectively.  

  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  

 Capital expenditures were $241 million and $130 million in the first quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect fiscal 2018 capital spending levels to be approximately 5% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.

  Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization  

 Total debt at December 29, 2017 and September 29, 2017 was $4,005 million and $4,344 million, respectively. See Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.  

 During October 2017, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our 100%-owned subsidiary, repaid, at maturity, $708 million 6.55% senior notes due 2017.  

 During December 2017, TEGSA entered into an uncommitted revolving credit facility under which it borrowed €100 million, at a 0% interest rate with repayment due at maturity in December 2018.  

 TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with a maturity date of December 2020 and total commitments of $1,500 million. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 29, 2017 or September 29, 2017. Borrowings under our commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility and reduce the availability of funds from the Credit Facility.  

 The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of December 29, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.  

 In addition to the Credit Facility, TEGSA is the borrower under our senior notes and commercial paper. TEGSA's payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.  

 Payments of common share dividends to shareholders were $141 million and $132 million in the first quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.  

 During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, our board of directors authorized an increase of $1.5 billion in the share repurchase program. We repurchased approximately 2 million of our common shares for $214 million and approximately 2 million of our common shares for $102 million under our share repurchase program during the first quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 29, 2017, we had $1,766 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.  

 Commitments and Contingencies 

  Legal Proceedings  

 In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  

  Guarantees  

 In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with  


Table of Contents 

end dates ranging from fiscal 2018 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  


 At December 29, 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $291 million.  

  Tax Sharing Agreement  

 As previously reported, we are a party to a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs our, Tyco International plc's, and Covidien plc's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations with respect to taxes for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement.  

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

 The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses.  

 Our accounting policies for revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and pension liabilities are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management. For additional information regarding these policies and the underlying accounting assumptions and estimates used in these policies, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017. There were no significant changes to this information during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  

 Accounting Pronouncements 

 See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.  

 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

  Organic Net Sales Growth  

 We present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.  


Table of Contents 

 Organic net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance. Also, management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The tables presented in "Results of Operations" and "Segment Results" provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with GAAP.  

 Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.
