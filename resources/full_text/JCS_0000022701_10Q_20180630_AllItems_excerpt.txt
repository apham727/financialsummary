NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Description of Business 

Communications Systems, Inc. (herein collectively referred to as “CSI,” “our,” “we” or the “Company”) is a Minnesota corporation organized in 1969 that operates directly and through its subsidiaries located in the United States (U.S.) and the United Kingdom (U.K.). CSI is principally engaged through its Suttle, Inc. (“Suttle”) subsidiary and business unit in the manufacture and sale of connectivity infrastructure products for broadband and voice communications, and through its Transition Networks, Inc. (“Transition Networks” or “Transition”) subsidiary and business unit in the manufacture and sale of core media conversion products, Ethernet switches, and other connectivity and data transmission products. Through its JDL Technologies, Inc. (“JDL Technologies” or “JDL”) business unit, CSI provides technology solutions including virtualization, managed services, wired and wireless network design and implementation, and hybrid cloud infrastructure and deployment. Through its Net2Edge Limited (“Net2Edge”) U.K.-based business unit, the Company develops, manufactures and sells products that enable telecommunications carriers to connect legacy networks to high-speed services. 

The Company classifies its businesses into four segments corresponding to the Suttle, Transition Networks, JDL Technologies and Net2Edge business units. Non-allocated general and administrative expenses are separately accounted for as “Other” in the Company’s segment reporting. Intersegment revenues are eliminated upon consolidation. 

Financial Statement Presentation 

The condensed consolidated balance sheets and condensed consolidated statement of changes in stockholders’ equity as of June 30, 2018 and the related condensed consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss, and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 have been prepared by Company management. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments, except where noted) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows at June 30, 2018 and 2017 and for the periods then ended have been made. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. We recommend these condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s December 31, 2017 Annual Report to Shareholders on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the period ended June 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year. 

The presentation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates and assumptions used in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are based upon management’s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the time of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 


Except to the extent updated or described below, the significant accounting policies set forth in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, appropriately represent, in all material respects, the current status of accounting policies, and are incorporated herein by reference. 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 



NOTE 2 – REVENUE RECOGNITION 

The Company adopted ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. The reported results for 2018 reflect the application of ASC 606 guidance while the reported results for 2017 were prepared under the guidance of ASC 605, “Revenue Recognition” (ASC 605), which is also referred to herein as “legacy GAAP” or the “previous guidance”. The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the delivery of the Company’s goods and services and will provide financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures. In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods or services. 


The Company’s Suttle business unit manufactures and markets a broad range of products that support broadband and telephone service under the Suttle brand name in the United States and internationally. Suttle markets its outside plant and premise distribution products globally to telecommunications companies, service providers, residential builders, and low-voltage installers through distributors and the Company’s sales staff. Suttle’s customers include telephone, CATV, internet service providers, distributors, and enterprise networks. 


The Company’s Transition Networks business unit sells media converter devices, NIDs, Ethernet switches and other connectivity products that make it possible to transmit telecommunications signals across networks and between systems using various types of media. Transition sells its products through distributors, resellers, integrators, and OEMs. 

The Company has determined that the performance obligation for its Suttle and Transition Networks divisions is the Company’s connectivity infrastructure and data transmission products. To determine when revenue should be recognized, it is important to determine when the transfer of control has occurred. The Company has determined that control transfers for these products upon shipment or delivery to the customer, in accordance with the agreed upon shipping terms. As such, the timing of revenue recognition occurs at a specific point in time. 

JDL Technologies, Inc. 

The Company’s JDL Technologies, Inc. division is a managed service provider and a value-added reseller supplying IT solutions focused on IT service and support management; network design, deployment and integration; cloud, hosted and virtualized services; and network operations center management. Major technology solutions include networking, virtualization, cloud and infrastructure services, most of which are available under JDL managed service contracts. 


The Company has also identified the following performance obligations within its JDL Technologies division that are recognized at a point in time which include resale of third-party hardware and software, installation, arranging for another party to transfer services to the customer, and certain professional services. The resale of third-party hardware and software is recognized at a point in time, when the goods are shipped or delivered to the customer’s location, in accordance with the shipping terms. Installation services are recognized at a point in time when the services are completed. The service the Company provides to arrange for another party to transfer services to the customer is satisfied at a point in time as the Company has transferred control upon the service first being made available to the customer by the third party vendor, which are required to be presented on a net basis. Depending on the nature of the service, certain professional services transfer control at a point in time. The Company evaluates these circumstances on a case by case basis to determine if revenue should be recognized over time or at a point in time. 


The Company’s Net2Edge division manufactures and markets Ethernet based network access devices. The Company principally sells its products through approved partners and integrators outside the United States. The Company has determined that the performance obligation in the Net2Edge division is its connectivity infrastructure and data transmission products that are recognized at a point in time. 


Significant Judgments 

In order to determine the transaction price, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration at the outset of the contract, depending on the facts and circumstances relative to the contract. The Company may provide credits or incentives to its customers, which are accounted for as either variable consideration or consideration payable to the customer. The Company estimates product returns based on historical return rates. The Company constrains (reduces) the estimates of variable consideration such that it is probable that a significant revenue reversal of previously recognized revenue will not occur throughout the life of the contract. When determining if variable consideration should be constrained, management considers whether there are factors outside the Company’s control that could result in a significant reversal of revenue. In making these assessments, the Company considers the likelihood and magnitude of a potential reversal of revenue. The Company will assess if any incentives it offers to its customer is a consideration payable. The Company accounts for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of the transaction price, and therefore, of revenue. For contracts with more than one performance obligation, the consideration is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices. Judgment is required to determine standalone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the actual prices charged to customers and has an established range of amounts that fall within stand-alone selling price for its distinct performance obligations. The Company evaluates this range quarterly. 

Financial Statement Impact of Adopting ASC 606 

The Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method. The cumulative effect of applying the new guidance to all contracts with customers that were not completed as of January 1, 2018 would require an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the adoption date. As a result of applying the modified retrospective method to adopt the new revenue guidance, the Company determined that there were no significant adjustments to be made to its consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2018. 

Costs to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract 

In addition to the new revenue recognition guidance, “Other Assets and Deferred Costs” (ASC 340-40), was added to provide guidance on the accounting for certain costs to obtain and fulfill contracts (or, in some cases, an anticipated contract) with a customer. ASC 340-40 is applicable only to incremental contract costs, those that an entity would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained, and requires the capitalization of such costs as well as provides guidance on the amortization and impairment considerations. The Company elects the practical expedient and expenses certain costs to obtain contracts when applicable. There were no material costs to obtain a contract in the six months ended June 30, 2018. 

Impact of New Revenue Guidance on Financial Statement Line Items 






Transaction Price Allocated to Future Performance Obligations 

In order to determine the allocation of the transaction price and amounts allocated to the performance obligations, the Company first determined the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligations in the contract in order to determine the allocations of the transaction price in proportion to the standalone selling price for each performance obligation in the contract in accordance with ASC 606-10-32-31 and 32-33. Judgment is required to determine standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the actual prices charged to customers and has an established range of amounts that fall within stand-alone selling price for its distinct performance obligations. The Company will evaluate this range quarterly. 

Practical Expedients and Exemptions 

The Company adopted various practical expedients and policy elections related to the accounting for significant finance components, sales taxes, shipping and handling, costs to obtain a contract and immaterial promised goods or services, which will mitigate certain impacts of adopting this new standard. The practical expedient to disclose the unfulfilled performance obligations was not made as they are expected to be fulfilled within one year. 


Disaggregation of revenue 

Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that best reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In accordance with ASC 606-10-50-5, the following tables present how we disaggregate our revenues, which is different for each segment. 










The Company does not currently analyze revenue for Net2Edge on a disaggregated basis. Revenues from Net2Edge were $681,000 and $180,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Revenues were $846,000 and $537,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Contract Balances 

The Company does not have material costs to obtain a contract or material contract liabilities. 

NOTE 3 – CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS 





The Company tests for other than temporary losses on a quarterly basis and has considered the unrealized losses indicated above to be temporary in nature. The Company intends to hold the investments until it can recover the full principal amount and has the ability to do so based on other sources of liquidity. The Company expects such recoveries to occur prior to the contractual maturities. All unrealized losses as of June 30, 2018 were in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and are not deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of June 30, 2018. 



The Company did not recognize any gross realized gains or losses during the three months ending June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. If the Company had realized gains or losses, they would be included within investment and other income in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive loss. 

NOTE 4 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

Under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), employees are able to acquire shares of common stock at 85% of the price at the end of each current quarterly plan term. The most recent term ended June 30, 2018. The ESPP is considered compensatory under current Internal Revenue Service rules. At June 30, 2018, after giving effect to the shares issued as of that date, 39,380 shares remain available for purchase under the ESPP. 


2011 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan 

On March 28, 2011 the Board adopted and on May 19, 2011 the Company’s shareholders approved the Company’s 2011 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (“2011 Incentive Plan”). The 2011 Incentive Plan authorizes incentive awards to officers, key employees and non-employee directors in the form of options (incentive and non-qualified), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units (“deferred stock”), performance cash units, and other awards in stock, cash, or a combination of stock and cash. The 2011 Incentive Plan, as amended, allows the issuance of up to 2,500,000 shares of common stock. 

During 2018, stock options covering 218,665 shares have been awarded to key executive employees and directors. These options expire seven years from the date of award and generally vest 25% each year beginning one year after the date of award. The Company also conditionally granted deferred stock awards of 163,002 shares to key employees during the first half of 2018 under the Company’s long-term incentive plan for performance over the 2018 to 2020 period. The actual number of shares of deferred stock, if any, that are ultimately earned by the respective employees will be determined based on achievement against performance goals at the end of the three-year period ending December 31, 2020 and any shares earned will be issued in the first quarter of 2021 to those key employees still with the Company at that time. 

At June 30, 2018, 208,555 shares have been issued under the 2011 Incentive Plan, 1,635,666 shares are subject to currently outstanding options, deferred stock awards, and unvested restricted stock units, and 655,779 shares are eligible for grant under future awards. 

Stock Option Plan for Directors 

Shares of common stock are reserved for issuance to non-employee directors under options granted by the Company prior to 2011 under its Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “Director Plan”). Under the Director Plan nonqualified stock options to acquire shares of common stock were automatically granted to each non-employee director concurrent with annual meetings of shareholders in 2010 and earlier years, with the exercise price of options granted being the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the respective shareholder meetings. Options granted under the Director Plan expire 10 years from date of grant. No options have been granted under the Director Plan since 2011 when the Company amended the Director Plan to prohibit future option grants. As of June 30, 2018, there were 36,000 shares subject to outstanding options under the Director Plan. 

Changes in Stock Options Outstanding 




The aggregate intrinsic value of all options (the amount by which the market price of the stock on the last day of the period exceeded the market price of the stock on the date of grant) outstanding at June 30, 2018 was $38,000. The intrinsic value of all options exercised during the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $0. Net cash proceeds from the exercise of all stock options were $0 in each of the six month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. 

Changes in Deferred Stock Outstanding 



Changes in Restricted Stock Units Outstanding 



Compensation Expense 

Share-based compensation expense recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $110,000 before income taxes and $87,000 after income taxes. Share-based compensation expense recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $246,000 before income taxes and $160,000 after income taxes. Unrecognized compensation expense for the Company’s plans was $237,000 at June 30, 2018 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years. Share-based compensation expense is recorded as a part of selling, general and administrative expenses. 

NOTE 5 - INVENTORIES 




NOTE 6 – GOOWDWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 


The Company performs its annual impairment analysis as of April 1 each year. The Company analyzed the reporting unit that had the goodwill and also analyzed the company as a whole, including the Company’s four separate reporting units. Although JDL Technologies had been profitable for the past eight quarters, the cyclicality and unpredictability of revenues from its education sector raised issues in forecasting cash flows in future quarters used to estimate the reporting unit’s fair value. Based on this analysis of comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the book value, and comparing the Company’s overall book value with its market capitalization, the Company determined that the book value exceeded the overall fair value of the reporting units as well as the Company’s overall market value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge totaling $1,463,000 during the second quarter of 2017. 

As part of the overall annual impairment analysis noted above, the Company also reviewed other intangible assets for potential impairment. Based on this analysis, the Company deemed the intangible assets related to customer relationships to be impaired and recorded a $154,000 impairment loss during the second quarter of 2017. 







NOTE 7 – WARRANTY 

We provide reserves for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. We estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our warranty policy or applicable contractual warranty, historical experience of known product failure rates, and use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures. Management reviews the estimated warranty liability on a quarterly basis to determine its adequacy. The actual warranty expense could differ from the estimates made by the Company based on product performance. The warranty liability is included in other accrued liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

The following table presents the changes in the Company’s warranty liability for the six month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, the majority of which relates to a five-year obligation to provide for potential future liabilities for network equipment sales. 



NOTE 8 – CONTINGENCIES 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to legal actions and claims and incurs costs to defend against these actions and claims. Company management is not aware of any outstanding or pending legal actions or claims that could materially affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 

NOTE 9 – DEBT 

Line of Credit 

The Company has a $15,000,000 line of credit from Wells Fargo Bank. The Company had no outstanding borrowings against the line of credit at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Due to the revolving nature of loans under our credit facility, additional borrowings and periodic repayments and re-borrowings may be made until the maturity date. The total amount available for borrowings under our credit facility at June 30, 2018 was $7,553,000, based on the borrowing base calculation. Interest on borrowings on the credit line is at LIBOR plus 2.0% (4.1% at June 30, 2018). The credit agreement expires August 12, 2021 and is secured by assets of the Company. Our credit agreement contains financial covenants including a minimum liquidity balance of $10,000,000. Liquidity is calculated as the sum of unrestricted cash, marketable securities and the availability on the line of credit. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants at June 30, 2018. 

NOTE 10 – INCOME TAXES 

In the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, management calculates income taxes based upon the estimated effective rate applicable to operating results for the full fiscal year. This includes estimating the current tax liability as well as assessing differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded on the balance sheet. Management analyzes these assets and liabilities regularly and assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. 

At June 30, 2018 there was $33,000 of net uncertain tax benefit positions that would reduce the effective income tax rate if recognized. The Company records interest and penalties related to income taxes as income tax expense in the condensed consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss. 

The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. The tax years 2014-2017 remain open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and the years 2013-2017 remain open to examination by various state tax departments. The tax years from 2014-2017 remain open in Costa Rica. 

The Company’s effective income tax rate was 0.1% for the first six months of 2018. The effective tax rate differs from the federal tax rate of 21% due to state income taxes, foreign tax rate differences, foreign losses not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, provisions for interest charges for uncertain income tax positions, stock compensation shortfalls and changes in valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets. The foreign operating losses may ultimately be deductible in the countries in which they occurred; however the Company has not recorded a deferred tax asset for these losses due to uncertainty regarding the eventual realization of the benefit. The effect of the foreign operations was an overall rate decrease of approximately (8.2%) for the six months ended June 30, 2018. There were no additional uncertain tax positions identified in the first six months of 2018. The Company’s effective income tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was (0.8%), and differed from the federal tax rate due to state income taxes, foreign tax rate differences, foreign losses not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, provisions for interest charges for uncertain income tax positions, stock compensation shortfalls and changes in valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets. 


NOTE 11 – SEGMENT INFORMATION 


 ●Suttle manufactures and markets connectivity infrastructure products for broadband and voice communications;  

 ●Transition Networks manufactures media converters, NIDs, NICs, Ethernet switches and other connectivity products that offer the ability to affordably integrate the benefits of fiber optics into any data network;  

 ●JDL Technologies provides technology solutions that address prevalent IT challenges, including virtualization and cloud solutions, managed services, wired and wireless network design and implementation, and converged infrastructure configuration and deployment; and  

 ●Net2Edge develops, manufactures and sells products that enable telecommunications carriers to connect legacy networks to high-speed services.  

Management has chosen to organize the enterprise and disclose reportable segments based on our products and services. Intersegment revenues are eliminated upon consolidation. 








NOTE 12 – NET LOSS PER SHARE 

Basic net income per common share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period and year. Diluted net income per common share takes into effect the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding. The Company’s only potential common shares outstanding are stock options and shares associated with the long-term incentive compensation plans, which resulted in no dilutive effect for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. The Company calculates the dilutive effect of outstanding options using the treasury stock method. Due to the net losses in the first three and six months of 2018 and 2017, there was no dilutive impact from stock options or unvested shares. Options totaling 1,150,107 and 1,178,607 were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 because the exercise price was greater than the average market price of common stock during the period and deferred stock awards totaling 309,819 shares would not have been included for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 because of unmet performance conditions. Options totaling 888,042 were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 because the exercise price was greater than the average market price of common stock during the period and deferred stock awards totaling 187,958 shares would not have been included for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 because of unmet performance conditions. 

NOTE 13 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 


Level 1 – Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2 – Observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar instruments and quoted prices in markets that are not active, and inputs that are directly observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts, such as treasury securities with pricing interpolated from recent trades of similar securities, or priced with models using highly observable inputs, such as commodity options priced using observable forward prices and volatilities. 

Level 3 – Significant inputs to pricing that have little or no observability as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation, such as the complex and subjective models and forecasts used to determine the fair value of financial instruments. 

As discussed in Note 6, we tested our goodwill for impairment as of April 1, 2017. As part of this impairment testing, the Company determined the fair value of the net assets of the JDL Technologies reporting unit, based primarily on discounted cash flows and forecasted future operating results, which represent Level 3 inputs. As a result of our analysis, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1,463,000 to fully impair goodwill. 





We record transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, if necessary, at the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between levels during the six months ended June 30, 2018. 

NOTE 14 – RESTRUCTURING 

During the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company recorded $1,530,000 in restructuring expense. This consisted of severance and related benefits costs due to the restructuring within the Suttle business segment, including ongoing costs related to the closure of the Costa Rica facility. The facility was completely closed during 2017. The Company had no restructuring expenses for the six month period ended June 30, 2018. 


NOTE 15 – RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The new guidance will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance. According to the new guidance, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. As a result of the FASB’s July 2015 deferral of the standard’s required implementation date, the guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted the accounting standard effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition approach. Please see Note 2 for the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this standard and a discussion of the Company’s updated policies related to revenue recognition and accounting for costs to obtain and fulfill a customer contract. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, which amends existing guidance and requires an entity to recognize both assets and liabilities arising from financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted. We have not yet determined the potential effects on our financial condition or results of operations. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topics 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows by providing guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018 with no material impact to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 

In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The amendments in this update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses. This ASU is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses and is effective for annual periods and interim periods for those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, which for us is the first quarter ending March 31, 2020. Entities may early adopt beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements. 


NOTE 16 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

On August 2, 2018, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with Launch Properties, LLC for the sale of the Company’s building located at 10900 Red Circle Drive, Minnetonka, MN for $10,000,000. The building currently includes the Company’s corporate administrative offices, as well as some operations for Transition Networks, Suttle and JDL Technologies. The closing of the transaction is subject to a number of closing conditions, including the buyer’s ability to complete due diligence within 180 days and the buyers ability to obtain regulatory approval for its intended of the property. If the sale proceeds, the Company currently expects the transaction to close within the second or third quarter of 2019.

This effective tax rate for 2018 differs from the federal tax rate of 21% due to state income taxes, foreign tax rate differences, foreign losses not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, provisions for interest charges for uncertain income tax positions, stock compensation shortfalls and changes in valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of June 30, 2018, the Company had approximately $14,172,000 in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Of this amount, $5,722,000 was invested in short-term money market funds that are not considered to be bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or other government agency. These money market funds seek to preserve the value of the investment at $1.00 per share; however, it is possible to lose money investing in these funds. The remainder in cash and cash equivalents is operating cash and certificates of deposit that are insured through the FDIC. The Company also had $6,106,000 in investments consisting of commercial paper and corporate notes and bonds that are traded on the open market and are classified as available-for-sale at June 30, 2018. 

The Company had working capital of $32,402,000 at June 30, 2018, consisting of current assets of approximately $42,917,000 and current liabilities of $10,515,000 compared to working capital of $36,506,000 at December 31, 2017 consisting of current assets of $45,466,000 and current liabilities of $8,960,000.

Cash dividends paid on common stock increased to $761,000 in 2018 ($0.08 per common share) from $738,000 in 2017 ($0.08 per common share). Proceeds from common stock issuances, principally shares sold to the Company’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan and issued under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, totaled approximately $53,000 in 2018 and $29,000 in 2017. The Company did not repurchase any shares in 2018 or 2017 under the Board-authorized program. At June 30, 2018, Board of Director authority to purchase approximately 411,910 additional shares remained in effect.

In the opinion of management, based on the Company’s current financial and operating position and projected future expenditures, sufficient funds are available to meet the Company’s anticipated operating and capital expenditure needs. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgments underlying them, are discussed in our 2017 Form 10-K in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which has been subsequently updated. The purpose of Update No. 2014-09 is to provide enhancements to the quality and consistency of how revenue is reported while also improving comparability in the financial statements of companies using U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The core principle requires entities to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration an entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 and its related amendments effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Please see Note 2 for the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this standard and a discussion of the Company’s updated policies related to revenue recognition and accounting for costs to obtain and fulfill a customer contract. There were no other significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2018. 

The Company’s accounting policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and disclose matters such as allowance for doubtful accounts, sales returns, inventory valuation, warranty expense, income taxes, revenue recognition, asset impairment recognition and foreign currency translation. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the result of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. Management reviews these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. 


Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Recently issued accounting standards and their estimated effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are also described in Note 15, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

The Company has no freestanding or embedded derivatives. The Company’s policy is to not use freestanding derivatives and to not enter into contracts with terms that cannot be designated as normal purchases or sales. 

The vast majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars; as such, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have historically not been material to the Company. At June 30, 2018 our bank line of credit carried a variable interest rate based on LIBOR plus 2.0%. As noted above, we had no outstanding borrowings at June 30, 2018. 

Based on the Company’s operations, in the opinion of management, no material future losses or exposure exist relative to market risk. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 


The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, as detailed below, management concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. 


Beginning January 1, 2018, we implemented ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Although the adoption of the new revenue standard had an immaterial impact on our ongoing net income, we implemented changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and the control activities within these processes. These included the development of new policies based on the five-step model provided in the new revenue standard, new training, ongoing contract review requirements, and gathering of information provided for disclosures. There was no other change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective for the item noted below. 


Long-lived Asset Impairment Testing. Based on management’s testing and evaluation, we determined that we did not design and maintain effective internal control over the step one goodwill impairment testing that we performed in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other and ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, as of April 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Specifically, the Company’s review control did not operate at a sufficient level of precision to identify the improper assumptions used in our impairment analyses. We concluded that this lack of review in sufficient detail of the analyses was a material weakness in our internal controls. We wrote off the JDL reporting unit goodwill in the second quarter of 2017 and at December 31, 2017, had no recorded goodwill. If we record goodwill in the future, however, we will need to implement and maintain internal controls to ensure we complete our goodwill impairment analysis in a timely manner and with adequate detail. 

In addition, we have performed additional procedures related to the Company’s long-lived asset impairment analysis and concluded that our failure to adequately review our impairment analysis in sufficient detail did not result in misstatements within the Company’s consolidated financial statements. We concluded, however, that there was a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in the Company’s consolidated financial statements may not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Remediation Plan in Response to Material Weakness 

To address the above, we are in the process of designing new review controls to value our business units to ensure that goodwill and long-lived asset impairment analyses are completed in a timely manner and in enough detail to operate at a sufficient level of precision to identify improper assumptions. 

 (a)Inherent Limitations on Control Systems 

Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, will be or have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
