 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements




The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and therefore do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP); however, such information reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.

The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, some of the Company’s statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q may involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected future results. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year.


The Company has reclassified the presentation of certain prior-year information to conform to the current presentation. The Company included finance lease receivables of $12.8 and $14.4 in other assets as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Recently Issued Accounting Guidance



Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. 

The Company's payment terms vary depending on the individual contracts and are generally fixed fee. The Company recognizes advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue. In certain contracts where services are provided prior to billing, the Company recognizes a contract asset within trade receivables and other current assets.

Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.

The Company recognizes shipping and handling fees billed when products are shipped or delivered to a customer and includes such amounts in net sales. Although infrequent, shipping and handling associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer is not a separate performance obligation, rather is accounted for as a fulfillment cost. Third-party freight payments are recorded in cost of sales.

The Company includes a warranty in connection with certain contracts with customers, which are not considered to be separate performance obligations. The Company provides its customers a manufacturer’s warranty and records, at the time of the sale, a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs. For additional information on product warranty refer to note 9. The Company also has extended warranty and service contracts available for its customers, which are recognized as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized on these contracts ratably as the Company has a stand-ready obligation to provide services when or as needed by the customer. This input method is the most accurate assessment of progress toward completion the Company can apply.

Nature of goods and services 

The following is a description of principal solutions offered within the Company's two main industry segments that generate the Company's revenue. For more detailed information about reportable operating segments, see note 20.

The Company provides its banking customers product-related services which include proactive monitoring and rapid resolution of incidents through remote service capabilities or an on-site visit. First and second line maintenance, preventive maintenance and on-demand services keep the distributed assets of the Company's customers up and running through a standardized incident management process. Managed services and outsourcing consists of the end-to-end business processes, solution management, upgrades and transaction processing. The Company also provides a full array of cash management services, which optimizes the availability and cost of physical currency across the enterprise through efficient forecasting, inventory and replenishment processes.

Banking and retail services may be sold separately or in bundled packages. The typical contract length for service is generally one year and is billed and paid in advance except for installations, among others. 

The Company's hardware-agnostic software applications facilitate millions of transactions via automated teller machines (ATMs), point of sale (POS) terminals, kiosks, and other self-service devices. The Company provides its banking customers front-end applications for consumer connection points and back-end platforms that manage channel transactions, operations and integration. For retail customers, the Company provides a comprehensive, modular solution capable of enabling the most advanced omnichannel retail use cases. The Company's platform software is installed within bank and retail data centers to facilitate omnichannel transactions, endpoint monitoring, remote asset management, customer marketing, merchandise management and analytics. These offerings include highly configurable, application program interface (API) enabled software that automates legacy banking transactions across channels.

The Company’s software solution includes its professional services team, who provides systems integration, customization, consulting and project management. The Company’s advisory services team collaborates with its customers to help define optimal user experience, improve business processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technology to meet branch and store automation objectives.

Software licenses and professional services may be sold separately or in bundled packages. Software licenses when bundled with professional services, where the service is modifying the intellectual property (IP), is non-distinct from the professional service. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between distinct obligations in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates stand-alone selling prices using the cost plus expected margin approach or in the case of the software license the residual approach may be used. The Company’s software licenses are functional in nature (the IP has significant stand-alone functionality); as such, the revenue recognition of distinct software license sales is at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the rights granted by the license. Revenue from professional services are recognized over time, because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance as the services are performed or when the Company’s performance creates an asset with no alternative use to the Company and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Generally revenue will be recognized using an input measure, typically costs incurred.

Products for banking customers consists of cash recyclers and dispensers, intelligent deposit terminals, teller automation tools and kiosk technologies, as well as physical security solutions. The retail product portfolio includes modular, integrated and mobile POS and self-checkout (SCO) terminals that meet evolving automation and omnichannel requirements of consumers. Supplementing the POS system is a broad range of peripherals, including printers, scales and mobile scanners, as well as the cash management portfolio which offers a wide range of banknote and coin processing systems. Also in the portfolio, the Company provides self-checkout terminals and ordering kiosks which facilitate an efficient and user-friendly purchasing experience. The Company’s hybrid product line can alternate from an attended operator to self-checkout with the press of a button as traffic conditions warrant throughout the business day.

For bundled packages, the Company accounts for individual services separately if they are distinct. A distinct service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate services or distinct obligations in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells the products or services. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates stand-alone selling prices using the cost plus expected margin approach. Revenue on service contracts is recognized ratably over time, generally using an input measure, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance as the services are performed. In some circumstances, when global service supply chain services are not included in a term contract and rather billed as they occur, revenue on these billed work services are recognized at a point in time as transfer

of control occurs. Product revenue is recognized at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the product, which could be upon delivery or upon completion of installation services, depending on contract terms.

Disaggregation of revenue

For additional information related to revenue disaggregation by reportable segment, refer to note 20.





Contract balances



Contract assets are minimal for the periods presented. The amount of revenue recognized in 2018 from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, mainly due to the changes in the estimate of variable consideration and contract modifications was de minimis. There have been $2.1 and $5.0 during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $10.9 and $14.8 during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of impairment losses recognized as bad debt related to receivables or contract assets arising from the Company's contracts with customers.

DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

FORM 10-Q as of June 30, 2018

 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)



As of January 1, 2018, the Company had $437.5 of unrecognized deferred revenue constituting the remaining performance obligations that are either unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied). In 2018, the Company recognized revenue of $179.7 related to the Company's deferred revenue balance at January 1, 2018.

Contract assets are the rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Contract assets of the Company primarily relate to the Company's rights to consideration for goods shipped and services provided but not contractually billable at the reporting date.

The contract assets are reclassified into the receivables balance when the rights to receive payment become unconditional. Contract liabilities are recorded for any services billed to customers and not yet recognizable if the contract period has commenced or for the amount collected from customers in advance of the contract period commencing. In addition, contract liabilities are recorded as advanced payments for products and other deliverables that are billed to and collected from customers prior to revenue being recognizable.

Transaction price and variable consideration

The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. This consideration can include fixed and variable amounts and is determined at contract inception and updated each reporting period for any changes in circumstances. The transaction price also considers variable consideration, time value of money and the measurement of any non-cash consideration, all of which are estimated at contract inception and updated at each reporting date for any changes in circumstances. 

The Company also applies the ‘as invoiced’ practical expedient in paragraph 606-10-55-18 related to performance obligations satisfied over time, which permits the Company to recognize revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice the customer if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date.

Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations

As of June 30, 2018, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $2,600. The Company expects to recognize revenue on the remaining performance obligations over the next twelve months. The Company enters into service agreements with cancellable terms after a certain period without penalty. Unsatisfied obligations reflect only the obligation during the initial term. The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. 

The Company also applies the ‘as invoiced’ practical expedient in paragraph 606-10-55-18 related to performance obligations satisfied over time which permits the Company to recognize revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice the customer if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date.

Cost to obtain and cost to fulfill a contract 

The Company has minimal cost to obtain or fulfill contracts for customers for the periods presented. The Company pays commissions to the sales force based on multiple factors including but not limited to order entry, revenue recognition and portfolio growth. These incremental commission fees paid to the sales force meet the criteria to be considered a cost to obtain a contract, as they are directly attributable to a contract, incremental and management expects the fees are recoverable. The Company applies the practical expedient and recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. The costs that are not capitalized are included in cost of sales. The costs related to contracts with greater than a one-year term are immaterial and continue to be recognized in cost of sales.

Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of sales. The Company has minimal cost for shipping and handling costs for the periods presented.

Changes in accounting policies

Except for the changes below, the Company has consistently applied the accounting policies to all periods presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements.

The Company adopted Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, with a date of initial application of January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed below. 

The Company applied Topic 606 using the cumulative effect method - i.e., by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying Topic 606 as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at January 1, 2018. Therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under Topic 605. The Company applied the practical expedient related to assessment of contract modifications, whereby the Company is essentially allowed to use hindsight when assessing the effect of a modification and accounting for the modified contract as if it existed from the beginning of the original contract. 

The details of the significant changes and quantitative impact of the changes are set out below.

Professional service contracts

Previously, the Company recognized revenue for professional services contracts either on a milestone method or completed contract basis. Under Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control transfers to a customer. As professional services can be highly customized for each customer, there is no alternative use for the services. When there is an enforceable right to payment for service completed combined with no alternative use of the services, the services meet criteria for over time revenue recognition. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided and as the customer benefits from the service. Revenue is recognized progressively based on the costs incurred method. When the professional services are not highly customized as in basic software installation services, customers do not take control of the services until they are completed. Therefore, the Company continues to recognize revenue for such contracts when the services are completed and customers formally accept them.

Impacts on financial statements

The following tables summarize the impacts of adopting Topic 606 on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended June 30, 2018 as if the Company continued to follow its accounting policies under the previous revenue recognition guidance.


The impact to net sales and cost of sales would have been decreases of $14.7 and $8.2, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and $13.8 and $8.6, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The impact after tax was $(4.6) and $(3.6) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and was primarily a result of timing of deferred revenue related to products and software for certain amounts being recognized that would have previously been deferred, and certain amounts being deferred that would have previously been recognized.

Basic earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding. Under the two-class method of computing earnings (loss) per share, non-vested share-based payment awards that contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends are considered participating securities. The Company’s participating securities include restricted stock units (RSUs), director deferred shares and shares that were vested but deferred by employees. The Company calculated basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share under both the treasury stock method and the two-class method. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, there were no differences in the earnings (loss) per share amounts calculated under the two methods. Accordingly, the treasury stock method is disclosed below.



In May 2018, the Company announced its decision to reallocate future dividend funds towards debt reduction and other capital resource needs.


The Company’s share-based compensation payments to employees are recognized based on their grant-date fair values during the period in which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. Share-based compensation is primarily recognized as a component of selling and administrative expense. Total share-based compensation expense was $6.6 and $8.2 for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and was $20.3 and $15.0 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Performance shares are granted to employees and vest based on the achievement of certain performance objectives, as determined by the board of directors each year. Each performance share earned entitles the holder to one common share of the Company. The Company's performance shares include performance objectives that are assessed after a three-year period as well as performance objectives that are assessed annually over a three-year period. No shares are vested unless certain performance threshold objectives are met.

As of June 30, 2018, there were 0.1 non-employee director deferred shares vested and outstanding.

On April 25, 2018, the Company's shareholders approved amendments to the 2017 Plan, which provide for an additional 1.2 common shares available for award. The 2017 Plan is expected to attract and retain directors, officers and employees of the Company by providing incentives and rewards for performance.

The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations was 18.2 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 4.9 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The benefit on the losses for these periods was decreased primarily due to nondeductible permanent discrete adjustment associated with the $90.0 of goodwill impairment charge and the impacts of the Tax Act, more specifically, impacts related to the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) on the estimated annual tax rate. The effective tax rate could vary in future periods based on the Company’s earnings before taxes and clarifications around the Tax Act.

The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations was 60.6 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 43.7 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The tax rate on the loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 was increased due to the jurisdictional income (loss) mix and varying statutory rates in the Company’s global footprint. These increases to the overall tax rate for these periods was offset in part by additional discrete expense items recognized in the quarter related to uncertain tax positions.




The increase in finished goods inventory was primarily attributable to increased inventory in Germany, India and Philippines to satisfy various customer projects and favorable buying opportunities. Raw materials and work in process inventory increased primarily due to a build up of inventory in the U.S. to satisfy a recent large retail customer and certain supply chain issues.


The Company’s investments, primarily in Brazil, consist of certificates of deposit that are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in AOCI. Realized gains and losses are recognized in investment income and are determined using the specific identification method. There were no realized gains from the sale of securities or proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

are not significant subsidiaries and are accounted for under the equity method of investments. As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had accounts receivable with these affiliates of $12.2 and $15.6, respectively, which are included in trade receivables, less allowances for doubtful accounts on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had accounts payable balances with these affiliates of $17.2 and $17.8, respectively, which are included in accounts payables on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

In May 2017, the Company announced a strategic partnership with Kony, a leading enterprise mobility and application company, to offer white label mobile application solutions for financial institutions and retailers. The Company acquired a minority equity stake in Kony, which is accounted for using the cost method of accounting. As of June 30, 2018, the Company's carrying value in Kony was $14.0 and the fair value was not estimated as there were no events or changes in circumstances in the investment. 

Securities and other investments also includes a cash surrender value of insurance contracts of $79.9 and $79.8 as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. In addition, it includes an interest rate swap asset carrying value of $9.5 and $7.6 as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which also represents fair value (refer to note 18).

The Company has finance lease receivables of $12.8 and $14.4 in other assets as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

There were no significant changes in provision for credit losses, recoveries and write-offs during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. As of June 30, 2018, finance leases and notes receivable individually evaluated for impairment were $25.1 and $10.6, respectively, with no provision recorded. As of June 30, 2017, finance leases and notes receivable individually evaluated for impairment were $43.2 and $20.8, respectively.

The Company records interest income and any fees or costs related to financing receivables using the effective interest method over the term of the lease or loan. The Company reviews the aging of its financing receivables to determine past due and delinquent accounts. Credit quality is reviewed at inception and is re-evaluated as needed based on customer-specific circumstances. Receivable balances 60 days to 89 days past due are reviewed and may be placed on nonaccrual status based on customer-specific circumstances. Receivable balances are placed on nonaccrual status upon reaching greater than 89 days past due. Upon receipt of payment on nonaccrual financing receivables, interest income is recognized and accrual of interest is resumed once the account has been made current or the specific circumstances have been resolved.

As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the recorded investment in past due financing receivables on nonaccrual status was $0.5 and $0.6, respectively, and there were no recorded investments in finance receivables past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. The recorded investment in impaired notes receivable was $4.1 as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and was fully reserved and as of June 30, 2018 are all greater than 89 days past due.

In 2018, the Company acquired the remaining portion of the noncontrolling interest in its China operations for $5.8 for which no goodwill was recorded. In 2017, the $5.6 acquired goodwill from Moxx Group B.V. (Moxx) and Visio Objekt GmbH (Visio) primarily relates to anticipated synergies achieved through increased scale and higher utilization of the service organization.

The Company has identified four reporting units, which are Eurasia Banking, Americas Banking, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Retail and Rest of World Retail. Management determined that the Eurasia Banking, Rest of World Retail and EMEA Retail reporting units had excess fair value of $64.2 or 5.2 percent, $20.5 or 18.8 percent and $134.6 or 21.4 percent, respectively, when compared to their carrying amounts. The Americas Banking reporting unit had excess fair value of greater than 80 percent cushion when compared to its carrying amount. Changes in certain assumptions or the Company's failure to execute on the current plan could have a significant impact to the estimated fair value of the reporting units.

During the second quarter of 2018, the Company performed an impairment test of goodwill for all of its line of businesses (LoB) reporting units due to the change in its reportable operating segments. The Company estimated the fair value of its nine LoB reporting unit using a combination of the income valuation and market approach in valuation methodology. The determination of the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions, including significant unobservable inputs. The determination of the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions, including significant unobservable inputs. The key inputs included, but were not limited to, discount rates, terminal growth rates, market multiple data from selected guideline public companies, management’s internal forecasts which include numerous assumptions such as projected net sales, gross profit, sales mix, operating and capital expenditures and earnings before interest and taxes margins, among others. Based on the results of the LoB testing, the fair values of each of the Company's reporting units exceed their carrying values except for the Services-Asia Pacific (AP) and Software-EMEA reporting units. Therefore, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $90.0 during the second quarter of 2018. In 2017, the Company recorded impairments totaling $3.1 related to information technology (IT) transformation and integration activities.

Amortization expense on capitalized software of $8.0 and $9.7 was included in service and software cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Amortization expense on capitalized software of $16.8 and $19.3 was included in service and software cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's total amortization expense, including deferred financing costs, was $36.7 and $39.5 the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The Company provides its global operations guarantees and standby letters of credit through various financial institutions for suppliers, customers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers. If the Company is not able to make payments or fulfill contractual obligations, the suppliers, customers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers may draw on the pertinent bank. At June 30, 2018, the maximum future payment obligations related to these various guarantees totaled $168.5, of which $28.0 represented standby letters of credit to insurance providers, and no associated liability was recorded. At December 31, 2017, the maximum future payment obligations relative to these various guarantees totaled $195.1, of which $28.0 represented standby letters of credit to insurance providers, and no associated liability was recorded.

The Company provides its customers a manufacturer’s warranty and records, at the time of the sale, a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs. Estimated future obligations due to warranty claims are based upon historical factors such as labor rates, average repair time, travel time, number of service calls per machine and cost of replacement parts. The decrease in the liability was primarily due to warranties expiring in Brazil.

DN Now

During the second quarter of 2018, The Company began implementing DN Now to deliver greater, more sustainable profitability. The plan is anticipating savings of approximately $100 from the new customer centric operating model with clear role charters and a global workforce aligned with market demand. Additional near term activities include divesting of non-core businesses, improving service delivery and investing in solutions. The Company anticipates additional restructuring costs of approximately $130 to $150 through the end of the plan primarily related to severance anticipated for completion of the Company's transformation throughout the three solution segments and corporate.


During 2016, the Company launched a multi-year integration and transformation program, known as DN2020. The DN2020 plan focused on the utilization of cost efficiencies and synergy opportunities that result from the transformational acquisition of Wincor Nixdorf AG (Diebold Nixdorf AG), which aligned employee activities with the Company's goal of delivering cost reductions of approximately $240 by the year 2020. The Company incurred restructuring charges of $2.2 and $14.4 for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $6.0 and $27.3 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to DN2020. As of June 30, 2018, the Company has suspended this plan and does not anticipate additional DN2020 restructuring costs.

Delta Program

At the beginning of the 2015, Diebold Nixdorf AG initiated the Delta Program related to restructuring and realignment. As part of a change process that has spanned several years, the Delta Program is designed to hasten the expansion of software and professional services operations and to further enhance profitability in the services business.

Strategic Alliance Plan

During 2016, the Company entered into a strategic alliance plan with the Inspur Group, a Chinese cloud computing and data center company, to develop, manufacture and distribute banking solutions in China. The Company incurred $0.1 restructuring charges during the six months ended June 30, 2018 related to this plan. There were no charges during 2017. The Company anticipates minimal additional restructuring costs to be incurred through the end of the plan.








As of June 30, 2018, the Company had various international short-term uncommitted lines of credit with borrowing limits of $198.3. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings on the short-term uncommitted lines of credit as of June 30,

2018 and December 31, 2017 was 8.25 percent and 9.17 percent, respectively, and primarily relate to short-term uncommitted lines of credit in India. Short-term uncommitted lines mature in less than one year. The amount available under the short-term uncommitted lines at June 30, 2018 was $188.7.



The Company has a revolving and term loan credit agreement (the Credit Agreement), with a revolving facility of up to $520.0 (the Revolving Facility) and a secured term loan A facility (the Term Loan A Facility) in the amount of up to $230.0. On December 23, 2020, the Term Loan A Facility will mature and the Revolving Facility will automatically terminate. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding Revolving Facility borrowings as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was 4.13 percent and 3.63 percent, respectively, which is variable based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The amount available under the Revolving Facility as of June 30, 2018 was $380.0.

The Company has $400.0 aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes), which are and will be guaranteed by certain of the Company’s existing and future domestic subsidiaries and mature in April 2024.

On May 9, 2017, the Company entered into an incremental amendment to its Credit Agreement (the Incremental Agreement) which reduced the initial term loan B facility (the Term Loan B Facility) of a $1,000.0 U.S. dollar-denominated tranche to $475.0. The reduction was funded using the $250.0 proceeds drawn from the Delayed Draw Term Loan A Facility, a replacement of $70.0 with Term Loan B Facility - Euro and previous principal payments.

The interest rate with respect to the Term Loan B Facility - USD is based on, at the Company’s option, adjusted LIBOR plus 2.75 percent (with a floor of 0.00 percent) or Alternate Base Rate (ABR) plus 1.75 percent (with an ABR floor of 1.00 percent) and the interest rate with respect to the Term Loan B Facility - Euro is based on adjusted Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) plus 3.00 percent (with a floor of 0.00 percent).

The debt facilities under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries that are borrowers or guarantors under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens.

The Company's financing agreements contain various financial covenants, including net debt to capitalization, net debt to EBITDA and net interest coverage ratio. As of June 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial and other covenants in its debt agreements. However, the Company’s current operating performance has been below expectations that existed at the time that the financial covenant levels were established, and if financial performance does not improve, we anticipate noncompliance with the net debt to EBITDA financial covenant at the end of the third quarter of 2018. The Company is in process of seeking an amendment to that covenant or obtaining a waiver thereof from our lenders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining an amendment or waiver on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

noncontrolling interest during the first quarter of 2017. For the period of time that the DPLTA is effective, the noncontrolling interest related to the Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary shares the Company did not acquire will remain in redeemable noncontrolling interest and presented outside of equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets of the Company. As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the balance related to the redeemable noncontrolling interest related to the Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary shares the Company did not acquire was $439.2 and $454.6, respectively. The change in the balance is related to the euro weakening.

The DPLTA offers the Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders, at their election, (i) the ability to put their Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary shares to Diebold KGaA in exchange for cash compensation of €55.02 per Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary share or (ii) to remain Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders and receive a recurring compensation in cash of €2.82 per Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary share for each full fiscal year of Diebold Nixdorf AG. The redemption value adjustment includes the updated cash compensation pursuant to the DPLTA. In early August 2018, Diebold Nixdorf AG shareholders have requested redemption of approximately 2.4 shares with a value of $160. The Company expects to utilize cash on hand and borrowings under its Revolving Facility to fund the obligations. The ultimate timing and amount of any future cash payments related to the DPLTA are uncertain.

The remaining balance relates to certain noncontrolling interests with redemption features, that include put rights that are not within the control of the issuer, which are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. The redeemable noncontrolling interests were recorded at fair value as by applying the income approach using unobservable inputs for projected cash flows, including but not limited, to net sales and operating profit, and a discount rate, which are considered Level 3 inputs. The results of operations for these redeemable noncontrolling interests were not significant. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the put rights are uncertain.

During 2017, the Company acquired all the capital stock of Moxx and certain assets and liabilities of Visio for $5.6 in the aggregate, net of cash acquired, which are included in the Retail and Eurasia Banking segments, respectively. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company acquired Moxx, which is a Netherlands based managed services company that provides managed mobility solutions for enterprises that use a large number of mobile assets in their business operations. In the second quarter of 2017, the Company acquired Visio, which is a design company based in Germany.

During 2017, the Company divested its legacy Diebold business in the U.K. to Cennox Group for $5.0, fulfilling the requirements previously set forth by the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The divestiture closed on June 30, 2017. As part of the Company's routine efforts to evaluate its business operations, during 2017, the Company divested its electronic security (ES) businesses located in Mexico and Chile in the second and third quarters of 2017, respectively. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.2 related to these transactions. The combined net sales of the divestitures represented less than one percent of total net sales of the Company for 2017.


The Company has qualified retirement plans covering certain U.S. employees that have been closed to new participants since 2003 and frozen since December 2013. Plans that cover salaried employees provide retirement benefits based on an employee’s compensation during the ten years before the date of the plan freeze or the date of the employee's actual separation from service, if earlier. The Company’s funding policy for salaried plans is to contribute annually based on actuarial projections and applicable regulations. Plans covering hourly employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service. The Company’s funding policy for hourly plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by applicable regulations.

The Company has non-qualified pension plans to provide supplemental retirement benefits to certain officers, which were also frozen since December 2013. Benefits are payable at retirement based upon a percentage of the participant’s compensation, as defined. In addition to providing retirement benefits, the Company provides post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits (referred to as other benefits) for certain retired employees. Retired eligible employees in the U.S. may be entitled to these benefits based upon years of service with the Company, age at retirement and collective bargaining agreements. There are no plan assets and the Company funds the benefits as the claims are paid. The post-retirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and life insurance plans together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates.

The Company also has defined benefit plans in Germany and Switzerland, among others. In Germany, post-employment benefit plans are set up as employer funded pension plans and deferred compensation plans. The employer funded pension commitments in Germany are based upon direct performance-related commitments in terms of defined contribution plans. Each beneficiary receives, depending on individual pay-scale grouping, contractual classification or income level, different yearly contributions. The contribution is multiplied by an age factor appropriate to the respective pension plan and credited to the individual retirement account of the employee. The retirement accounts may be used up at retirement by either a one-time lump-sum payout or payments of up to ten years. Insured events include disability, death and reaching of retirement age. In Switzerland, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The employees receive their pension payments as a function of contributions paid, a fixed interest rate and annuity factors. Insured events are disability, death and reaching of retirement age.

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business or financing activities. The Company’s derivative foreign currency instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and cash payments principally related to the Company’s non functional currency assets and liabilities. The Company's interest rate derivatives are used to manage the differences in amount due to variable rate interest rate borrowings.

Foreign Exchange

Net Investment Hedges The Company has international subsidiaries with net balance sheet positions that generate cumulative translation adjustments within AOCI. The Company uses derivatives to manage potential changes in value of its net investments. The Company uses the forward-to-forward method for its quarterly measurement of ineffectiveness assessments of hedge effectiveness. No ineffectiveness results if the notional amount of the derivative matches the portion of the net investment designated as being hedged because the Company uses derivative instruments with underlying exchange rates consistent with its functional currency and the functional currency of the hedged net investment. Changes in value that are deemed effective are accumulated in AOCI where they will remain until they are reclassified to income together with the gain or loss on the entire investment upon substantial liquidation of the subsidiary. The fair value of the Company’s net investment hedge contracts was $11.8 and $2.0 as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The net loss recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge derivative instruments was $11.8 and $1.5 in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The net loss recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge derivative instruments was $10.9 and $1.4 in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

On August 15, 2016, the Company designated its €350.0 euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility as a net investment hedge of its investments in certain subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency in order to reduce volatility in stockholders' equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the euro with respect to the U.S. dollar. Effectiveness is assessed at least quarterly by confirming that the respective designated net investments' net equity balances at the beginning of any period collectively continues to equal or exceed the balance outstanding on the Company's euro-denominated term loan. Changes in value that are deemed effective are accumulated in AOCI. When the respective net investments are sold or substantially liquidated, the balance of the cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI will be reclassified into earnings. The net gain (loss) recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge foreign currency borrowings was $11.2 and$(19.6) for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The net gain (loss) recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge foreign currency borrowings was $5.4 and $(25.8) for the six months June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. On March 30, 2017, the Company de-designated €130.6 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility and on May 9, 2017, the Company designated an additional €66.8 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility as a result of its repricing described under note 11. On September 21, 2017, the Company de-designated €100.0 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility. On June 21, 2018, the Company re-designated €30.2 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility. 


Cash Flow Hedges The Company is exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies against its functional currency. At the Company, both sales and purchases are transacted in foreign currencies. The Company has certain subsidiaries with the euro (EUR) as its functional currency that are primarily exposed to the U.S. dollar (USD) and Great Britain pound sterling (GBP). This risk is considerably reduced by natural hedging (i.e., management of sales and purchases by choice location and suppliers). For the remainder of the risk that is not naturally hedged, foreign currency forwards are used to manage the exposure between EUR-GBP and EUR-USD.

 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)




Interest Rate

Cash Flow Hedges The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The Company has multiple pay-fixed receive-variable interest rate swaps outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $400.0.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. The fair value of the Company's interest rate contracts was $14.2 and $9.8 as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. The Company estimates that a minimal amount will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense over the next year.

The Company has an interest rate swap for a nominal sum of €50.0, which was entered into in May 2010 with a ten-year term from October 1, 2010 until September 30, 2020. This interest rate swap mitigated the interest rate risk associated with the European Investment Bank debt, which was paid in full during 2017. For this interest rate swap, the three-month EURIBOR is received and a fixed interest of 2.97 percent is paid. The fair value, which is measured at market prices, as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $(5.4) and $(5.5), respectively. The interest rate contract is not designated and changes in the fair value of non-designated interest rate swap agreements are recognized in miscellaneous, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized $0.4 and $0.9 in interest expense relating to the interest rate swap for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.

Additionally, the Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any additional derivatives that are not designated as hedges.

Contractual Obligation

At June 30, 2018, the Company had purchase commitments due within one year totaling $3.4 for materials and services through contract manufacturing agreements at negotiated prices. The Company guarantees a fixed cost of certain products used in production to its China strategic partners.

Indirect Tax Contingencies

The Company accrues non-income-tax liabilities for indirect tax matters when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. In the event any losses are sustained in excess of accruals, they are charged against income. In evaluating indirect tax matters, management takes into consideration factors such as historical experience with matters of similar nature, specific facts and circumstances, and the likelihood of prevailing. Management evaluates and updates accruals as matters progress over time. It is reasonably possible that some of the matters for which accruals have not been established could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require recognizing future expenditures. Also, statutes of limitations could expire without the Company paying the taxes for matters for which accruals have been established, which could result in the recognition of future gains upon reversal of these accruals at that time. 



In August 2012, one of the Company's Brazil subsidiaries was notified of a tax assessment of approximately R$270.0, including penalties and interest, regarding certain Brazil federal indirect taxes (Industrialized Products Tax, Import Tax, Programa de Integração Social and Contribution to Social Security Financing) for 2008 and 2009. The assessment alleges improper importation of certain components into Brazil's free trade zone that would nullify certain indirect tax incentives. On September 10, 2012, the Company filed its administrative defenses with the tax authorities.

In March 2017, the administrative proceedings concluded and the assessment was reduced approximately 95 percent to a total of R$17.3 including penalties and interest as of March 2017. The Company is pursuing its remedies in the judicial sphere and management continues to believe that it has valid legal positions. In addition, this matter could negatively impact Brazil federal indirect taxes in other years that remain open under statute. It is reasonably possible that the Company could be required to pay taxes, penalties and interest related to this matter, which could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had accrual related to the Brazil indirect tax matter of $4.2 and $4.9, respectively.

The Company has challenged the customs rulings in Thailand seeking to retroactively collect customs duties on previous imports of ATMs. Management believes that the customs authority’s attempt to retroactively assess customs duties is in contravention of World Trade Organization agreements and, accordingly, challenged the rulings. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company received a prospective ruling from the U.S. Customs Border Protection which is consistent with the Company's interpretation of the treaty in question. In August 2017, the Supreme Court of Thailand ruled in the Company's favor, finding that Customs' attempt to collect duties for importation of ATMs is improper. In addition, in August 2016 and February 2017, the tax court of appeals rendered decisions in favor of the Company related to more than half of the assessments at issue. The surviving matters remain at various stages of the appeals process and the Company will use the Supreme Court's decision in support of its position in those matters. Management remains confident that the Company has a valid legal position in these appeals. Accordingly, the Company does not have any amount accrued for this contingency.

A loss contingency is reasonably possible if it has a more than remote but less than probable chance of occurring. Although management believes the Company has valid defenses with respect to its indirect tax positions, it is reasonably possible that a loss could occur in excess of the estimated accrual. The Company estimated the aggregate risk at June 30, 2018 to be up to $128.1 for its material indirect tax matters, of which $22.0 and $27.0, respectively, primarily relates to the Brazil indirect tax matter and

Thailand customs matter disclosed above. The aggregate risk related to indirect taxes is adjusted as the applicable statutes of limitations expire.

Legal Contingencies

At June 30, 2018, the Company was a party to several lawsuits that were incurred in the normal course of business, which neither individually nor in the aggregate are considered material by management in relation to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. In management’s opinion, the Company's consolidated financial statements would not be materially affected by the outcome of these legal proceedings, commitments or asserted claims.


Diebold KGaA is a party to appraisal proceedings (Spruchverfahren) relating to the DPLTA entered into by Diebold KGaA and Diebold Nixdorf AG on September 26, 2016 pending at the District Court (Landgericht) of Dortmund (Germany). The appraisal proceedings were filed by minority shareholders of Diebold Nixdorf AG challenging the adequacy of both, the cash exit compensation of €55.02 per Diebold Nixdorf AG share and the annual recurring compensation of €2.82 per Diebold Nixdorf AG share offered in connection with the DPLTA. A ruling by the court would apply to all Diebold Nixdorf AG shares outstanding at the time the DPLTA became effective. While the Company believes that the compensation offered in connection with the DPLTA was fair and the claims lack merit, this matter is still at a preliminary stage and the outcome is uncertain. As a result, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from this litigation.


The Company's accounting policies derive segment results that are the same as those the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) regularly reviews and uses to make decisions, allocate resources and assess performance. The Company continually considers its operating structure and the information subject to regular review by its Chief Executive Officer, who is the CODM, to identify reportable operating segments. The Company’s operating structure is based on a number of factors that management uses to evaluate, view and run its business operations, which currently includes, but is not limited to, product, service and solution.



For additional information related to the Company's revenue sources, refer to note 2. In addition to the considerations mentioned above regarding the CODM, the Company has assessed several factors in disaggregating revenue which include the information disclosed in this report and other disaggregated revenue information provided in investor presentations and board of director presentations.

From a software perspective, the Company provides financial institutions with front-end applications for consumer connection points as well as back-end platforms that manage channel transactions, operations and integration. These hardware-agnostic software applications facilitate millions of transactions via ATMs, kiosks, and other self-service devices. The Company's platform software is installed within bank data centers to facilitate omnichannel transactions, endpoint monitoring, remote asset management, customer marketing, merchandise management and analytics. 

In 2017, the Company introduced Vynamic, the first end-to-end Connected Commerce software portfolio in the banking marketplace. The Vynamic suite's open API architecture is built to eliminate the traditional focus on internal silos and enable tomorrow's inter-connected partnerships between financial institutions and payment providers.

Gross Profit



Services and software gross margin was relatively flat in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 1.0% lower in the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods of the prior year. Both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were favorably impacted by lower restructuring charges of $12.9 and $13.9 and lower non-routine charges of $15.7 and $16.2, respectively, primarily related to lower purchase accounting adjustments inclusive of amortization and prior-year quarter deferred revenue. Excluding restructuring and non-routine charges, services and software gross margin decreased in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 by 4.0 and 3.0 percent, respectively, as a function of higher non-recurring services and software cost in Brazil banking as well as an unfavorable customer and solutions mix negatively impacting software margin in Eurasia. 

Product gross margin in the three months ended June 30, 2018 decreased 3.1 percent and increased 0.3 percent in the six months ended June 30, 2018. Both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were favorably impacted by lower restructuring charges of $1.4 and $1.5, respectively, and the six months ended were favorably impacted by lower non-routine charges of $19.5, primarily related to $14.0 lower Purchase Accounting Adjustments inclusive of amortization and prior-year deferred revenue, and a $3.7 benefit from the Brazil indirect tax accrual reversal in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding restructuring and non-routine charges, product gross margin decreased 3.2 and 1.9 percent in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, primarily in the Americas as a result of an unfavorable customer mix, unfavorable banking product mix, supply chain delays and corresponding expedited freight costs.

Operating Expenses




Selling and administrative expense in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 decreased $17.0 and $36.1, respectively. Excluding lower non-routine charges of $3.7 and higher restructuring of $0.6, the decrease in the three months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily attributable to lower corporate IT and associate related expense as well as cost reduction initiatives across the Company, specifically in the Americas and Eurasia banking segments. Excluding lower non-routine and restructuring charges of $14.3 and $6.5, respectively, the six months ended June 30, 2018 was favorable $15.3 due primarily to lower IT and associate

related expense as well as cost reduction initiatives in the Banking Eurasia and Americas segments. This decrease was partially offset by the Retail segment, primarily from increased investment in the new North America retail sales organization. Additionally, both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were favorably impacted $3.9 and $5.0, respectively, from the mark-to-market adjustment of the legacy Wincor Nixdorf stock option program. The decrease in selling and administrative expense was partially offset by an unfavorable currency impact of $7.3 and $28.5 in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.

Non-routine cost in selling and administrative expense of $36.1 and $39.8 were included in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The primary components of the non-routine expenses in the second quarter of 2018 pertained to purchase accounting adjustments of $22.3 related to intangible asset amortization and integration cost totaling $13.3. Selling and administrative expense included restructuring charges of $3.1 and $2.5 in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Non-routine costs in selling and administrative expense of $74.6 and $88.9 were included in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The primary components of the non-routine expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2018 pertained to purchase accounting adjustments of $46.1 related to intangible asset amortization and integration cost totaling $27.5. Selling and administrative expense included restructuring charges of $4.4 and $10.9 in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Research, development and engineering expense in the three months ended June 30, 2018 was flat including an unfavorable currency impact of $1.8. In the six months ended June 30, 2018, research, development and engineering expense included an unfavorable currency impact of $5.8. Excluding the impact of currency, research, development and engineering expense in the six months ended June 30, 2018 decreased primarily from higher capitalization of internally developed software. 

The impairment increased $86.9 to $90.0 during the six months ended June 30, 2018 from $3.1 during the same period in 2017 primarily due to the impairment of goodwill in the second quarter of 2018.

In the three months ended June 30, 2018, the loss on sale of assets was primarily related to a settlement of certain open matters related to an Americas divestiture, partially offset by gains related to the sale of a certain China investment and a building in North America. The gain on sale of assets in the six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily related to a gain on sale of buildings in North America of $4.8, the liquidation of the Barbados operating entity of $3.3 and gain related to a certain China investment. This gain on sale of assets was partially offset by the loss pertaining to a settlement of certain open matters related to an Americas divestiture in the second quarter of 2018.

Operating expense as a percent of net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2018 remained flat at 23.6 percent. In the six months ended June 30, 2018, operating expense as a percent of net sales was 24.1 percent compared with 25.0 in the same period of 2017 primarily related to lower restructuring and non-routine expense.

Operating Profit



The operating loss increased in the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due primarily to goodwill impairment, lower gross profit associated with decreased product volume and lower gross margins in services and software, partially offset by lower other non-routine and restructuring charges and favorable operating expense due to cost saving initiatives across the Company. The operating loss increased in the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due primarily due to goodwill impairment partially offset by lower other non-routine and restructuring charges as well as favorable operating expense attributable to cost saving initiatives.

Other Income (Expense)



Interest income in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 decreased, compared with the same periods in 2017, primarily as a result of lower average balances and reduced current period rates of short-term investments in Brazil. Interest expense in both the three and six months was lower compared to the same prior-year periods due to the favorable impact of refinancing the debt related to the Diebold Nixdorf AG acquisition and lower fee amortization. Foreign exchange loss, decreased in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same prior-year periods, primarily attributable to managing foreign exchange exposure, partially offset by the devaluation of the Argentina peso. 

Net Income (Loss)



The loss before taxes and net loss increased primarily due to the reasons described above. Net loss was also impacted by the change in the income tax benefit.

The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations was 18.2 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 4.9 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The benefit on the losses for these periods was decreased primarily due to nondeductible permanent discrete adjustment associated with the $90.0 of goodwill impairment charge and the impacts of the Tax Act, more specifically, impacts related to GILTI on the estimated annual tax rate. The effective tax rate could vary in future periods based on the Company’s earnings before taxes and clarifications around the Tax Act.

The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations was 60.6 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 43.7 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The tax rate on the loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 was increased due to the jurisdictional income (loss) mix and varying statutory rates in the Company’s global footprint. These increases to the overall tax rate for these periods were offset in part by additional discrete expense items recognized in the quarter related to uncertain tax positions.

Segment Net Sales and Operating Profit Summary



Eurasia Banking net sales decreased $36.0 and $38.9 in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, including a net favorable currency impact of $21.3 in the three months June 30, 2018 and $73.2 in the six months ended June 30, 2018, mainly related to the euro. In addition, prior year net sales in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 were adversely impacted $6.2 and $12.4, respectively, related to Deferred Revenue Adjustments. Excluding currency and deferred revenue adjustments, net sales in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 decreased $63.5 and $124.5, respectively, due to lower product volume in various countries throughout the segment related to fewer product deployments and projects, particularly in Indonesia, southern Europe and Australia, in addition to decreased services in India as a result of a lower maintenance contract base.

Segment operating profit decreased $12.2 and $14.4 in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the prior-year same periods. Both the three and six month ended June 30, 2018, decreased primarily as a result of lower gross profit due to lower product volume combined with increased manufacturing cost and an unfavorable software customer mix. Lower gross profit was partially offset by favorable operating expense from cost reduction initiatives.

Segment operating profit margin decreased in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the prior-year same periods due to unfavorable software customer mix partially offset by lower operating expense related to cost reduction initiatives.


Americas Banking net sales were flat in the three months ended June 30, 2018, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $5.5 related to the Brazil real. Excluding currency, net sales increased $5.7 from higher national account volume in North America and increased product related project activity in Latin America, specifically in Mexico and Ecuador. These increases were partially offset by product volume declines in Brazil and North America regional accounts. In the six months ended June 30, 2018, net sales decreased $47.7 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $5.7 related to the Brazil real. Excluding currency, net sales decreased $42.0 due to lower product volume in Brazil and the North America regional business which was adversely impacted by supply chain delays in the first quarter of 2018. These declines were partially offset by additional product volume in Mexico and Ecuador.

Segment operating profit decreased $10.2 and $27.9 in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the prior-year same periods. Both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were adversely impacted by lower installation activity associated with decreased product volume and higher non-recurring services and software cost in Brazil. Additionally, supply chain delays and corresponding expedited freight costs unfavorably impacted North America. These decreases were partially offset by increased software license and professional services volume throughout the region and operating cost reduction initiatives in Brazil.

Segment operating profit margin decreased in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the prior-year same periods due to higher cost resulting from non-recurring cost in Brazil and increased freight expense partially offset by lower operating expense associated with cost reduction initiatives primarily in Brazil.


Retail net sales increased $7.5 and $19.7 in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, including a net favorable currency impact of $16.6 in the three months and $53.5 in the six months ended June 30, 2018, mainly related to the euro. In addition, net sales were adversely impacted $4.1 and $8.3 in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, related to Deferred Revenue Adjustments. Excluding currency and Deferred Revenue Adjustments, net sales decreased $13.2 and $42.1, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, due to lower point of sale and kiosk volume, particularly in Germany. These declines were partially offset by higher volume in France, Benelux and Central Eastern Europe and a large retail kiosk project in North America.

Segment operating profit decreased $20.1 and $26.7 in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the prior-year same periods. The decrease in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was due primarily to lower gross profit in Eurasia as well as the Americas attributable to lower product volume and an unfavorable customer and solutions mix negatively impacting service and software margin. Additionally, in the six months ended June 30, 2018, operating profit was unfavorably impacted by increased operating expense in Eurasia related to increased research, development and engineering cost and higher Americas selling and administrative expense from developing the North America retail sales organization. Both periods in 2018 were impacted by under performance of non-core retail businesses.

Segment operating profit margin decreased in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the prior-year same periods due to unfavorable customer and solutions mix. In addition, the six months ended June 30, 2018 included higher operating expense related to the development of the retail business which negatively affected operating profit margin.

Liquidity and Capital Resources



Capital resources are obtained from income retained in the business, borrowings under the Company’s committed and uncommitted credit facilities and operating and capital leasing arrangements. Management expects that the Company’s capital resources will be sufficient to finance planned working capital needs, research and development activities, investments in facilities or equipment, pension contributions, the payment of dividends and any repurchases of the Company’s common shares for at least the next 12 months. As of June 30, 2018, $313.5 or 96.1 percent of the Company's cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments reside in international tax jurisdictions. Repatriation of certain international funds could be negatively impacted by potential payments for foreign taxes. The Company has approximately $1,400 of earnings that are available for repatriation with no additional tax expense. The Company has made acquisitions in the past and may make acquisitions in the future. Part of the Company’s strategy is to optimize the business portfolio through divestitures and complementary acquisitions. The Company intends to finance

Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring and integration activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.

Net cash used by operating activities was $256.6 for the six months ended June 30, 2018, an increase in use of $70.8 from $185.8 for the same period in 2017.



The most significant changes in adjustments to net income includes increased depreciation and amortization expense and additional share-based compensation. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $14.1 to $130.7 during the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $116.6 during the same period in 2017 primarily due to incremental intangible assets amortization expense related to the finalization of purchase accounting. Share-based compensation increased $5.3 to $20.3 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to a change in non-substantive vesting terms of certain awards and an increased number of non-vested awards granted. The impairment increased $86.9 to $90.0 during the six months ended June 30, 2018 from $3.1 during the same period in 2017 primarily due to the impairment of goodwill.

Investing Activities

The maturities and purchases of investments primarily relate to short-term investment activity in Brazil. The $93.9 change was primarily due to the utilization of short-term investments in Brazil for cash needs across the organization.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.0 and $36.0 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $35.0. The change was primarily due to an additional $31.1 in debt repayments, net of borrowings primarily related to payment of the Revolving Facility and higher cash distributions to noncontrolling interests of $29.1 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $12.8 in the prior-year period primarily related to cash compensation due to Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders. Refer to note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for details of the Company's cash flows related to debt borrowings and repayments.

Debt As of June 30, 2018, the Company had various international short-term uncommitted lines of credit with borrowing limits of $198.3. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings on the short-term uncommitted lines of credit as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was 8.25 percent and 9.17 percent, respectively. Short-term uncommitted lines mature in less than one year. The amount available under the short-term uncommitted lines at June 30, 2018 was $188.7.

The Credit Agreement includes the Revolving Facility in the amount of up to $520.0 and the Term Loan A Facility in the amount of up to $230.0. On December 23, 2020, the Term Loan A Facility will mature and the Revolving Facility will automatically terminate. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding Revolving Facility borrowings as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was 4.13 percent and 3.63 percent, respectively, which is variable based on the LIBOR. The amount available under the Revolving Facility as of June 30, 2018 was $380.0.

The Company has $400.0 aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Notes which are and will be guaranteed by certain of the Company’s existing and future domestic subsidiaries and mature in 2024.

On May 9, 2017, the Company entered into the Incremental Agreement which reduced the initial Term Loan B Facility of a $1,000.0 U.S. dollar-denominated tranche to $475.0. The reduction was funded using the $250.0 proceeds drawn from the Delayed Draw Term Loan A Facility, a replacement of $70.0 with Term Loan B Facility - Euro and previous principal payments.

The interest rate with respect to the Term Loan B Facility - USD is based on, at the Company’s option, adjusted LIBOR plus 2.75 percent (with a floor of 0.00 percent) or ABR plus 1.75 percent (with an ABR floor of 1.00 percent) and the interest rate with respect to the Term Loan B Facility - Euro is based on adjusted EURIBOR plus 3.00 percent (with a floor of 0.00 percent).

The debt facilities under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries that are borrowers or guarantors under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens.

The Company's financing agreements contain various financial covenants, including net debt to capitalization, net debt to EBITDA and net interest coverage ratio. As of June 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial and other covenants in its debt agreements. However, the Company’s current operating performance has been below expectations that existed at the time that the financial covenant levels were established, and if financial performance does not improve, we anticipate noncompliance with the net debt to EBITDA financial covenant at the end of the third quarter of 2018. The Company is in process of seeking an amendment to that covenant or obtaining a waiver thereof from our lenders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining an amendment or waiver on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

Dividends The Company paid dividends of $7.7 and $15.3 in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In May 2018, the Company announced its decision to reallocate future dividend funds towards debt reduction and other capital resource needs. As a result, there was no quarterly dividend for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The quarterly dividend was $0.10 per share for the three months ended June 30, 2017.

Contractual Obligations In the first six months ended of 2017, the Company entered into purchase commitments due within one year for materials through contract manufacturing agreements for a total negotiated price. At June 30, 2018, the Company had purchase commitments due within one year totaling $3.4 for materials through contract manufacturing agreements at negotiated prices.

The DPLTA offers the Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders, at their election, (i) the ability to put their Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary shares to Diebold KGaA in exchange for cash compensation of €55.02 per Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary share or (ii) to remain Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders and receive a recurring compensation in cash of €2.82 per Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary share for each full fiscal year of Diebold Nixdorf AG. In early August 2018, Diebold Nixdorf AG shareholders have requested redemption of approximately 2.4 shares with a value of $160. The Company expects to utilize cash on hand and borrowings under its Revolving Facility to fund the obligations. The ultimate timing and amount of any future cash payments related to the DPLTA are uncertain. 

Except for the items noted above, all contractual cash obligations with initial and remaining terms in excess of one year and contingent liabilities remained generally unchanged at June 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various arrangements not recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets that have or could have an effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. The principal off-balance sheet arrangements that the Company enters into are guarantees, operating leases and sales of finance receivables. The Company provides its global operations guarantees and standby letters of credit through various financial institutions to suppliers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers. If the Company is not able to make payment, the suppliers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers may draw on the pertinent bank. Refer to note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details of guarantees.

Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include revenue recognition, the valuation of trade, finance lease receivables, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, guarantee obligations and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, pension and post-retirement benefits and customer incentives, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors. Management monitors the economic conditions and other factors and will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 

Management believes there have been no significant changes during the six months ended June 30, 2018 to the items that the Company disclosed as its critical accounting policies and estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company operates in Argentina through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Diebold Argentina, S.A. The Argentina operations represent less than one percent of the Company's total assets and total net sales as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2018. As of June 30, 2018, the Company concluded that the Argentina financial results will be measured using the U.S. dollar as its functional currency in the third quarter of 2018 because its economy is considered highly inflationary. The operating environment in Argentina continues to present business challenges, including continuing devaluation of Argentina’s currency and high inflation.

The Company is closely monitoring developments in Argentina and intends to take steps to mitigate adverse conditions, but there can be no assurances that these actions will be able to mitigate these conditions as they may occur.

On August 15, 2016, the Company designated its €350.0 euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility as a net investment hedge of its investments in certain subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency in order to reduce volatility in stockholders' equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the euro with respect to the U.S. dollar. Effectiveness is assessed at least quarterly by confirming that the respective designated net investments' net equity balances at the beginning of any period collectively continues to equal or exceed the balance outstanding on the Company's euro-denominated term loan. Changes in value that are deemed effective are accumulated in AOCI. When the respective net investments are sold or substantially liquidated, the balance of the cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI will be reclassified into earnings. The net gain (loss) recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge foreign currency borrowings was $11.2 and $5.4 for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. On March 30, 2017, the Company de-designated €130.6 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility and on May 9, 2017, the Company designated an additional €66.8 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility as a result of its repricing described under note 11. On September 21, 2017, the Company de-designated €100.0 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility. On June 21, 2018, the Company re-designated €30.2 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility.
