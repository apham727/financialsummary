Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information

Nature of Operations 

Littelfuse, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a global manufacturer of leading technologies in circuit protection, power control and sensing. The company's products are found in automotive and commercial vehicles, industrial applications, data and telecommunications, medical devices, consumer electronics and appliances. With its broad product portfolio of fuses, semiconductors, polymers, ceramics, relays and sensors, and extensive global infrastructure, the Company’s worldwide associates partner with its customers to design, manufacture and deliver innovative, high-quality solutions for a safer, greener and increasingly connected world.

Basis of Presentation 

The Company’s accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and disclosures normally included in the consolidated balance sheets, statements of net income and comprehensive income, statements of cash flows, and statement of stockholders' equity prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted as permitted by such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. They have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 which should be read in conjunction with the disclosures therein. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and are of a normal, recurring nature. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of annual operating results.

Revenue Recognition

On December 31, 2017, the Company adopted new guidance on revenue from contracts with customers using the modified retrospective method. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Disaggregation




See Note 16, Segment Information for net sales by segment and countries.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the Company satisfies its performance obligation and control of the product is transferred to the customer. The Company’s sales arrangements with customers are predominately short term in nature and generally provide for transfer of control at the time of shipment as this is the point at which title and risk of loss of the product transfers to the customer. At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the Company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer. The amount of revenue recorded reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for goods and may include adjustments for customer allowance, rebates and price adjustments. The Company’s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third-party distributors.

The Company elected the practical expedient under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 340-40-25-4 to expense commissions when incurred as the amortization period of the commission asset the Company would have otherwise recognized is less than one year.

Revenue and Billing

The Company generally accepts orders from customers through receipt of purchase orders or electronic data interchange based on written sales agreements and purchasing contracts. Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs, and competition. Pricing is often negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the Company’s published price lists. The customer is invoiced when the Company’s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement. As the Company’s standard payment terms are less than one year, the Company elected the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. The Company also elected the practical expedient provided in ASC 606-10-25-18B to treat all product shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities, and therefore recognize the gross revenue associated with the contract, inclusive of any shipping and handling revenue. This is similar to the Company’s prior practice and therefore the effect of the new guidance is immaterial.

Ship and Debit Program

Some of the terms of the Company’s sales agreements and normal business conditions provide customers (distributors) the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced. This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a “ship and debit” program. This program allows the distributor to debit the Company for the difference between the distributors’ contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions. Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization for pricing allowances to reduce its price. When the Company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to “debit” its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price. The Company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.

Return to Stock 

The Company has a return to stock policy whereby certain customers, with prior authorization from Littelfuse management, can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit. The Company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity. Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.

Volume Rebates

The Company offers volume based sales incentives to certain customers to encourage greater product sales. If customers achieve their specific quarterly or annual sales targets, they are entitled to rebates. The Company estimates the projected amount of rebates that will be achieved by the customer and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, "Leases" (Topic 842), ("ASC 842"). This ASU requires lessees to recognize, on the balance sheet, assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases of greater than twelve months. The accounting by lessors will remain largely unchanged. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Adoption requires using a modified retrospective transition with either 1) periods prior to the adoption date being recast or 2) a cumulative-effect adjustment recognized to the opening balance of retained earnings on the adoption date with prior periods not recast.




The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” in which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. The operating results of the acquired business are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition.

IXYS Corporation

On January 17, 2018, the Company acquired IXYS Corporation (“IXYS”), a global pioneer in the power semiconductor and integrated circuit markets with a focus on medium to high voltage power control semiconductors across the industrial, communications, consumer and medical markets. IXYS has a broad customer base, serving more than 3,500 customers through its direct sales force and global distribution partners. The acquisition of IXYS is expected to accelerate the Company’s growth across the power control market driven by IXYS’s extensive power semiconductor portfolio and technology expertise. With IXYS, the Company will be able to diversify and expand its presence within industrial electronics markets, leveraging the strong IXYS 

industrial OEM customer base. The Company also expects to increase long-term penetration of its power semiconductor portfolio in automotive markets, expanding its global content per vehicle.


Based on the $207.5 per share opening price of Littelfuse common stock on January 17, 2018, the consideration IXYS stockholders received in exchange of their IXYS common stock in the acquisition had a value of $814.8 million comprised of $380.6 million of cash and $434.2 million of Littelfuse stock. In addition to the consideration transferred related to IXYS common stock, the value of consideration transferred, and included in the purchase price, related to IXYS stock options that were converted to Littelfuse stock options, or cash settled, had a value of $41.7 million. As a result, total consideration was valued at $856.5 million.



Approximately $49.1 million of net receivables was included in IXYS’s current assets. All IXYS goodwill, other assets and liabilities were recorded in the Electronics segment and primarily reflected in the Americas and European geographic areas. The goodwill resulting from this acquisition consists largely of the Company’s expected future product sales and synergies from combining IXYS’s products and technology with the Company’s existing electronics product portfolio. Goodwill resulting from the IXYS acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recognized a charge of $17.9 million for the amortization of the fair value inventory step-up. The step-up was a non-cash charge to cost of goods and reflected as other non-segment costs. The Company recognized approximately $5.9 million of stock compensation expense related to IXYS stock options converted to Littelfuse stock options during the three months ended March 31, 2018 of which $4.5 million was recognized immediately as it related to prior services periods.

During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company incurred approximately $10.2 million of legal and professional fees related to this acquisition which were primarily recognized as selling, general, and administrative expenses. These costs were reflected as other non-segment costs.

Pro Forma Results

The following table summarizes, on a pro forma basis, the combined results of operations of the Company and IXYS as though the acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2017. The pro forma amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of either the actual consolidated results had the IXYS acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2017 or of future consolidated operating results.









4. Property, Plant, and Equipment



The Company recorded depreciation expense of $13.1 million and $11.6 million for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively.

5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets





During the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the Company recorded amortization expense of $10.2 million and $12.0 million, respectively, for intangible assets with definite lives.




The Company leases office and production space under various non-cancelable operating leases that expire no later than 2025. Certain real estate leases include one or more options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion. Options to extend the lease are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option.The Company also has production equipment, office equipment and vehicles under operating leases. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option that is reasonably certain of exercise. Certain leases include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. The lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantee or material restrictive covenants.

The Company does not have a published credit rating because it has no publicly traded debt; therefore, the Company is generating its incremental borrowing rate (IBR), using a synthetic credit rating model that compares its credit quality to other rated companies based on certain financial metrics and ratios. The reference rate will be based on the yield curve of companies with similar credit quality based on the metrics and adjusted for currency in regions where we have significant operations.

All leases with an initial term of 12 months or less that do not include an option to extend or purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise (“short-term leases”) are not recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Short-term lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 











Employee-related liabilities consist primarily of payroll, sales commission, bonus, employee benefit accruals and workers’ compensation. Bonus accruals include amounts earned pursuant to the Company’s primary employee incentive compensation plans. Other accrued liabilities include miscellaneous operating accruals and other client-related liabilities.

8. Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges





For the three months ended March 30, 2019, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of $2.7 million, of which $2.5 million was for employee termination costs and $0.3 million for other restructuring charges. These charges primarily related to reorganization of operations and selling, general and administrative functions as well as integration of IXYS within the Electronics segment and the reorganization of operations in the commercial vehicle products and automotive sensors businesses within the Automotive segment. 

In April 2019, we announced the closure of a European manufacturing facility in the automotive sensors business within the Automotive segment. The Company estimates the restructuring costs associated with this plant closure to be approximately $5.0 million to $7.0 million. 


For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of $0.8 million for employee termination costs mainly related to the Electronics segment.

The restructuring reserves as of March 30, 2019 and December 29, 2018 are $2.1 million and $3.9 million, respectively. The restructuring reserves are included within accrued liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company anticipates the remaining payments associated with employee terminations will be completed in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019.





On March 4, 2016, the Company entered into a five-year credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with a group of lenders for up to $700.0 million. The Credit Agreement consisted of an unsecured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) of $575.0 million and an unsecured term loan credit facility (“Term Loan”) of up to $125.0 million. In addition, the Company had the ability, from time to time, to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan by up to an additional $150.0 million, in the aggregate, in each case in minimum increments of $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions and the agreement of participating lenders.

On October 13, 2017, the Company amended the Credit Agreement to increase the Revolving Credit Facility from $575.0 million to $700.0 million and increase the Term Loan from $125.0 million to $200.0 million and to extend the expiration date from March 4, 2021 to October 13, 2022. The Credit Agreement also includes the option for the Company to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan by up to an additional $300.0 million, in the aggregate, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. Term Loans may be made in up to two advances. The first advance of $125.0 million occurred on October 13, 2017 and the second advance of $75.0 million occurred on January 16, 2018. For the Term Loan, the Company is required to make quarterly principal payments of 1.25% of the original term loan ($2.5 million with the second advance on January 16, 2018) through maturity, with the remaining balance due on October 13, 2022. The Company paid quarterly principal payments of $5.0 million on the term loan during the three months ended March 30, 2019.

Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either LIBOR, fixed for interest periods of one, two, three or six-month periods, plus 1.00% to 2.00%, or at the bank’s Base Rate, as defined, plus 0.00% to 1.00%, based upon the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined. The Company is also required to pay commitment fees on unused portions of the credit agreement ranging from 0.15% to 0.25%, based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement. The credit agreement includes representations, covenants and events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature. The effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the credit facility was 3.75% at March 30, 2019.

As of March 30, 2019, the Company had $0.1 million outstanding in letters of credit and had available $699.9 million of borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. At March 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.

Senior Notes

On December 8, 2016, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold €212 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in two series. The funding date for the Euro denominated senior notes occurred on December 8, 2016 for €117 million in aggregate amount of 1.14% Senior Notes, Series A, due December 8, 2023 


On December 8, 2016, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold $125 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in two series. On February 15, 2017, $25 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.03% Senior Notes, Series A, due February 15, 2022 (“U.S. Senior Notes, Series A due 2022”), and $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.74% Senior Notes, Series B, due February 15, 2027 (“U.S. Senior Notes, Series B due 2027”) (together, the “U.S. Senior Notes due 2022 and 2027”) were funded. Interest on the U.S. Senior Notes due 2022 and 2027 is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15, commencing August 15, 2017.

On November 15, 2017, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company issued and sold $175 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in two series. On January 16, 2018, $50 million aggregate principal amount of 3.48% Senior Notes, Series A, due February 15, 2025 (“U.S. Senior Notes, Series A due 2025”) and $125 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.78% Senior Notes, Series B, due February 15, 2030 (“U.S. Senior Notes, Series B due 2030”) (together the “U.S. Senior Notes due 2025 and 2030” and with the Euro Senior Notes and the U.S. Senior Notes due 2022 and 2027, the “Senior Notes”) were funded. Interest on the U.S. Senior Notes due 2025 and 2030 is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15, commencing on August 15, 2018.

The Senior Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, or applicable state securities laws. The Senior Notes are general unsecured senior obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company.

The Senior Notes are subject to certain customary covenants, including limitations on the Company’s ability, with certain exceptions, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales and transactions with affiliates, to engage in any business that would substantially change the general business of the Company, and to incur liens. In addition, the Company is required to satisfy certain financial covenants and tests relating to, among other matters, interest coverage and leverage. At March 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Notes.

The Company may redeem the Senior Notes upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of a make-whole amount to noteholders, and are required to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at par following certain events, including a change of control.

Interest paid on all Company debt was $8.0 million and $4.0 million in the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively.

10. Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities


Level 1—Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;

Level 2—Valuations based upon quoted prices for similar instruments, prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-derived valuations, all of whose significant inputs are observable, and

Level 3—Valuations based upon one or more significant unobservable inputs.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value and their classification in the valuation hierarchy.

Investments in Equity Securities

Investments in equity securities listed on a national market or exchange are valued at the last sales price and classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy and recorded in investments and other assets.

The Company has certain convertible debt and convertible preferred stock investments that are accounted for under the cost method reflected in other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the three months ended March 30, 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges of $2.8 million in Other expense (income), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income to adjust these certain investments to their estimated fair value of $1.2 million. The fair value of these investments are measured on a nonrecurring basis and determined to be Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. The Company's accounting and finance management determines the valuation policies and procedures for Level 3 fair value measurements and is responsible for the development and determination of unobservable inputs. 

Mutual Funds

The Company has a non-qualified Supplemental Retirement and Savings Plan which provides additional retirement benefits for certain management employees and named executive officers by allowing participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation. The Company maintains accounts for participants through which participants make investment elections. The marketable securities are classified as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy as they are maintained in mutual funds with readily determinable fair value and recorded in other assets.

There were no changes during the quarter ended March 30, 2019 to the Company’s valuation techniques used to measure asset and liability fair values on a recurring basis. As of March 30, 2019 and December 29, 2018, the Company did not hold any non-financial assets or liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.





In addition to the methods and assumptions used for the financial instruments recorded at fair value as discussed above, the following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of other financial instruments that are not marked to market on a recurring basis. The Company’s other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and its long-term debt. Due to their short-term maturity, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable approximate their fair values. The Company’s revolving and term loan debt facilities’ fair values approximate book value at March 30, 2019 and December 29, 2018, as the rates on these borrowings are variable in nature.




The Company has company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans covering employees in the U.K., Germany, the Philippines, China, Japan, Mexico, Italy and France. The amount of the retirement benefits provided under the plans is based on years of service and final average pay.



The Company expects to make approximately $2.3 million of cash contributions to its pension plans in 2019.

12. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)









The Company recognizes the amortization of prior service costs in Other (expense) income, net within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income.


The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 30, 2019 was 20.3%, compared to an effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of 19.3%. The effective tax rates for both periods were lower than the applicable U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to income earned in lower tax jurisdictions.

14. Earnings Per Share



Potential shares of common stock relating to stock options excluded from the earnings per share calculation because their effect would be anti-dilutive were 77,047 for the three months ended March 30, 2019. No potential shares of common stock attributable to stock options were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation for the three months ended March 31, 2018.

Share Repurchase Program

The Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock under a program for the period May 1, 2018 to April 30, 2019. On April 26, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock for the period May 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020. During the  three months ended March 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 79,916 shares of its common stock totaling $13.6 million.

15. Related Party Transactions

As a result of the Company’s acquisition of IXYS, the Company has equity ownership in various investments that are accounted for under the equity method and recorded in investments in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following is a description of the investments and related party transactions.




On March 25, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the assets and liabilities of Microwave Technology, Inc. (“MWT”) resulting in a loss on disposal of $2.6 million reflected in Other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income. The operations of Microwave Technology, Inc. were included in the Electronics segment. One member of the Company’s Board of Directors is the co-owner of a company that agreed to purchase MWT. This transaction closed on April 26, 2019.



Sales, marketing, and research and development expenses are charged directly into each operating segment. Manufacturing, purchasing, logistics, customer service, finance, information technology, and human resources are shared functions that are allocated back to the three operating segments. The Company does not report inter-segment revenue because the operating segments do not record it. Certain expenses, determined by the CODM to be strategic in nature and not directly related to segments current results, are not allocated but identified as “Other”. Additionally, the Company does not allocate interest and other income, interest expense, or taxes to operating segments. These costs are not allocated to the segments, as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the segments. Although the CODM uses operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Except as discussed above, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for the Company as a whole.







The first quarter of 2018 includes approximately $38.6 million of charges primarily related to the IXYS acquisition, which include $17.9 million of purchase accounting inventory step-up charges, $11.6 million in acquisition-related and integration costs primarily related to legal, accounting and other expenses, $2.5 million in backlog amortization costs, and $4.5 million in stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior service periods and $2.1 million change in control expense related to IXYS. In addition, there were $0.8 million of employee termination costs and $0.1 million of acquisition-related expenses for other contemplated acquisitions.

This report, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, should be read in conjunction with information provided in the consolidated financial statements and the related Notes thereto appearing in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2018. 


Executive Overview

Founded in 1927, Littelfuse is a global manufacturer of leading technologies in circuit protection, power control and sensing. Sold in over 150 countries, the Company’s products are found in automotive and commercial vehicles, industrial applications, data and telecommunications, medical devices, consumer electronics and appliances. With its broad product portfolio of fuses, semiconductors, polymers, ceramics, relays and sensors, and extensive global infrastructure, the Company’s worldwide associates partner with its customers to design, manufacture and deliver innovative, high-quality solutions for a safer, greener and increasingly connected world.


Executive Summary

For the first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized net sales of $405.5 million compared to $417.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 representing a decrease of $12.3 million, or 2.9%. The decrease was primarily driven by $9.9 million or 2.4% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and decreased volume in the passenger car and automotive sensors businesses within the Automotive segment, partially offset by higher volumes in the semiconductor business in the Electronics segment as result of the IXYS acquisition completed on January 17, 2018. The Company recognized net income of $37.0 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to net income of $36.0 million, or $1.45 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in net income reflects lower non-segment charges compared to prior year primarily due to the IXYS acquisition, partially offset by lower operating income across all segments and foreign exchange losses. 

The Company continues to take actions to improve its cost structure and drive the synergies from the integration of IXYS. The Company expects to realize cost savings from the restructuring activities taken during the first quarter of 2019 including the reorganization of certain manufacturing, selling and administrative functions within the Electronics and Automotive segments. In April 2019, we announced the closure of a European manufacturing facility in the automotive sensor business within the Automotive segment. The Company estimates the restructuring costs associated with this plant closure to be approximately $5.0 million to $7.0 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $30.9 million for the three months ended March 30, 2019 as compared to $69.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflected lower earnings and higher working capital levels primarily due to the timing of supplier and customer payments.

During the three months ended March 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 79,916 shares of its common stock totaling $13.6 million. Since September 30, 2018, the Company has repurchased 471,888 shares of its common stock at an average price of $172.62 totaling $81.5 million.

Results of Operations

The following table summarizes the Company’s condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods presented. The first quarter of 2019 includes $5.1 million of non-segment charges, of which $2.7 million of restructuring charges are primarily related to employee termination costs and $2.4 million of acquisition integration charges are primarily related to the IXYS acquisition.

The first quarter of 2018 includes approximately $38.6 million of charges primarily related to the IXYS acquisition, which include $17.9 million of purchase accounting inventory step-up charges, $11.6 million in acquisition-related and integration costs primarily related to legal, accounting and other expenses, $2.5 million in backlog amortization costs, and $4.5 million in stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior service periods and $2.1 million change in control expense related to IXYS. In addition, there were $0.8 million of employee termination costs and $0.1 million of acquisition-related expenses for other contemplated acquisitions.


Net Sales

Net sales decreased $12.3 million or 2.9% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to $9.9 million or 2.4% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, lower volume in the automotive sensors and passenger car businesses within the Automotive segment, partially offset by higher sales in the semiconductor business driven by the IXYS acquisition.

Gross Profit

Gross profit was $155.2 million, or 38.3% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $149.6 million, or 35.8% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to the 2018 IXYS purchase accounting inventory step-up charge of $17.9 million, which negatively impacted the 2018 gross margin by 4.3%, partially offset by lower volume, unfavorable price impacts and product mix within the Electronics and Automotive segments.

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses were $94.6 million, or 23.3% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $112.1 million, or 26.8% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in operating expenses of $17.5 million is primarily due to lower acquisition and integration related costs of $9.2 million, reduced stock compensation expense of $4.5 million, $2.5 million of backlog amortization expense and $2.1 million of change in control expense related to the IXYS acquisition in 2018.

Operating Income

Operating income was $60.7 million, an increase of $23.1 million, or 61.5%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $37.6 million for the first quarter of 2018. The increase in operating income is due to the $17.9 million purchase accounting inventory step-up charges and the lower operating expenses noted above partially offset by lower operating income across all segments. Operating margins increased from 9.0% in the first quarter of 2018 to 15.0% in the first quarter of 2019 driven by factors mentioned above.

Income Before Income Taxes

Income before income taxes was $46.4 million, or 11.5% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $44.6 million, or 10.7% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before taxes was impacted by foreign exchange losses of $4.2 million during the three months ended March 30, 2019 compared to foreign exchange gains of $10.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018, impairment charges of $2.8 million for certain other investments and a $2.6 million loss on the disposal of a business within the Electronics segment.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense was $9.5 million, or an effective tax rate of 20.3%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $8.6 million, or an effective tax rate of 19.3%, for the first quarter of 2018. The effective tax rates for both periods were lower than the applicable U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to income earned in lower tax jurisdictions.

Segment Results of Operations




Electronics Segment

Net sales increased $1.0 million, or 0.4%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to $10.2 million increase in the semiconductor business due to the IXYS acquisition completed on January 17, 2018, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impact of $5.3 million and lower electronics products volume.

Automotive Segment

Net sales decreased $12.6 million, or 10.0%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to decreased volume in the passenger car and automotive sensors businesses and unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $4.4 million, partially offset by slightly higher volume in the commercial vehicle business. 

Industrial Segment

Net sales decreased slightly by $0.6 million, or 2.4%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to the exit of the Custom business during the second quarter of 2018 and unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $0.2 million, partially offset by higher volume across the power fuse and relay businesses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company has historically supported its liquidity needs through cash flows from operations. Management expects that the Company’s (i) current level of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, (ii) current and forecasted cash flows from operations, (iii) availability under existing funding arrangements, and (iv) access to capital in the capital markets will provide sufficient funds to support the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, investments, and debt obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.


On March 4, 2016, the Company entered into a five-year credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with a group of lenders for up to $700.0 million. The Credit Agreement consisted of an unsecured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) of $575.0 million and an unsecured term loan credit facility (“Term Loan”) of up to $125.0 million. In addition, the Company had the ability, from time to time, to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan by up to an additional $150.0 million, in the aggregate, in each case in minimum increments of $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions and the agreement of participating lenders.

On October 13, 2017, the Company amended the Credit Agreement to increase the Revolving Credit Facility from $575.0 million to $700.0 million and increase the Term Loan from $125.0 million to $200.0 million and to extend the expiration date from March 4, 2021 to October 13, 2022. The Credit Agreement also includes the option for the Company to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan by up to an additional $300.0 million, in the aggregate, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. Term Loans may be made in up to two advances. The first advance of $125.0 million occurred on October 13, 2017 and the second advance of $75.0 million occurred on January 16, 2018. For the Term Loan, the Company is required to make quarterly principal payments of 1.25% of the original term loan ($2.5 million with the second advance on January 16, 2018) through maturity, with the remaining balance due on October 13, 2022. The Company paid quarterly principle payments of $5.0 million on the term loan during the three months ended March 30, 2019.

Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either LIBOR, fixed for interest periods of one, two, three or six-month periods, plus 1.00% to 2.00%, or at the bank’s Base Rate, as defined, plus 0.00% to 1.00%, based upon the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined. The Company is also required to pay commitment fees on unused portions of the credit agreement ranging from 0.15% to 0.25%, based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement. The credit agreement includes representations, covenants and events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature. The effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the credit facility was 3.75% at March 30, 2019.

As of March 30, 2019, the Company had $0.1 million outstanding in letters of credit and had available $699.9 million of borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility.
