NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  




BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

Basis of Consolidation  


The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this report include the accounts of Watsco, all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of three joint ventures with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), in each of which Watsco maintains a controlling interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

The results of operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2018. Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment, and parts and supplies are seasonal. Furthermore, results of operations can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on weather patterns, primarily during the Summer and Winter selling seasons. Demand related to the residential central air conditioning replacement market is typically highest in the second and third quarters, and demand for heating equipment is usually highest in the fourth quarter. Demand related to the new construction market is generally evenly distributed throughout the year, subject to weather and economic conditions, including their effect on the number of housing completions.  

Equity Method Investments  

Investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Under this method of accounting, our proportionate share of the net income or loss of the investee is included in other income in our consolidated statements of income. The excess, if any, of the carrying amount of our investment over our ownership percentage in the underlying net assets of the investee is attributed to certain fair value adjustments with the remaining portion recognized as goodwill.  

Reclassifications  

Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the 2018 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income or earnings per share as previously reported.  

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Significant estimates include valuation reserves for accounts receivable, inventories and income taxes, reserves related to self-insurance programs and the valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. While we believe that these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from such estimates.  

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  

Revenue Recognition  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued a standard on revenue recognition that provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. The standard is principle-based and provides a five-step model to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. In 2015 and 2016, the FASB issued several updates to this standard. The adoption of this standard and its related amendments (collectively, the New Revenue Standard) on January 1, 2018 did not result in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings under the modified retrospective approach, nor did it have a significant impact on our consolidated net income, balance sheet or cash flow. See Note 2.  


Table of Contents 

Financial Instruments  

In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. Most prominent among the changes to the standard is the requirement that changes in the fair value of equity investments, with certain exceptions, be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income. This guidance must be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings and became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. A cumulative-effect adjustment captured the previously held unrealized losses of $301 related to our equity securities carried at fair value. See Note 4.  

Stock Compensation  

In May 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. This guidance must be applied prospectively and became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

Derivatives and Hedging  

In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for hedging derivatives. This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We elected to adopt this guidance during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted  

Leases  

In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The guidance requires the use of a modified retrospective approach to apply the standard at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements. In July 2018, updated guidance was issued which provides an additional transition method of adoption that allows entities to initially apply the standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We will adopt the guidance on January 1, 2019 using this additional transition method and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.  

Based on our preliminary assessment of our lease portfolio, we expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. However, we do not expect a material impact on our consolidated statements of income. We are in the process of collecting data and designing processes and controls to account for our leases in accordance with the new guidance. Our current minimum lease commitments are disclosed in Note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

IntangiblesGoodwill and Other  

In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this updated standard, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. An entity also should consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if any. This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  


REVENUES  

Adoption of New Revenue Standard  

We adopted the New Revenue Standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. The New Revenue Standard did not have an impact on the amount or timing of our revenue recognition; however, certain payments to customers were reclassified from expenses to a reduction from revenues, resulting in an immaterial impact to the individual financial statement line items of our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income. Results for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2018 are presented under the New Revenue Standard, while prior period results have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.  


Table of Contents 

Revenue Recognition  

Revenue primarily consists of sales of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies. We generate our revenue primarily from the sale of finished products to customers; therefore, the significant majority of our contracts are short-term in nature and have only a single performance obligation to deliver products; therefore, we satisfy our performance obligation under such contracts when we transfer control of the product to the customer. Some contracts contain a combination of product sales and services, the latter of which is distinct and accounted for as a separate performance obligation. We satisfy our performance obligations for services when we render the services within the agreed-upon service period. Total service revenue is not material and accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated revenues for both the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2018.  

Revenue is recognized when control transfers to our customers when picked up or via shipment of products or delivery of services. We measure revenue as the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services, net of any variable considerations (e.g., rights to return product, sales incentives, others) and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue for shipping and handling charges is recognized when products are delivered to the customer.  

Product Returns  

We estimate product returns based on historical experience and record them on a gross basis. Substantially all customer returns relate to products that are returned under manufacturers warranty obligations. Accrued sales returns of $14,702 at September 30, 2018 were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet.  

Sales Incentives  

We estimate sales incentives expected to be paid over the term of the program based on the most likely amounts. Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction in the transaction price and are generally paid on an annual basis.  

Disaggregation of Revenues  




As noted above, prior period amounts have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method and remain as originally reported for such periods.  

Practical Expedients  

We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

EARNINGS PER SHARE  



Diluted earnings per share for our Common stock assumes the conversion of all of our Class B common stock into Common stock as of the beginning of the fiscal year; therefore, no allocation of earnings to Class B common stock is required. At September 30, 2018 and 2017, our outstanding Class B common stock was convertible into 2,602,528 and 2,709,194 shares of our Common stock, respectively.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)  






DEBT  

We maintain an unsecured, syndicated revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases and issuances of letters of credit. Effective February 5, 2018, we decreased the borrowing capacity under this revolving credit agreement from $600,000 to $300,000. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $116,400 and $21,800, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. The credit agreement matures on July 1, 2019 and, accordingly,  


Table of Contents 

 borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement are classified as current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet at September 30, 2018. We believe that we will refinance the credit agreement at or prior to its maturity on similar terms and subject to similar conditions.  

The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants with respect to consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, and other customary restrictions. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2018.  


PURCHASE OF ADDITIONAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE  

On February 13, 2017, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise Northeast LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise II, for cash consideration of $42,688, which increased our controlling interest from 70% to 80%. Carrier Enterprise II was formed in 2011 as a joint venture with Carrier. Carrier Enterprise II had sales of approximately $545,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 40 locations in the northeastern United States and 14 locations in Mexico.  


INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY  

On June 21, 2017, our first joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise, LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, acquired an approximately 35% ownership interest in Russell Sigler, Inc. (RSI), an HVAC distributor with 2017 sales of approximately $680,000, operating from 30 locations in the Western U.S. We have an 80% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise I, and Carrier has a 20% non-controlling interest. Carrier Enterprise I acquired its ownership interest in RSI for cash consideration of $63,600, of which we contributed $50,880, and Carrier contributed $12,720. Effective June 29, 2018, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an additional 1.4% ownership interest in RSI, which increased Carrier Enterprise Is ownership interest in RSI to 36.3%. Total cash consideration of $3,760 was paid on July 5, 2018, of which we contributed $3,008 and Carrier contributed $752. Carrier Enterprise I is a party to a shareholders agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) with RSI and its shareholders. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, RSIs shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on either book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price paid for its investment in RSI. RSIs shareholders may transfer their respective shares of RSI common stock only to members of the Sigler family or to Carrier Enterprise I, and, at any time from and after the date on which Carrier Enterprise I owns 85% or more of RSIs outstanding common stock, it has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from RSIs shareholders the remaining outstanding shares of RSI common stock. Additionally, Carrier Enterprise I has the right to appoint two of RSIs six board members. Given Carrier Enterprise Is 36.3% ownership interest in RSI and its right to appoint two out of RSIs six board members, this investment in RSI is accounted for under the equity method.  


ACQUISITION  

On August 23, 2018, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired Alert Labs Inc., a technology company based in Ontario, Canada for cash consideration of $5,889 and the issuance of 47,103 shares of Common stock, having a fair value of $8,180.  

The results of operations of the acquisition have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The pro forma effect of the acquisition was not deemed significant to the consolidated financial statements.  


DERIVATIVES  

We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the earnings impact that foreign exchange rate fluctuations would otherwise have on certain monetary liabilities that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies.  

Cash Flow Hedging Instruments  

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement of these derivatives results in reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings for the period in which the settlement of these instruments occurs. The maximum period for which we hedge our cash flow using these instruments is 12 months. Accordingly, at September 30, 2018, all of our open foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of one year or less. The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at September 30, 2018 was $36,800, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through June 2019.  


Table of Contents 



At September 30, 2018, we expected an estimated $3 pre-tax gain to be reclassified into earnings to reflect the fixed prices obtained from foreign exchange hedging within the next 12 months.  

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments  

We have also entered into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are either not designated as hedges or did not qualify for hedge accounting. These derivative instruments were effective economic hedges for all of the periods presented. The fair value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments at September 30, 2018 was $12,000, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through November 2018.  

We recognized losses of $(108), $(502), $(299) and $(912) from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  

The following table summarizes the fair value of derivative instruments, which consist solely of foreign exchange contracts, included in other current assets and accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets. See Note 10.  



FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  




Table of Contents 


Equity securities  the investments are exchange-traded equity securities. Fair values for these investments are based on closing stock prices from active markets and are therefore classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  

Derivative financial instruments  these derivatives are foreign currency forward and option contracts. See Note 9. Fair value is based on observable market inputs, such as forward rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivatives within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  

There were no transfers in or out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.  


SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY  

At-the-Market Offering Program  


During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2017, we sold 35,000 shares of Common stock under the ATM Program for net proceeds of $5,391. Direct costs of $285 incurred in connection with the offering were charged against the proceeds from the sale of Common stock and reflected as a reduction of paid-in capital. At September 30, 2017, $244,560 remained available for sale under the Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, we had completed the offering of shares under the ATM Program. The net proceeds were primarily used to repay outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes.  

Common Stock Dividends  

We paid cash dividends of $1.45, $1.25, $4.15 and $3.35 per share of both Common stock and Class B common stock during the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  

Non-Vested Restricted Stock  

During the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we granted 10,000, 9,000, 110,109 and 164,899 shares of non-vested restricted stock, respectively.  

During the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, 8,830, 12,354, 21,754 and 32,454 shares of Common stock, respectively, with aggregate fair market values of $1,562, $1,893, $3,775 and $4,664, respectively, were withheld as payment in lieu of cash to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of non-vested restricted stock. These shares were retired upon delivery.  

Exercise of Stock Options  

During the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, 8,600, 9,084, 53,184 and 25,084 stock options, respectively, were exercised for Common stock. Cash received from common stock issued as a result of stock options exercised during the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, was $856, $801, $4,837 and $2,111, respectively.  

During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2018, 376 shares of Common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $69 and 7,027 shares of Common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $1,269, respectively, were withheld as payment in lieu of cash for stock option exercises and related tax withholdings. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2017, 350 shares of Common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $53 were withheld as payment in lieu of cash for stock option exercises and related tax withholdings. These shares were retired upon delivery.  

Employee Stock Purchase Plan  

During the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, 2,235, 2,718, 6,716 and 6,977 shares of Common stock, respectively, were issued under our employee stock purchase plan for which we received net proceeds of $382, $402, $1,142 and $1,004, respectively.  


Table of Contents 


During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we issued 17,318 and 16,389 shares of Common stock, respectively, to our profit sharing retirement plan, representing the Common stock discretionary matching contributions of $2,945 and $2,428, respectively.  

Non-controlling Interest  




COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

Litigation, Claims and Assessments  

We are involved in litigation incidental to the operation of our business. We vigorously defend all matters in which we or our subsidiaries are named defendants and, for insurable losses, maintain significant levels of insurance to protect against adverse judgments, claims or assessments that may affect us. Although the adequacy of existing insurance coverage and the outcome of any legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, based on the current information available, we do not believe the ultimate liability associated with any known claims or litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  

Self-Insurance  

Self-insurance reserves are maintained relative to company-wide casualty insurance and health benefit programs. The level of exposure from catastrophic events is limited by the purchase of stop-loss and aggregate liability reinsurance coverage. When estimating the self-insurance liabilities and related reserves, management considers a number of factors, which include historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and valuations provided by independent third-party actuaries. Management reviews its assumptions with its independent third-party actuaries to evaluate whether the self-insurance reserves are adequate. If actual claims or adverse development of loss reserves occur and exceed these estimates, additional reserves may be required. Reserves in the amounts of $2,562 and $2,344 at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, were established related to such programs and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets.  


RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

Purchases from Carrier and its affiliates comprised 64%, 62%, 63% and 62% of all inventory purchases made during the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, approximately $93,000 and $75,000, respectively, was payable to Carrier and its affiliates, net of receivables. Our joint ventures with Carrier also sell HVAC products to Carrier and its affiliates. Revenues in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 included approximately $28,000, $19,000, $65,000 and $51,000, respectively, of sales to Carrier and its affiliates. We believe these transactions are conducted on terms equivalent to an arms-length basis in the ordinary course of business.  



Table of Contents 

A member of our Board of Directors is the Senior Chairman of Greenberg Traurig, P.A., which serves as our principal outside counsel for compliance and acquisition-related legal services. During the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we paid this firm $0, $71, $18 and $291 for services performed, respectively, and $113 was payable at September 30, 2018.  


SUBSEQUENT EVENT  

On October 23, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the quarterly cash dividend per share of Common and Class B common stock to $1.60 per share from $1.45 per share, beginning with the dividend that will be paid in January 2019.

Table of Contents 

The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements, including the notes thereto, included under Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, reference should be made to our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and related Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

Company Overview  


Revenues primarily consist of sales of air conditioning, heating, and refrigeration equipment, and related parts and supplies. Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of selling expenses, the largest components of which are salaries, commissions, and marketing expenses that are variable and correlate to changes in sales. Other significant selling, general and administrative expenses relate to the operation of warehouse facilities, including a fleet of trucks and forklifts, and facility rent, which are payable mostly under non-cancelable operating leases.  

Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment, and parts and supplies are seasonal. Furthermore, results of operations can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on weather patterns, primarily during the Summer and Winter selling seasons. Demand related to the residential central air conditioning replacement market is typically highest in the second and third quarters, and demand for heating equipment is usually highest in the fourth quarter. Demand related to the new construction market is generally evenly distributed throughout the year, subject to weather and economic conditions, including their effect on the number of housing completions.  

Joint Ventures with Carrier Corporation  

In 2009, we formed a joint venture with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, in which Carrier contributed 95 of its company-owned locations in 13 Sun Belt states and Puerto Rico, and its export division in Miami, Florida, and we contributed 15 locations that distributed Carrier products. In July 2012, we exercised our option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased our ownership interest to 70%; and, on July 1, 2014, we exercised our last remaining option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased our controlling interest to 80%. Neither Watsco nor Carrier has any remaining options to purchase additional ownership interests in Carrier Enterprise I or any of our other joint ventures with Carrier, which are described below.  

In 2011, we formed a second joint venture with Carrier and completed two additional transactions. In April 2011, Carrier contributed 28 of its company-owned locations in the Northeast U.S., and we contributed 14 locations in the Northeast U.S. In July 2011, we purchased Carriers distribution operations in Mexico, which included seven locations. Collectively, the Northeast locations and the Mexico operations are referred to as Carrier Enterprise II. On November 29, 2016, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and, on February 13, 2017, we again purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, which together increased our controlling interest to 80%.  

In 2012, we formed a third joint venture, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise III, with UTC Canada Corporation, referred to as UTC Canada, an affiliate of Carrier. Carrier contributed 35 of its company-owned locations in Canada to Carrier Enterprise III. We have a 60% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise III, and UTC Canada has a 40% non-controlling interest.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. At least quarterly, management reevaluates its judgments and estimates, which are based on historical experience, current trends, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  

Our critical accounting policies are included in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2018. We believe that there have been no significant changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2018 to the critical accounting policies disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Results of Operations  




The following narratives reflect our ownership interest in Russell Sigler, Inc. (RSI), in which we purchased an approximately 35% ownership interest in June 2017 and an additional 1.4% ownership interest in June 2018, and our additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, which we acquired in February 2017. We did not acquire any material businesses during 2018 or 2017.  



Third Quarter of 2018 Compared to Third Quarter of 2017  

Revenues  

Revenues for the third quarter of 2018 increased $66.4 million, or 5%, including $3.4 million from locations opened and acquired during the preceding 12 months, offset by $3.8 million from locations closed. On a same-store basis, revenues increased $66.8 million, or 5%, as compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting a 7% increase in sales of HVAC equipment (68% of sales), which included a 6% increase in residential HVAC equipment and a 9% increase in commercial HVAC equipment, a 4% increase in sales of other HVAC products (28% of sales) and flat sales of commercial refrigeration products (4% of sales). The increase in same-store revenues was primarily due to realization of price increases, demand for the replacement of residential and commercial HVAC equipment and a higher mix of high-efficiency air conditioning and heating systems, which sell at higher unit prices.  


Table of Contents 

Gross Profit  

Gross profit for the third quarter of 2018 increased $23.1 million, or 8%, primarily as a result of increased revenues. Gross profit margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 improved 50 basis-points to 24.6% versus 24.1% for the same period in 2017, primarily due to an improvement in selling margins for HVAC equipment.  

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2018 increased $16.7 million, or 9%, primarily due to increased revenues, additional sales and service-related headcount and an increase in performance-based compensation specific to certain markets. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased to 15.5% versus 14.9% for the same period in 2017. On a same-store basis, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9% as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to our inability to leverage fixed operating costs to the same extent as in 2017.  

Other Income  

Other income of $3.7 million and $2.3 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, represents our share of the net income of RSI.  

Interest Expense, Net  

Net interest expense for the third quarter of 2018 decreased $1.1 million, or 51%, primarily as a result of a decrease in average outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a higher effective interest rate for the 2018 period, in each case under our revolving credit facility, as compared to the same period in 2017.  

Income Taxes  

Income taxes decreased to $24.4 million for the third quarter of 2018 as compared to $32.3 million for the third quarter of 2017 and are a composite of the income taxes attributable to our wholly owned operations and income taxes attributable to the Carrier joint ventures, which are primarily taxed as partnerships for income tax purposes. The effective income tax rates attributable to us were 23.3% and 32.8% for the quarters ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  

Net Income Attributable to Watsco, Inc.  

Net income attributable to Watsco for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased $14.1 million, or 22%, compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenues, expanded profit margins, lower interest expense, net, and lower income taxes, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues, as discussed above.  

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017  

Revenues  

Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $177.7 million, or 5%, including $14.0 million from locations opened and acquired during the preceding 12 months, offset by $10.3 million from locations closed. On a same-store basis, revenues increased $174.0 million, or 5%, as compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting a 7% increase in sales of HVAC equipment (68% of sales), which included a 7% increase in residential HVAC equipment and a 6% increase in commercial HVAC equipment, a 5% increase in sales of other HVAC products (28% of sales) and flat sales of commercial refrigeration products (4% of sales). The increase in same-store revenues was primarily due to realization of price increases and demand for the replacement of residential and commercial HVAC equipment. Revenues from sales of residential HVAC equipment also benefited from an improved sales mix of higher-efficiency air conditioning and heating systems, which sell at higher unit prices.  

Gross Profit  

Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $45.9 million, or 6%, primarily as a result of increased revenues. Gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 improved 10 basis-points to 24.5% versus 24.4%, primarily due to increased demand for higher-efficiency residential HVAC equipment and an improvement in selling margins for HVAC equipment.  

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $31.0 million, or 6%, primarily due to increased revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased to 15.9% versus 15.8% for the same period in 2017. On a same-store basis, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to our inability to leverage fixed operating costs to the same extent as in 2017.

Other Income  

Other income of $8.5 million and $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, represents our share of the net income of RSI.  

Interest Expense, Net  

Net interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased $2.6 million, or 53%, primarily as a result of a decrease in average outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a higher effective interest rate for the 2018 period, in each case under our revolving credit facility, as compared to the same period in 2017.  

Income Taxes  

Income taxes decreased to $63.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to $82.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and are a composite of the income taxes attributable to our wholly owned operations and income taxes attributable to the Carrier joint ventures, which are primarily taxed as partnerships for income tax purposes. The effective income tax rates attributable to us were 23.6% and 33.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  

Net Income Attributable to Watsco, Inc.  

Net income attributable to Watsco for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $38.4 million, or 23%, compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenues and other income, expanded profit margins, lower interest expense, net, and lower income taxes as discussed above.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  


       

cash needed to fund our business (primarily working capital requirements);  

       

borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility;  

       

the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms;  

       

acquisitions, including joint ventures and investments in unconsolidated entities;  

       

dividend payments;  

       

capital expenditures; and  

       

the timing and extent of common stock repurchases.  

Sources and Uses of Cash  

We rely on cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including dividend payments (to the extent declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, business acquisitions, and development of our long-term operating and technology strategies. Additionally, we may generate cash through proceeds from the issuance and sale of our Common stock.  

As of September 30, 2018, we had $67.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which $57.4 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. The repatriation of cash balances from our foreign subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to capital controls; however, these balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations of our foreign subsidiaries.  

We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand, and funds available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that our current sources of available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements. While we have the intent and current ability to refinance our revolving credit agreement on similar terms and subject to similar conditions on a long-term basis prior to its maturity in 2019, there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance with the same terms and conditions.

Working Capital  

Working capital increased to $993.0 million at September 30, 2018 from $920.9 million at December 31, 2017, reflecting higher levels of accounts receivable and inventories, primarily due to the seasonality of our business.  

Cash Flows  



The individual items contributing to cash flow changes for the periods presented are detailed in the condensed consolidated unaudited statements of cash flows contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

Operating Activities  

The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the timing of payments for accrued expenses and other current liabilities and higher accounts receivable driven by increased sales volume, partially offset by a lower increase in inventory and higher net income in the 2018 period.  

Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing activities was lower due to the purchase of an ownership interest in RSI for $63.6 million in 2017, partially offset by an acquisition for cash consideration of $5.9 million and the purchase of an additional ownership interest in RSI for $3.8 million in 2018.  

Financing Activities  

The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds borrowed under our revolving credit agreement in the 2018 period and the purchase of an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II for $42.7 million in 2017, partially offset by an increase in dividends paid in 2018.  

Revolving Credit Agreement  

We maintain an unsecured, syndicated revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases, and issuances of letters of credit. Effective February 5, 2018, we decreased the borrowing capacity under this revolving credit agreement from $600.0 million to $300.0 million. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $116.4 million and $21.8 million were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement, respectively. The credit agreement matures on July 1, 2019 and accordingly, borrowings outstanding are classified as current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet at September 30, 2018. We believe that we will refinance the credit agreement at or prior to its maturity on similar terms and subject to similar conditions.  

The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants with respect to consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, and other customary restrictions. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2018.  

Purchase of Additional Ownership Interest in Joint Venture  

On February 13, 2017, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II for cash consideration of $42.7 million, which increased our controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise II to 80%. We used borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to finance this acquisition.

Investment in Unconsolidated Entity  

On June 21, 2017, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an approximately 35% ownership interest in RSI, an HVAC distributor operating from 30 locations in the Western U.S. for cash consideration of $63.6 million, of which we contributed $50.9 million, and Carrier contributed $12.7 million. Effective June 29, 2018, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an additional 1.4% ownership interest in RSI, which increased Carrier Enterprise Is ownership interest in RSI to 36.3%. Total cash consideration of $3.8 million was paid on July 5, 2018, of which we contributed $3.0 million and Carrier contributed $0.8 million. Carrier Enterprise I is a party to a shareholders agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) with RSI and its shareholders. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, RSIs shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on either book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price paid for its investment in RSI. RSIs shareholders may transfer their respective shares of RSI common stock only to members of the Sigler family or to Carrier Enterprise I, and, at any time from and after the date on which Carrier Enterprise I owns 85% or more of RSIs outstanding common stock, it has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from RSIs shareholders the remaining outstanding shares of RSI common stock. We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand, and funds available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to purchase any additional ownership interests in RSI.  

Acquisitions  

On August 23, 2018, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired Alert Labs Inc., a technology company based in Ontario, Canada for cash consideration of $5.9 million and the issuance of 47,103 shares of Common stock, having a fair value of $8.2 million.  


Common Stock Dividends  


At-the-Market Offering Program  


During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2017, we sold 35,000 shares of Common stock under the ATM Program for net proceeds of $5.4 million. Direct costs of $0.3 million incurred in connection with the offering were charged against the proceeds from the sale of Common stock and reflected as a reduction of paid-in capital. At September 30, 2017, $244.6 million remained available for sale under the Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, we had completed the offering of shares under the ATM Program. The net proceeds were primarily used to repay outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes.  

Company Share Repurchase Program  

In September 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, at managements discretion, of up to 7,500,000 shares of common stock in the open market or via private transactions. Shares repurchased under the program are accounted for using the cost method and result in a reduction of shareholders equity. No shares were repurchased during the quarters ended September 30, 2018 or 2017. In aggregate, 6,370,913 shares of Common and Class B common stock have been repurchased at a cost of $114.4 million since the inception of the program. At September 30, 2018, there were 1,129,087 shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the program.
