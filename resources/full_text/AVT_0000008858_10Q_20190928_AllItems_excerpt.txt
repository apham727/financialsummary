NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

​

1. Basis of presentation and new accounting pronouncements

​

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly Avnet, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries’ (collectively, the “Company” or “Avnet”) financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

​

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

​

Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019.

​

Certain reclassifications have been made in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation.

​

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements

​

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” and its related amendments (collectively “ASC 842”) on June 30, 2019 (the first day of fiscal 2020) using the modified transition approach without restating the comparative period consolidated financial statements. The standard requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability for all leases.

 ​

The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations or retained earnings. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance that allowed, among other things, the historical lease classification to be carried forward without reassessment and the hindsight practical expedient. The Company elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for its real estate leases. Refer to Note 5 for additional disclosures related to leases.

​

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” and its related amendments (collectively “ASC 815”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASC 815 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

​


​

In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Technology Solutions business (“TS business”) to Tech Data Corporation (the “Buyer”). The TS business and the financial impacts of the divestiture are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. In August 2018, the Company executed a settlement agreement with the Buyer resulting in a final adjustment of $120.0 million and a final geographic allocation of the TS business sales price for tax reporting purposes. This incremental consideration received from the sale of the TS business as well as cash settlements from the resolution of indemnification claims and other cash reimbursements have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations investing activities. Income tax payments related to the gain on sale of the TS business have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations operating activities.

​

Under the contractual terms of the sale of the TS business, the Company has indemnified the Buyer for certain liabilities including tax related matters, which may result in future indemnification expenses and indemnification payments to the Buyer depending upon the outcome of those matters subject to indemnification.

​

​

3. Goodwill and intangible assets

​

Goodwill

​

The following table presents the change in goodwill by reportable segment for the three months ended September 28, 2019. 



​

The Company evaluates each quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than their carrying value, which would require the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. Indicators the Company evaluates to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary include, but are not limited to, (i) a sustained decrease in share price or market capitalization as of any fiscal quarter end, (ii) changes in the macroeconomic or industry environments, (iii) the results of and the amount of time passed since the last goodwill impairment test and (iv) the long-term expected financial performance of its reporting units. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company concluded that an interim goodwill impairment test was not required.

​

AVNET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Securitization Program”) in the United States with a group of financial institutions to allow the Company to transfer, on an ongoing revolving basis, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable, to provide security or collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of $500 million. The Securitization Program does not qualify for off balance sheet accounting treatment and any borrowings under the Securitization Program are recorded as debt in the consolidated balance sheets. Under the Securitization Program, the Company legally sells and isolates certain U.S. trade accounts receivable into a wholly owned and consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Such receivables, which are recorded within “Receivables” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $839.6 million and $857.3 million at September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019, respectively. The Securitization Program contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold. The Securitization Program also requires the Company to maintain certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019. The Securitization Program expires in August 2020 and as a result the Company has classified outstanding balances as short-term debt as of September 28, 2019. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a one-month LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.75%. The facility fee on the unused balance of the facility is up to 0.35%.

​



​

The Company has a five-year $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of banks, consisting of revolving credit facilities and the issuance of up to $200.0 million of letters of credit and up to $300.0 million of loans in certain approved currencies, which expires in June 2023. Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Facility may be increased up to $1.50 billion. Under the Credit Facility, the Company may select from various interest rate options, currencies and maturities. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants including various limitations on debt incurrence, share repurchases, dividends, investments and capital expenditures. The Credit Facility also includes financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of September 28, 2019 and June 29, 2019. As of September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019, there were $4.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility.

​

AVNET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

As of September 28, 2019, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.83 billion and $1.91 billion, respectively. At June 29, 2019, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.72 billion and $1.78 billion, respectively. Fair value for the public notes was estimated based upon quoted market prices and for other forms of debt fair value approximates carrying value due to the market based variable nature of the interest rates on those debt facilities.

​


​

Substantially all the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases and are predominately related to real property for distribution centers, office space and integration facilities with a remaining lease term of up to 19 years. The Company’s equipment leases are primarily for automobiles and equipment and are not material to the consolidated financial statements.

​

The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception based on whether it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration. Lease right-of-use assets (“operating lease assets”) and associated liabilities (“operating lease liabilities”) are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Certain lease agreements may include one or more options to extend or terminate a lease. Lease terms are inclusive of these options if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. 

​

The Company’s leases generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit borrowing rate, as such, the discount rate used to calculate present value is the Company’s incremental secured borrowing rate. The incremental secured borrowing rates used at the date of adoption for each lease varies in accordance with the remaining lease term and the currency of the lease payments. Lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included as a component of “Selling, general, and administrative expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations. Lease payments are primarily fixed; however, certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the measurement of operating lease assets and liabilities.

​

6. Derivative financial instruments

​

Many of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies. This subjects the Company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging (e.g., offsetting receivables and payables in the same foreign currency) as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward foreign exchange contracts typically with maturities of less than 60 days (“economic hedges”), but no longer than one year. The Company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not economically hedged. The Company adjusts any economic hedges to fair value through the consolidated statements of operations primarily within “Other income (expense), net.” The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, which are based upon Level 2 criteria under the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy, are classified in the captions “Prepaid and other current assets” or “Accrued expenses and other,” as applicable, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of September 28, 2019 and June 29, 2019. The Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with various financial institutions related to derivative financial instruments allow for the right of offset. The Company’s policy is to present derivative financial instruments with the same counterparty as either a net asset or liability when the right of offset exists.

​

The Company generally does not hedge its investments in its foreign operations. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and monitors the financial stability and credit standing of its counterparties.

​


AVNET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

​



​



​

Under the Company’s economic hedging policies, gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments are classified within the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations as the underlying assets or liabilities being economically hedged.

​

7. Commitments and contingencies

​

From time to time, the Company may become a party to, or be otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of conducting its business. While litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, management does not anticipate that any such matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 

​


​

As of September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019, the Company had aggregate estimated liabilities of $14.7 million classified within accrued expenses and other for such compliance-related matters that were reasonably estimable as of such dates.

​

AVNET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


​

The Company’s effective tax rate on its income from continuing operations before taxes was (22.7)% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared with 27.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company’s effective tax rate was favorably impacted primarily by (i) the release of unrecognized tax benefit reserves and (ii) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company’s effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) an adjustment to the provisional estimate for the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability recorded under the requirements of recent tax law changes in the United States (the “Act”) and (ii) increases in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by (iii) an adjustment to the provisional deferred tax impacts of the Act and (iv) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.

​

The Company’s effective tax rates in fiscal years 2019 and 2020 are based on the Company’s interpretation of tax regulations under the Act including the computation of Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”). The Company has made a policy election to account for any impacts of the GILTI tax as a period expense. The Company’s effective tax rate may change in future periods due to changes in U.S. tax regulations and the issuance of additional guidance related to the Act.

​


​



​

​

The Company expects to make contributions to the Plan of $8.0 million during fiscal 2020. There were no contributions made during the first quarter of fiscal 2020.

​

Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, to other income (expense), net during the first quarters of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were not material and substantially all related to net periodic pension costs including recognition of actuarial losses and amortization of prior service costs and credits.

Share repurchase program

​

In August 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $500 million increase in the Company’s existing share repurchase program, increasing the cumulative total of authorized share repurchases to $2.95 billion of common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors such as share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and prevailing market conditions. During the three months ended September 28, 2019, the Company repurchased 2.6 million shares under this program for a total cost of $112.1 million. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had $593.3 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

​


​


​


​

●Sales adjusted for certain items that impact the year-over-year analysis, which includes the impact of certain acquisitions by adjusting Avnet’s prior periods to include the sales of acquired businesses, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Sales taking into account these adjustments are referred to as “organic sales.”

​


​


​


​

Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes. However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

​

OVERVIEW

​

Organization

​

Avnet, Inc. (the “Company” or “Avnet”), is a global technology solutions company with an extensive ecosystem delivering design, product, marketing and supply chain expertise for customers at every stage of the product lifecycle. Avnet transforms ideas into intelligent solutions, reducing the time, cost and complexities of bringing products to market around the world. Founded in 1921 and incorporated in New York in 1955, the Company works with over 1,400 technology suppliers to serve 2.1 million customers in more than 140 countries.

​


​

Results of Operations

​

Executive Summary

​

Sales of $4.63 billion were down 9.0% year over year and 7.8% in constant currency as compared to prior year first quarter sales of $5.09 billion. Both operating groups in all three regions contributed to the year-over-year decline in sales as the global industry-wide slowdown resulted in weaker year over year demand.

 ​

Gross profit margin of 11.7% decreased 76 basis points compared to 12.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 primarily due to gross profit declines at both EC and Farnell. 

​

Operating income of $62.7 million decreased $84.1 million or 57.3% as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Operating income margin was 1.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared with a 2.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Both periods included amortization and restructuring, integration and other expenses. Excluding these expenses from both periods, adjusted operating income margin was 2.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to 3.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, a decline of 127 basis points. The decrease in operating income and operating income margin is primarily due to the decrease in sales and gross profit margin, partially offset by reductions in operating expenses from the Company’s restructuring and integration efforts.

​

​

Sales

​

The following table presents reported and organic sales growth rates between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 for the first quarter of fiscal 2020.


​

Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were down $459.9 million, or 9.0%, from the prior year first quarter sales of $5.09 billion. Sales in constant currency decreased 7.8% over the prior year first quarter with all three regions of both operating groups contributing to the decline. These decreases are primarily due to the current industry-wide economic downturn.

​

EC sales of $4.29 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased $416.6 million or 8.8% from the prior year first quarter sales of $4.71 billion. EC sales in constant currency declined 7.7% in constant currency year over year. Farnell sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were $335.8 million, a decrease of $43.2 million or 11.4% from the prior year first quarter sales of $379.1 million. Farnell sales in constant currency declined 9.0% year over year.

​

 On a regional basis, sales declined 4.4% in the Americas, 10.5% in EMEA in constant currency and 7.7% in Asia in constant currency. All the regional declines are primarily due to the industry-wide economic downturn impacting the demand for electronic components.

​

As a result of the recent notification the Company received from Texas Instruments (“TI”) related to the termination of the Company’s distribution agreement, the Company may experience lower sales and gross profit in the future if the impact of the termination is not offset by sales growth, gross margin improvements or operating cost reductions from strategic initiatives designed to mitigate such impacts. Sales from TI products represented approximately 10% of total sales in fiscal 2019.

​

Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margins

​

Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $543.8 million, a decrease of $92.9 million, or 14.6%, from the first quarter of fiscal 2019 gross profit of $636.8 million driven primarily by the decline in sales. Gross profit margin decreased 76 basis points to 11.7% from the first quarter of fiscal 2019 gross profit margin of 12.5% driven by declines in gross profit margin in both operating segments, most predominately in the Company’s Farnell segment. The declines in gross profit margin in both operating groups are primarily due to a combination of product and customer mix, geographical market mix and overall declines in gross profit margin due to current market conditions.

​

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

​


​


​

Restructuring, Integration and Other Expenses

​

As a result of management’s focus on improving operating efficiencies and further integrating the acquisition of Farnell, the Company has incurred certain restructuring costs. These costs also related to the continued transformation of the Company’s information technology, distribution center footprint and business operations including the re-prioritization of its information technology initiatives and resources. In addition, the Company incurred integration, accelerated depreciation and other costs. Integration costs are primarily related to the integration of acquired businesses including Farnell, the integration of certain regional and global businesses, and incremental costs incurred as part of the consolidation, relocation, sale and closure of distribution centers and office facilities. Accelerated depreciation relates to the incremental depreciation expense incurred related to the shortening of the estimated useful life for certain information technology assets. Other costs consist primarily of any other miscellaneous costs that relate to restructuring, integration and other expenses including acquisition related costs.

​

The Company recorded restructuring, integration and other expenses of $24.6 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company recorded $18.3 million of restructuring costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, which are expected to provide approximately $20.0 million in annual operating expense savings once such restructuring actions are completed. Included in the restructuring costs was severance costs of $11.6 million and a $6.7 million non-cash impairment expense related to information technology software. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company also incurred integration costs of $1.7 million, accelerated depreciation expense of $2.7 million, other costs of $2.1 million and a reversal of $0.2 million for changes in estimates for costs associated with prior year restructuring actions. The after-tax impact of restructuring, integration and other expenses were $18.4 million and $0.18 per share on a diluted basis.

​

Comparatively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, restructuring, integration and other expenses were $14.8 million. The after-tax impact of restructuring, integration, and other expenses was $11.5 million and $0.10 per share on a diluted basis. 

​

See Note 14 “Restructuring expenses” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

​

Operating Income

​

EC operating income margin decreased 83 basis points year over year to 2.6% and Farnell operating income margin decreased 427 basis points year over year to 6.5%. 

​

Interest and Other Financing Expenses, Net and Other Income (Expense), Net

​

Interest and other financing expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $33.6 million, an increase of $3.5 million or 11.8%, as compared with interest and other financing expenses of $30.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in interest and other financing expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily related to increased expenses in foreign regions to finance working capital needs.

​

During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company had $4.9 million of other income as compared with $1.9 million of other expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in other income was primarily due to favorable foreign currency gains in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to foreign currency losses in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

​

​

Income Tax Expense

​

The Company’s effective tax rate on its income from continuing operations before taxes was (22.7)% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared with 27.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company’s effective tax rate was favorably impacted primarily by (i) the release of unrecognized tax benefit reserves and (ii) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company’s effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) an adjustment to the provisional estimate for the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability recorded under the requirements of recent tax law changes in the United States (the “Act”) and (ii) increases in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by (iii) an adjustment to the provisional deferred tax impacts of the Act and (iv) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.

Outstanding borrowings under such forms of debt at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $0.6 million.

​

As an alternative form of financing outside of the United States, the Company sells certain of its trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements. The Company accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables are recorded within “Interest and other financing expenses, net” and were not material.

​

Liquidity

​

The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $664.1 million as of September 28, 2019, of which $592.6 million was held outside the United States. As of June 29, 2019, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $546.1 million, of which $476.6 million was held outside of the United States.

​

As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company had a combined total borrowing capacity of $1.75 billion under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program. There were no borrowings outstanding and $4.2 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility and $338.1 million in borrowings outstanding under the Securitization Program, resulting in approximately $1.41 billion of total availability as of September 28, 2019. Availability under the Securitization Program is subject to the Company having sufficient eligible trade accounts receivable to support desired borrowings. The Company expects to renew or replace the Securitization Program on similar terms, subject to market conditions, before its maturity in August 2020. The Company expects to redeem the $300.0 million of Notes due June 2020 either through the issuance of new notes or from available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $50.6 million under the Credit Facility and approximately $488.4 million under the Securitization Program. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $65.0 million under the Securitization Program.

​

During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities. Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth. The Company generated $871.7 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended September 28, 2019 from continuing operations. 

​

Liquidity is subject to many factors, such as normal business operations as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors that are beyond the Company’s control. To the extent the cash balances held in foreign locations cannot be remitted back to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner, those cash balances are generally used for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure needs and to support acquisitions. In addition, local government regulations may restrict the Company’s ability to move funds among various locations under certain circumstances. Management does not believe such restrictions would limit the Company’s ability to pursue its intended business strategy. Management believes that Avnet’s available borrowing capacity including capacity for the non-recourse sale of accounts receivable and the Company’s expected ability to generate operating cash flows in the future will be sufficient to meet its future liquidity needs. The Company also may issue debt or equity securities in the future and management believes the Company will have adequate access to the capital markets, if needed.

​

Historically the Company has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic investments through acquisition activity to the extent the investments strengthen Avnet’s competitive position, further its business strategies and meet management’s return on financial thresholds. As the Company implements the operating cost savings restructuring plans, responds to current business environment challenges and pursues ways to become more efficient and cost effective, the Company expects to use cash for restructuring, integration and other expenses.

​

In addition to continuing to make investments in acquisitions, as of September 28, 2019, the Company may repurchase up to an aggregate of $593.3 million of shares of the Company’s common stock through a $2.95 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors. The Company may repurchase stock from time to time at the discretion of management, subject to strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors. The Company may terminate or limit the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors such as share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and prevailing market conditions. Additionally, the Company currently expects to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of its common stock, subject to approval of the Board of Directors. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.21 per share, which resulted in $21.5 million of dividend payments during the quarter.

​

Item 3.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

​

The Company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements that are intended to provide an economic hedge against all or a portion of the risks associated with such volatility. The Company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not economically hedged.

​

See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2019, for further discussion of market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Avnet’s exposure to such risks has not changed materially since June 29, 2019, as the Company continues to economically hedge the majority of its foreign currency exchange exposures. Thus, any increase or decrease in fair value of the Company’s forward foreign currency exchange contracts is generally offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged position. For interest rate risk, the Company continues to maintain a combination of fixed and variable rate debt to mitigate the exposure to fluctuation in market interest rates. 

​

See Liquidity and Capital Resources — Financing Transactions appearing in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the Company’s financing transactions and capital structure. As of September 28, 2019, 82% of the Company’s debt bears interest at a fixed rate and 18% of the Company’s debt bears interest at variable rates. Therefore, a hypothetical 1.0% (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would result in a $0.8 million decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2020.

​

Item 4.

Controls and Procedures

​

The Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the reporting period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective such that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

​

During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, there were no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
