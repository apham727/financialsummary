Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements




The condensed consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2018 and for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017 include, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications) necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, statements of comprehensive income, statement of stockholders' equity, and statements of cash flows of Motorola Solutions, Inc. (“Motorola Solutions” or the “Company”) for all periods presented.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recent Developments

 On March 28, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Avigilon Corporation ("Avigilon"), a provider of advanced end-to-end security and surveillance solutions including video analytics, network video management hardware and software, surveillance cameras and access control solutions for a purchase price of $974 million.

On March 7, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Plant Holdings, Inc.("Plant"), the parent company of Airbus DS Communications for a purchase price of $237 million. This acquisition expands our software portfolio in the Command Center with additional solutions for Next Generation 9-1-1. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The ASU is effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The ASU prescribes the use of a modified retrospective method upon adoption, which requires all prior periods presented in the financial statements to be restated, with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. The Company has begun to assess the impact of the ASU on its financial statements and expects a material impact to its balance sheet through the recording of right-of-use assets and lease obligations that were not required to be recorded within the balance sheet under current accounting standards. The Company has also begun to catalog its existing lease contracts and identify changes needed to systems and processes.


Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements


The Company adopted ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective method of adoption. The amendments in the ASU require that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic cost (benefit) and report that component in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. The other components of net periodic cost (benefit) are required to be 


presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and outside of operating earnings. The Company has restated its comparative period results to reflect the application of the presentation guidance of the ASU. As a result of the ASU, the presentation of net periodic cost (benefit) has been updated to classify all components of the Company’s net periodic benefit, with the exception of the service cost component, within Other in Other income (expense) on the statement of operations. The Company reclassified $20 million and $3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017, respectively.

The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", and all the related amendments (collectively “ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to its opening retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect in those periods. 


Under the new standard, the Company identified distinct promises to transfer goods and services within its contracts. For system contracts that are recognized under percentage of completion accounting, the Company has considered the factors used to determine whether promises made in the contract are distinct and determined that devices and accessories represent distinct goods. Accordingly, adoption of the new standard impacts the Company's system contracts, with the result being revenue recognized earlier as control of devices and accessories transfers to the customer at a point in time rather than over time. For the remaining promised goods and services within the Company's system contracts, it continues to recognize revenue on these contracts using a cost-to-cost method based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer over time. 

Under the new standard, revenue recognition for software sales is accelerated based on when control of software licenses and related support services are transferred to the customer. Amounts deferred under previous software accounting rules due to lack of vendor-specific objective evidence have been recognized as an adjustment through opening retained earnings.

 Historically, the Company presented transactions that involved a third-party sales representative on a net basis. After considering the control concept and the remaining three indicators of gross presentation under the new standard, the Company has determined that it is the principal in contracts that involve a third-party sales representative. Thus, under the new standard, the Company presents associated revenues on a gross basis, with the affect being an equal increase to selling, general and administrative expenses for its cost of third-party commissions.

Under prior accounting standards, the Company expensed sales commissions and other costs to obtain a contract as incurred. However, under the new standard, the Company capitalizes sales commissions and certain other costs as incremental costs to obtain a contract. Such costs are classified as a non-current contract cost assets within Other assets and amortized over a period that approximates the timing of revenue recognition on the underlying contracts.

The new standard clarified the definition of a receivable and requires the Company to present its net position in a contract with a customer on the balance sheet. The position is presented as either a receivable, contract asset, or a contract liability. Under the new definition, accounts receivable are unconditional rights to consideration from a customer. Contract assets represent rights to consideration from a customer in exchange for transferred goods and services that are conditional on events other than the passage of time. Contract liabilities represent obligations to transfer goods and services for which the Company has received, or is due, consideration from a customer respectively. The Company reclassified its customer positions to align with the new definitions and presentation guidance. Accordingly, Unbilled accounts receivable and Costs and earnings in excess of billings have been reclassified from Accounts receivable and Other current assets, respectively, and are presented as Contract assets. Accounts receivable which are not due from customers have been reclassified into Other current assets. Deferred revenue, Billings in excess of costs and earnings, and Customer downpayments have been reclassified from Accrued liabilities and are presented as Contract liabilities. Non-current deferred revenue has been reclassified from Deferred revenue to Non-current contract liabilities within Other liabilities.

There is no impact to the Statement of comprehensive income or the Statement of cash flows, with the exception of changes to Net earnings and changes within assets and liabilities as presented on the balance sheet and disclosed above. 


2. Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The Company adopted ASC 606 and all the related amendments on January 1, 2018, applying the modified retrospective method to all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. The cumulative effect of adopting ASC 606 for contracts that were open as of the date of adoption is recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. All of the periods prior to the adoption of ASC 606 will continue to reflect the financial results recognized under the guidance of the previous revenue recognition standard. 








Disaggregation of Revenue





Systems also includes Avigilon end-to-end security and surveillance solutions including video analytics, network video management hardware and software, and access control solutions, which are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. Avigilon security and surveillance video solutions are traditionally sold through reseller partners, with contracts negotiated under fixed pricing. Provisions for returns are determined on a portfolio basis using historical data. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of the end-to-end video solution to the reseller partners, typically upon shipment. 






Significant Judgments 


The Company accounts for certain system contracts on an over time basis, electing an input method of estimated costs as a measure of performance completed. The selection of the measurement of progress using estimated costs was based on a thorough consideration of alternatives of various output and input measures, including contract milestones and labor hours. However, the Company has determined that other input and output measures are not an appropriate measure of progress as they do not accurately align with the transfer of control on its customized product solutions. The selection of costs incurred as a measure of progress aligns the transfer of control to the overall production of the customized system.

For system contracts accounted for over time using estimated costs as a measure of performance completed, the Company relies on estimates around the total estimated costs to complete the contract (“Estimated Costs at Completion”). Total Estimated Costs at Completion include direct labor, material and subcontracting costs. Due to the nature of the efforts required to be performed to meet the underlying performance obligation, determining Estimated Costs at Completion may be complex and subject to many variables. We have a standard and disciplined quarterly process in which management reviews the progress and performance of open contracts in order to determine the best estimate of Estimated Costs at Completion. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion, the project schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of costs. The risks and opportunities include management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the project schedule, technical requirements, and other contract requirements. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, and performance by subcontractors, among other variables. Based on this analysis, any quarterly adjustment to net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating income are recorded as necessary in the period they become known. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.


Remaining Performance Obligations 


Contract Balances


Contract assets consist of amounts formerly classified as Revenue in excess of billings and Unbilled accounts receivable where the Company does not yet have an unconditional right to bill. Contract liabilities consist of amounts formerly classified Billings in excess of revenue recognized, Customer downpayments and Deferred revenue.


Revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2018 which was previously included in Contract liabilities as of January 1, 2018 is $297 million. Revenue of $9 million was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2018 related to performance obligations satisfied, or partially satisfied, in previous periods, primarily driven by changes in the estimates of progress on system contracts. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company added Accounts receivable of $87 million, Contract assets of $26 million, and Contract liabilities of $48 million related to acquisitions.

There have been no impairment losses recognized on customer receivables or contract assets during the three months ended March 31, 2018.

Contract Cost Balances


Contract cost assets represent incremental costs to obtain a contract, primarily related to the Company's sales incentive plans, and certain costs to fulfill contracts. Contract cost assets are amortized into expense over a period that follows the passage of control to the customer over time. Incremental costs to obtain a contract with the Company's sales incentive plans are accounted for under a portfolio approach, with amortization ranging from one to four years to approximate the recognition of revenues over time. Where incremental costs to obtain a contract will be recognized in one year or less, the Company applies a practical expedient around expensing amounts as incurred. Amortization of contract cost assets was $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.

Other Income (Expense)



During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recognized a foreign currency loss of $11 million, primarily driven by the Euro and British pound, and a loss of $4 million on derivative instruments put in place to minimize the foreign exchange risk related to currency fluctuations, which includes a loss of $14 million on foreign currency derivatives put in place to minimize the exposure to the Canadian dollar related to the purchase of Avigilon.

During the three months ended April 1, 2017, the Company recognized a foreign currency loss of $2 million, primarily driven by the Euro and a loss of $7 million on derivative instruments put in place to minimize the foreign exchange risk related to currency fluctuations.


Earnings Per Common Share



In the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2018, the assumed exercise of 1.5 million options, including 1.2 million subject to market-based contingent stock agreements, were excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. For the three months ended April 1, 2017, the assumed exercise of 2.7 million options, including 2.3 million subject to market-based contingent stock agreements, were excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. 

On August 25, 2015, the Company issued $1.0 billion of 2% Senior Convertible Notes which mature in September 2020 (the "Senior Convertible Notes"). The notes became fully convertible as of August 25, 2017. In the event of conversion, the Company intends to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash. Since the Company’s intention is to settle the par value of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash upon conversion, only the number of shares that would be issuable (under the treasury stock method of accounting for share dilution) are included in our computation of diluted earnings per share. The conversion price is adjusted for dividends declared through the date of settlement. Diluted earnings per share has been calculated based upon the amount by which the average stock price exceeds the conversion price.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss




4. Debt and Credit Facilities

As of March 31, 2018, the Company had a $2.2 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in April 2022 (the "2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement"), of which $400 million was borrowed as of March 31, 2018 to facilitate the Avigilon acquisition. The 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a $500 million letter of credit sub-limit with $450 million of fronting commitments. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), at the Company's option. The weighted average borrowing rate on outstanding amounts was 3.25%. An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the Company's credit rating changes. The Company must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants as of March 31, 2018. 

To complete the acquisition of Avigilon during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company entered into a term loan for $400 million and a maturity date of March 26, 2021 (the “Term Loan”). Interest on the Term Loan is variable and indexed to LIBOR. Interest is payable quarterly. The weighted average borrowing rate for amounts outstanding during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 3.54%. Net proceeds after issuance costs were $399 million. No additional borrowings are permitted and amounts borrowed and repaid or prepaid may not be re-borrowed.

In February of 2018, the Company issued $500 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2028. The Company recognized net proceeds of $497 million after debt issuance costs and debt discounts. These proceeds were then used to make a $500 million contribution to the Company's U.S. pension plan.

On August 25, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Silver Lake Partners to issue $1.0 billion of 2.00% Senior Convertible Notes which mature in September 2020. The notes became fully convertible as of August 25, 2017. The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 14.7476, as may be adjusted for dividends declared, per $1,000 principal amount (which is currently equal to a conversion price of $67.81 per share). The exercise price adjusts automatically for dividends. The value by which the Senior Convertible Notes exceeded their principal amount if converted as of March 31, 2018 was $590 million. In the event of conversion, the Company intends to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash.


Foreign Currency Risk

As of March 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $643 million, compared to $507 million outstanding at December 31, 2017. The Company does not believe these financial instruments should subject it to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should generally offset gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions.



As of the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company had entered into forward contracts to sell £25 million, expiring in June 2018, as well as to sell £25 million, expiring in September 2018. The forward contracts have been designated as a net investment hedge which is in place to partially hedge the Company's British pound foreign currency exposure on its net investment in Airwave Solutions Limited. The gains and losses on the Company's net investment in British pound-denominated foreign operations, driven by changes in foreign exchange rates, are economically offset by movements in the fair values of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges. Any changes in fair value of the net investment hedges are reflected as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. As of March 31, 2018, the fair value of the derivative contracts was a $7 million liability.

Interest Rate Risk

Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have variable interest loans denominated in the Euro and Chilean Peso. The Company has interest rate swap agreements in place which change the characteristics of interest rate payments from variable to maximum fixed-rate payments. The interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges. As such, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in Other income (expense) in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was de minimus at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.


Counterparty Risk

The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to counterparty credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments when the derivative is in an asset position. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk. As of March 31, 2018, all of the counterparties have investment grade credit ratings. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $4 million of exposure to aggregate net credit risk with all counterparties.










At the end of each interim reporting period, the Company makes an estimate of its annual effective income tax rate. Tax expense in interim periods is calculated at the estimated annual effective tax rate plus or minus the tax effects of items of income and expense that are discrete to the period. The estimate used in providing for income taxes on a year-to-date basis may change in subsequent interim periods.



The Company recorded $23 million of net tax expense during the three months ended March 31, 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate of 16%, compared to $42 million of net tax expense during the three months ended April 1, 2017, resulting in an effective tax rate of 35%. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of 16% is lower than the effective tax rate for the three months ended April 1, 2017 of 35%, primarily due to the corporate income tax rate decrease from 35% to 21%, as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) enacted December 22, 2017. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily driven by a tax benefit due to the recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2017 was equal to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%. 

Under the guidance in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 that addresses the FASB's ASC Topic 740, "Income Taxes," the Company recorded provisional amounts for the impact of the Tax Act in 2017. The Company is continuing to analyze the impact of the recently issued IRS Notices. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company has not recorded any material adjustments to the previously recorded tax impact.

7. Retirement and Other Employee Benefits

Pension and Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plans 



The Company made a $500 million contribution to its U.S. Pension Plans during the three months ended March 31, 2018.


8. Share-Based Compensation Plans



During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company granted 0.3 million RSUs and 0.1 million market stock units ("MSUs") with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $36 million and $7 million, respectively, and 0.2 million stock options and 0.2 million performance options ("POs") with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $5 million and $7 million, respectively. Share-based compensation expense will generally be recognized over the vesting period of three years.

9. Fair Value Measurements

The Company holds or has held certain fixed income securities, equity securities and derivatives, which are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. Fair value is measured using the fair value hierarchy and related valuation methodologies as defined in the authoritative literature. This guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to each measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's assumptions about current market conditions. 


Level 1—Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

Level 2—Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations, in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.

Level 3—Valuations derived from valuation techniques, in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable. 





The Company had no Level 3 holdings as of March 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017.

At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had $306 million and $633 million, respectively, of investments in money market prime and government funds (Level 1) classified as Cash and cash equivalents in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. The money market funds had quoted market prices that are equivalent to par.

Using quoted market prices and market interest rates, the Company determined that the fair value of long-term debt at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $5.9 billion and $4.6 billion (Level 2), respectively. 

All other financial instruments are carried at cost, which is not materially different from the instruments’ fair values.

10. Long-term Financing and Sales of Receivables

Long-term Financing



The current portion of long-term receivables is included in Accounts receivable, net and the non-current portion of long-term receivables is included in Other assets in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company had outstanding commitments to provide long-term financing to third parties totaling $74 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $93 million at December 31, 2017. 

Sales of Receivables



At March 31, 2018, the Company had retained servicing obligations for $848 million of long-term receivables, compared to $873 million at December 31, 2017. Servicing obligations are limited to collection activities related to the sales of accounts receivables and long-term receivables. 


Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses




11. Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Matters

The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits, claims, and actions, which arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. However, an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations in the periods in which the matters are ultimately resolved, or in the periods in which more information is obtained that changes management's opinion of the ultimate disposition.

Other Indemnifications

The Company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it is obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. In indemnification cases, payment by the Company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow the Company to challenge the other party's claims. In some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the Company.

Some of these obligations arise as a result of divestitures of the Company's assets or businesses and require the Company to indemnify the other party against losses arising from breaches of representations and warranties and covenants and, in some cases, the settlement of pending obligations. The Company's obligations under divestiture agreements for indemnification based on breaches of representations and warranties are generally limited in terms of duration and to amounts not in excess of a percentage of the contract value. The Company had no accruals for any such obligations at March 31, 2018.

In addition, the Company may provide indemnifications for losses that result from the breach of general warranties contained in certain commercial and intellectual property agreements. Historically, the Company has not made significant payments under these agreements.






More advanced offerings include network monitoring, software maintenance and cyber security services. Managed services offerings range from partial or full operation of customer owned networks to operation of Motorola Solutions owned networks. Services are provided across all radio network technologies, Command Center Consoles and Smart Public Safety Solutions.





13. Reorganization of Business


During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of $13 million including $8 million of charges in Other charges and $5 million of charges in Cost of sales in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the $13 million were charges of $22 million related to employee separation costs and $2 million related to exit costs, partially offset by $11 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.






Exit Costs

At January 1, 2018, the Company had $9 million of accruals for exit costs. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, there were $2 million of additional charges and $2 million of cash payments related to the exit of leased facilities. The remaining accrual of $9 million, which is included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2018, primarily represents future cash payments for lease obligations that are expected to be paid over a number of years.

Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2018, the Company had an accrual of $41 million for employee separation costs. The 2018 additional charges of $22 million represent severance costs for approximately 300 employees. The adjustment of $11 million reflects reversals for accruals no longer needed. The $13 million used reflects cash payments to severed employees. The remaining accrual of $39 million, which is included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2018, is expected to be paid, primarily within one year, to approximately 400 employees, who have either been severed or have been notified of their severance and have begun or will begin receiving payments.


During the three months ended April 1, 2017, the Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of $19 million including $15 million of charges in Other charges and $4 million of charges in Cost of sales in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the $19 million were charges of $15 million related to employee separation costs and $4 million for exit costs.




14. Intangible Assets and Goodwill

The Company accounts for acquisitions using purchase accounting with the results of operations for each acquiree included in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements for the period subsequent to the date of acquisition.

Avigilon Corporation

 On March 28, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Avigilon Corporation, a provider of advanced end-to-end security and surveillance solutions including video analytics, network video management hardware and software, surveillance cameras and access control solutions. The purchase price of $974 million, consisted of cash payments of $980 million for outstanding common stock, restricted stock units and employee held stock options, net of cash acquired of $107 million, debt assumed of $75 million and transaction costs of $26 million. Prior to the end of the first quarter, $35 million of the assumed debt was repaid and subsequent to the quarter, the remaining $40 million was repaid.



Acquired intangible assets consist of $120 million of customer relationships, $380 million of developed technology and $8 million of trade names and will have useful lives of two to 20 years. The preliminary fair values of all intangible assets were estimated using the income approach. Customer relationships and developed technology were valued under the excess earnings method which assumes that the value of an intangible asset is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable specifically to the intangible asset. Trade names were valued under the relief from royalty method, which assumes value to the extent that the acquired company is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them.

 Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

The pro forma effect of this acquisition is not significant.

Other Acquisitions

On March 7, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Plant Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Airbus DS Communications for a purchase price of $237 million net cash. This acquisition will expand the Company's software portfolio in the Command Center with additional solutions for Next Generation 9-1-1. The Company recognized $157 million of goodwill, $77 million of identifiable intangible assets and $3 million of net assets acquired. The identifiable intangible assets were classified as $40 million of customer-related intangibles, $26 million of completed technology and $11 million of trade names. The identifiable intangible assets will be amortized over a period of 10 to 20 years. The purchase accounting is not yet complete and as such the final allocation between identifiable intangibles and goodwill may be subject to change.

On August 28, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, a provider of broadband push-to-talk (PTT) for commercial customers, for a gross purchase price of $225 million. As a result of the acquisition, the Company recognized $191 million of goodwill, $44 million of identifiable intangible assets and $10 million of acquired liabilities. The identifiable intangible assets were classified as $25 million of customer-related intangibles and $19 million of completed technology and will be amortized over a period of 13 to 16 years. 



The pro forma effects of these acquisitions are not significant.

Intangible Assets



Amortization expense on intangible assets was $41 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and $36 million for the three months ended April 1, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, annual amortization expense is estimated to be $202 million in 2018, $214 million in 2019, $209 million in 2020, $207 million in 2021, $204 million in 2022, and $96 million in 2023.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This commentary should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto of Motorola Solutions, Inc. (“Motorola Solutions” or the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017, as well as our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Executive Overview

Recent Developments

On March 28, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Avigilon Corporation, a provider of advanced end-to-end security and surveillance solutions including video analytics, network video management hardware and software, surveillance cameras and access control solutions for a purchase price of $974 million.

On March 7, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Plant Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Airbus DS Communications for a purchase price of $237 million. This acquisition expands our software portfolio in the Command Center with additional solutions for Next Generation 9-1-1. 

We adopted ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", and all the related amendments (collectively “ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to our opening retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect in those periods. The impact from adoption increased Net sales by $15 million.

Our Business

We are a leading global provider of mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software, and services. Our products and services help government, public safety and commercial customers improve their operations through increased effectiveness, efficiency, and safety of their mobile workforces.

Results of Operations




Results of Operations—Three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to three months ended April 1, 2017 

The results of operations for the first quarter of 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. Historically, we have experienced higher revenues in the fourth quarter as compared to the rest of the quarters of our fiscal year as a result of the purchasing patterns of our customers.

Net Sales


Gross Margin 

Gross margin was $669 million, or 45.6% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $570 million, or 44.5% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by a favorable mix in the Products segment. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses


Research and Development Expenditures


Other Charges



Net Interest Expense

Net interest expense was $46 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $51 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in net interest expense in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 was a result of higher interest income due to amounts associated with a tax refund received within the first quarter of 2018.

Gains (losses) on Sales of Investments and Businesses, net

Net gains on sales of investments and businesses were $11 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net gains of $3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The net gains in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 were related to sales of various equity investments.

Other



Effective Tax Rate

We recorded $23 million of net tax expense in the first quarter of 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate of 16%, compared to $42 million of net tax expense in the first quarter of 2017, resulting in an effective tax rate of 35%. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of 16% is lower than our effective tax rate for the three months ended April 1, 2017 of 35%, primarily due to the corporate income tax rate decrease from 35% to 21%, as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) enacted December 22, 2017. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily driven by a tax benefit due to the recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2017 was equal to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%. 

Net Earnings Attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc.

After taxes, we had net earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. of $117 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to net earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. of $77 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.


Segment Information

The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each reporting segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017, as detailed in Note 12, “Segment Information,” of our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Products Segment

For both the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, the segment’s net sales represented 55% of our consolidated net sales.


Three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to three months ended April 1, 2017 

The segment’s net sales increased $98 million, to $801 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $703 million during the first quarter of 2017. The increase in the segment's net sales was driven by an increase in both Systems and Devices sales. Devices net sales increased in the Americas and EMEA. Systems net sales increased in EMEA and AP. 

Net sales in the Americas continued to comprise a significant portion of the segment’s business, accounting for approximately 76% of the segment’s net sales in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 75% of the segment's net sales in the first quarter of 2017. 


Services Segment

For both the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, the segment’s net sales represented 45% of our consolidated net sales.



Three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to three months ended April 1, 2017 


Net sales in the Americas continued to comprise a significant portion of the segment’s business, accounting for approximately 59% of the segment’s net sales in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 58% of the segment’s net sales in the first quarter of 2017.


Reorganization of Business

During the first quarter of 2018, we recorded net reorganization of business charges of $13 million including $8 million of charges recorded within Other charges and $5 million in Cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the $13 million were charges of $22 million related to employee separation costs and $2 million related to exit costs, partially offset by $11 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.

During the first quarter of 2017, we recorded net reorganization of business charges of $19 million including $15 million of charges recorded within Other charges and $4 million in Cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Included in the $19 million were charges of $15 million related to employee separation costs and $4 million for exit costs.



Cash payments for employee severance and exit costs in connection with the reorganization of business plans were $15 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $30 million in the first quarter of 2017. The reorganization of business accruals at March 31, 2018 were $48 million, of which $39 million relate to employee separation costs that are expected to be paid within one year and $9 million of accruals related primarily to lease termination obligations that are expected to be paid over a number of years.

Liquidity and Capital Resources


Cash and Cash Equivalents

At March 31, 2018, $440 million of the $858 million cash and cash equivalents balance was held in the U.S. and approximately $418 million was held by us or our subsidiaries in other countries. Restricted cash was $63 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 

Operating Activities

Net cash used for operating activities in the first quarter of 2018 was $500 million, as compared to $142 million provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2017. Operating cash flows in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the first quarter of 2017, were negatively impacted by the $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan, higher incentive payments, higher tax payments and the recovery of financial receivables owed to us in the first quarter of 2017. The contribution to our U.S. pension plan moves the next anticipated required contribution to 2024, or beyond.


Investing Activities





Financing Activities



To complete the acquisition of Avigilon during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we entered into a term loan for $400 million and a maturity date of March 26, 2021 (the “Term Loan”). Interest on the Term Loan is variable and indexed to LIBOR. Interest is payable quarterly. The weighted average borrowing rate for amounts outstanding during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 3.54%. Net proceeds after issuance costs were $399 million. No additional borrowings are permitted and amounts borrowed and repaid or prepaid may not be re-borrowed. 

In February of 2018, we issued $500 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2028. After debt issuance costs and debt discounts, we recognized net proceeds of $497 million. These proceeds were then used to make a $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan.

On August 25, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Silver Lake Partners to issue $1.0 billion of 2.00% Senior Convertible Notes which mature in September 2020. The notes became fully convertible as of August 25, 2017. The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 14.7476, as may be adjusted for dividends declared, per $1,000 principal amount (which is currently equal to a conversion price of $67.81 per share). The exercise price adjusts automatically for dividends. In the event of conversion, the notes may be settled in either cash or stock, at our discretion. We intend to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash.

We have investment grade ratings on our senior unsecured long-term debt from the three largest U.S. national rating agencies. We continue to believe that we will be able to maintain sufficient access to the capital markets. Any future disruptions, uncertainty, or volatility in the capital markets, or deterioration in our credit ratings, may result in higher funding costs for us and adversely affect our ability to access funds.




Credit Facilities

As of March 31, 2018, we had a $2.2 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in April 2022 (the "2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement"), of which $400 million was borrowed as of March 31, 2018 to facilitate the Avigilon acquisition. The 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a $500 million letter of credit sub-limit with $450 million of fronting commitments. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), at our option. The weighted average borrowing rate on outstanding amounts was 3.25%. An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if our credit rating changes. We must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of March 31, 2018. 

Long-Term Customer Financing Commitments


Sales of Receivables



At March 31, 2018, the Company had retained servicing obligations for $848 million of long-term receivables, compared to $873 million at December 31, 2017. Servicing obligations are limited to collection activities related to the sales of accounts receivables and long-term receivables. 

Other Contingencies



Some of these obligations arise as a result of divestitures of our assets or businesses and require us to indemnify the other party against losses arising from breaches of representations and warranties and covenants and, in some cases, the settlement of pending obligations. Our obligations under divestiture agreements for indemnification based on breaches of representations and warranties are generally limited in terms of duration, and for amounts for breaches of such representations and warranties in connection with prior divestitures not in excess of a percentage of the contract value. We had no accruals for any such obligations at March 31, 2018.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2019 and interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The ASU prescribes the use of a modified retrospective method upon adoption, which requires all prior periods presented in the financial statements to be restated, with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. We have begun to assess the impact of the ASU on our financial statements and expect a material impact to our balance sheet through the recording of right-of-use assets and lease obligations that were not required to be recorded within the balance sheet under current accounting standards. We have also begun to catalog our existing lease contracts and identify changes needed to systems and processes.


Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements


We adopted ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective method of adoption. The amendments in the ASU require that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic cost (benefit) and report that component in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. The other components of net periodic cost (benefit) are required to be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component and outside of operating earnings. We have restated our comparative period results to reflect the application of the presentation guidance of the ASU. As a result of the ASU, the presentation of net periodic cost (benefit) has been updated to classify all components of our net periodic benefit, with the exception of the service cost component, within Other in Other income (expense) on the statement of operations. We reclassified $20 million and $3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017, respectively.

We adopted ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", and all the related amendments (collectively “ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to our opening retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect in those periods.



Under the new standard, revenue recognition for software sales is accelerated based on when control of software licenses and related support services are transferred to the customer. Amounts deferred under previous software accounting rules due to a lack of vendor-specific objective evidence have been recognized as an adjustment through opening retained earnings.

 Historically, we presented transactions that involved a third-party sales representative on a net basis. After considering the control concept and the remaining three indicators of gross presentation under the new standard, we have determined that we are the principal in contracts that involve a third-party sales representative. Thus, we present associated revenues on a gross 


basis, with the affect being an equal increase to selling, general and administrative expenses for our cost of third-party commissions.

Under prior accounting standards, we expensed sales commissions and other costs to obtain a contract as incurred. However, under the new standard, we capitalize sales commissions and certain other costs as incremental costs to obtain a contract. Such costs are classified as a non-current contract cost assets within Other assets and amortized over a period that approximates the timing of revenue recognition on the underlying contracts.

The new standard clarified the definition of a receivable and requires us to present our net position in a contract with a customer on the balance sheet. The position is presented as either a receivable, contract asset, or a contract liability. Under the new definition, accounts receivable are unconditional rights to consideration from a customer. Contract assets represent rights to consideration from a customer in exchange for transferred goods and services that are conditional on events other than the passage of time. Contract liabilities represent obligations to transfer goods and services for which we have received, or is due, consideration from a customer respectively. We reclassified our customer positions to align with the new definitions and presentation guidance. Accordingly, Unbilled accounts receivable and Costs and earnings in excess of billings have been reclassified from Accounts receivable and Other current assets, respectively, and are presented as Contract assets. Accounts receivable which are not due from customers have been reclassified into Other current assets. Deferred revenue, Billings in excess of costs and earnings, and Customer downpayments have been reclassified from Accrued liabilities and are presented as Contract liabilities. Non-current deferred revenue has been reclassified from Deferred revenue to Non-current contract liabilities within Other liabilities.


Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Derivative Financial Instruments

As of March 31, 2018, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $643 million, compared to $507 million outstanding as of December 31, 2017. Management believes that these financial instruments should not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should generally offset gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions.

We have made appropriate changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as we have implemented the new system. We plan to continue to migrate the remaining parts of the business off regional systems as we work towards a single global platform. We will continue to modify our internal controls in response to changes in the underlying ERP on future phases as needed.
