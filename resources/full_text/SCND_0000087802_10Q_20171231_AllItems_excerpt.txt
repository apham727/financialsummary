  1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

  Principles of Consolidation 

 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Scientific Industries, Inc., Altamira Instruments, Inc. (“Altamira”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary, Scientific Bioprocessing, Inc. (“SBI”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary, and Scientific Packaging Industries, Inc., an inactive wholly-owned subsidiary (all collectively referred to as the “Company”). All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 


 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842). The FASB issued this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the new standard. 



 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”. This update provides guidance on how to record eight specific cash flow issues. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and a retrospective transition method to each period should be presented. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this update on its consolidated financial statements. 

 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)”, requiring that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective approach which requires application of the guidance for all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard and does not expect the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 


  Adopted Accounting Pronoucements 


 On December 22, 2017, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, “Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or SAB 118,” which addresses situations where the accounting under the FASB, Accounting Standards Codification No. 740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740 is incomplete for certain income tax effects of Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the 2017 Tax Act, by the time an entity issues its financial statements for the fiscal period that includes the date the 2017 Tax Act was enacted. 

 Under ASC 740, entities are required to adjust current and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the effects of changes in tax laws or rates at their date of enactment. However, pursuant to SAB 118, if an entity does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act at the time an entity’s financial statements are issued, an entity shall apply ASC 740 based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act. If the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act is incomplete, but an entity can determine a reasonable estimate for those effects, an entity can record provisional amounts during a measurement period, which ends on the earlier of when an entity has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information necessary to complete the accounting requirements of ASC 740 and December 22, 2017. 

 The 2017 Tax Act includes significant changes to the U.S. income tax system. The 2017 Tax Act contains numerous provisions impacting the Company, the most significant of which reduces the Federal corporate statutory rate from 35% to 21%. The Company is a fiscal-year end taxpayer and is required to use a blended statutory federal tax rate, inclusive of the Federal rate change enacted on December 22, 2017 to compute its effective rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017. The various provisions under the 2017 Tax Act most relevant to the Company have been considered in the preparation of the financial statements as of December 31, 2017. However, as of December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of 2017 Tax act. The Company’s provision for income taxes for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 is based on reasonable estimates of the effects of its implementation and existing deferred tax balances. The Company estimates it will record a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $30,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 due to an estimated reduction in deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the Federal tax rate. We expect to complete our accounting during the one year measurement period from the enactment date. 

  2. Segment Information and Concentrations 






 Approximately 31% and 55% of net benchtop laboratory equipment sales (48% and 30% of total revenues) for the three month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories. 

 Approximately 12% and 21% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (19% and 11% of total revenues) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

 For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, two customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 10% and 17% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (15% and 9% of the Company’s total revenues). Sales of catalyst research instruments generally comprise a few very large orders averaging approximately $50,000 per order to a limited number of customers, who differ from order to order. Sales to one and three customers during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, accounted for approximately 74% and 99% of the Catalyst Research Instrument Operations’ revenues and 7% and 44% of the Company’s total revenues, respectively. 




 Approximately 36% and 52% of net benchtop laboratory equipment sales (46% and 36% of total revenues) for the six month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories. 

 Approximately 16% and 23% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (21% and 16% of total revenues) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, two customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 11% and 16% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (15% and 11% of the Company’s total revenues). 

 Sales of catalyst research instruments generally comprise a few very large orders averaging approximately $50,000 per order to a limited number of customers, who differ from order to order. Sales to one and six customers during the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, accounted for approximately 64% and 97% of the Catalyst Research Instrument Operations’ revenues and 4% and 29% of the Company’s total revenues, respectively. 

  3. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. 



 Level 1 - Inputs that are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 

 Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 

 Level 3 - Prices or valuation that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

 In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company calculated the fair value of its Level 1 and 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments. These calculations take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and its counterparties. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. 

 The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria. The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the following tables. 











 Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value, and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. The estimate is based on managements review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. Cost of work-in-process and finished goods inventories include material, labor, and manufacturing overhead. 


  5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with the Company’s acquisitions. Goodwill amounted to $705,300 at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 





 Total amortization expense was $61,100 and $76,200 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively and $122,200 and $154,100 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets is $124,700 for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, $185,800 for fiscal 2019, $65,400 for fiscal 2020, $48,000 for fiscal 2021, $27,000 for fiscal 2022, and $7,400 thereafter. 

  6. Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share 



 Approximately 82,000 and 43,500 shares of the Company's common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, because the effect would be anti-dilutive. 


 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

  Forward-Looking statements. Certain statements contained in this report are not based on historical facts, but are forward-looking statements that are based upon various assumptions about future conditions. Actual events in the future could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking information. Numerous unknown factors and future events could cause such differences, including but not limited to, product demand, market acceptance, success of marketing strategy, success of expansion efforts, impact of competition, adverse economic conditions, and other factors affecting the Company’s business that are beyond the Company’s control, which are discussed elsewhere in this report. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. 

 Overview. The Company reflected income before income tax expense of $16,400 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $64,800 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to lack of sales of catalyst research instruments during the period and product development expenses for a new automated pill counter for the Laboratory Equipment Operations. The Company reflected a loss before income tax benefit of $290,100 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4,700 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 mainly due to decreased catalyst research instrument sales and product development costs as previously discussed. The results reflected total non-cash amounts for depreciation and amortization of $77,000 and $154,100 for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2017 compared to $93,800 and $189,500 for the corresponding three and six month periods in 2016. 

  Results of Operations. 

  The Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with The Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 

 Net revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $791,400 (29.5%) to $1,892,400 from $2,683,800 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, reflecting a decrease of $1,038,600 in net sales of catalyst research instruments due to decreased orders from Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM customers and lack of large orders, partially offset by increased sales of benchtop laboratory equipment of $219,400 and bioprocessing royalties of $27,800. The benchtop laboratory equipment sales reflected $359,900 of Torbal brand product sales for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $303,500 in the three months ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the order backlog for catalyst research instruments was $752,500, all of which is expected to be shipped during fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, compared to $397,300 as of December 31, 2016. 

 The overall gross profit percentage for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 40.5% compared to 29.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The current year period gross margin for the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations was higher due to the effect of the allocation of fixed costs on higher sales. The catalyst research instruments was negatively impacted by the lower sales. 

 General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $407,900 compared to $409,200 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. 

 Selling expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $9,600 (4.3%) to $214,600 from $224,200 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, due to lower sales related expenses for the Catalyst Research Instruments Operations. 

 Research and development expenses increased by $27,900 (26.6%) to $132,900 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $105,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased new product development costs incurred by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations related to the Torbal Scales Division. 

 Total other income decreased by $2,200 (26.5%) from $8,300 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 to $6,100 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 due to lower interest on its investment securities. 

 The Company reflected an income tax expense of $97,400 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to income tax expense of $19,500 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a revision of the estimate of the Company's expected annual income.

 As a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded a net loss of $81,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to net income $45,300 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. 

  The Six Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with The Six Months Ended December 31, 2016 

 Net revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $1,069,600 (25.2%) to $3,173,300 from $4,242,900 for the six months ended December 31, 2016, reflecting a decrease of $1,087,300 in net sales of catalyst research instruments due to decreased orders from Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM customers and lack of large orders, and a decrease of $38,000 in sales of benchtop laboratory equipment derived from the Torbal Division, partially offset by a $55,700 increase in bioprocessing royalties. The benchtop laboratory equipment sales reflected $664,200 of Torbal brand product sales for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $685,500 in the six months ended December 31, 2016. 

 The overall gross profit percentage for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was 38.4% compared to 34.5% for the six months ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (which is sold at higher margins) consisting of a higher percentage of total sales for the year. 

 General and administrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 increased slightly by $14,700 (1.8%) to $836,300 compared to $821,600 for the six months ended December 31, 2016. 

 Selling expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $25,300 (5.7%) to $415,600 from $440,900 for the six months ended December 31, 2016, due to lower sales related expenses for the Catalyst Research Instruments Operations. 


 Research and development expenses increased by $41,600 (18.9%) to $262,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $220,400 for the six months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased new product development costs incurred by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations related to the Torbal Scales Division. 

 Total other income decreased by $7,300 (53.3%) from $13,700 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 to $6,400 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 due to lower interest on its investment securities and miscellaneous income items. 

 The Company reflected an income tax expense of $23,500 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of $1,300 for the six months ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the statutory federal tax rate change resulting from the recently enacted 2017 Tax Act, including a write off of deferred tax assets of $15,500.

 As a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded a net loss of $313,600 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $3,400 for the six months ended December 31, 2016. 

  Liquidity and Capital Resources. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $324,400 to $700,700 as of December 31, 2017 from $1,025,100 as of June 30, 2017 primarily due to decreased cash generated by the Catalyst Research Instrument Operations and increased inventories. 

  Net cash used in operating activities was $133,700 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $450,300 used during the six months ended December 31, 2016. The current period reflected higher accounts payable and customer advances, partially offset by increased prepaid expenses and higher inventories. Net cash used in investing activities was $84,600 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $27,000 used during the six months ended December 31, 2016 principally due to new capital equipment purchased during the current year period by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations. The Company used $106,100 in financing activities in the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to cash provided of $129,400 in the six months ended December 31, 2016 mainly due to decreased proceeds under the line of credit in the current year. 

  The Company's working capital decreased by $191,500 to $3,782,400 as of December 31, 2017 compared to $3,973,900, as of June 30, 2017 due to increased capital expenditures and a net loss incurred during the current period.

  The Company has a Demand Line of Credit through June 2018 with First National Bank of Pennsylvania which provides for borrowings of up to $300,000 for regular working capital needs, bearing interest at prime, currently 4.5%. Advances on the line, are secured by a pledge of the Company’s assets including inventory, accounts, chattel paper, equipment and general intangibles of the Company. As of December 31, 2017 $40,000 which was borrowed by our subsidiary, Altamira Instruments, was outstanding under such line. In addition, the Company utilized $245,400 of its borrowing availability under the line as collateral for a warranty standby letter of credit required during a two year warranty period as a condition of sale for a large order of catalyst research instruments shipped in a prior fiscal year and installed in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, leaving an available borrowing balance of $14,600 under the line of credit. 

  Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its cash flow needs during the 12 months ending June 30, 2018 from its available financial resources including its line of credit, its cash and investment securities, and operations. 


 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, based on an evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of the Company has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the applicable time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. The Company also concluded that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There was no change in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.
