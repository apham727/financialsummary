Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Overview of Business 

In 1989, we were formed and incorporated in California. We maintain a majority-owned subsidiary in Mexico (since 1998) and two divisions in each of Taiwan (since 1998) and China (since 2005). Our Mexico location closed all operations in May 2013 (final closure is pending sale of our local 15,000 sq. ft. office and warehouse facility) and our Taiwan and China locations are for supporting overseas customers, inventory sourcing, purchases and coordinating the manufacture of our products. Our China location also serves as the engineering designs support center responsible for arranging pre-production scheduling and mass production runs with joint venture partners for our projects, making component datasheets and test specifications, preparing samples, monitoring quality of shipments and performing failure analysis reports. 

Basis of Presentation 

The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all wholly owned divisions, including its 60% majority-owned subsidiary, Taitron Components Mexico, S.A. de C.V. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation of its financial condition and results of operations for the interim periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been included. Operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of financial results for the full year. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. In preparing these financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions included in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements relate to the allowance for sales returns, doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes. Certain amounts in the prior year condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new accounting standard on leasing. The new standard will require companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also proposes a dual model for recognizing expense. This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 with early adoption permitted. We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and we are preparing for the changes to be made to our consolidated financial statements. We expect the adoption of these accounting changes will not impact our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets. 

In January 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. This guidance will be effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2019 and interim reporting periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted for transactions that have not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. We are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. This guidance will be effective for the year ending December 31, 2019 and interim reporting periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted. We expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 


Index  

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

On January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09) applying the modified retrospective method. The primary impact of adoption relates to additional disclosures and presentation of revenue by primary geographical market, major product line and the timing of revenue recognition. 

Revenue recognition 

Revenue is recognized at the point at which control of the underlying products are transferred to the customer. Satisfaction of our performance obligations occur upon the transfer of control of products, either from our facilities or directly from suppliers to customers. We consider customer purchase orders to be the contracts with a customer. All revenue is generated from contracts with customers. 

In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to receive. 

Taxes assessed by a governmental authority on revenue-producing transactions are excluded from revenue. 

Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment costs and are included in cost of products sold. 

Based upon the nature of our contracts with customers and our performance obligations within those contracts, we have no contract assets or liabilities as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 

Nature of products 



ODM Components - Our private labeled electronic components. 

Distribution Components - Our name brand electronic components. 

Disaggregation of revenue 

In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by primary geographical market, major product line, and timing of revenue recognition. 



Index  


Inventory – Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) or net realizable value. We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,546,000 and $4,990,000 at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,946,000 and $7,848,000, respectively. We evaluate inventories to identify excess, high-cost, slow-moving or other factors rendering inventories as unmarketable at normal profit margins. Due to the complexity of managing and maintaining a large inventory of product offerings, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the cost of inventories. Based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions, inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. If our assumptions about future demand change, or market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs of inventories may be required. In any case, actual amounts could be different from those estimated. 

3 – OTHER ASSETS 


Our $193,000 investment in securities as of June 30, 2018 relates to our ownership of 1,322,552 common shares of Zowie Technology Corporation (New Taipei City, Taiwan), a supplier of electronic component products. Our investment relates to approximately 8.9% of their total outstanding shares although we do not have significant influence or control. This investment is accounted for under the cost method basis of accounting. 

Our $50,000 investment in joint venture as of June 30, 2018, relates to our 49% ownership of Grand Shine Management Limited (Dong Guan, China), an electronic device contract manufacturer, and joint venture with its 51% owner, Teamforce Company Limited. Our investment is accounted for under the equity method basis of accounting. As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we have recorded our 49% share of cumulative unrealized losses from the inception of our investment in Grand Shine Management of $1,126,000 and $991,000, respectively. 

4 – LONG-TERM DEBT FROM RELATED PARTY 

On April 21, 2008 we entered into a $3,000,000 credit facility, collateralized by real property, from K.S. Best International Co. Ltd., a company controlled by the brother of our Chief Executive Officer. Credit is available in $500,000 advances, each advance is payable in monthly interest only installments, at the rate of Prime + 0.25% per annum. As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the aggregate outstanding balance on this credit facility was $0 and $500,000, respectively. 

5 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

We made payments to K.S. Best International Co. Ltd., a company controlled by the brother of our Chief Executive Officer of approximately $6,000 for both of the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. These payments were for professional fees related to the operational management of our Taiwan office. In addition, we also made interest expense payments on our credit facility of approximately $3,000 and $11,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively and $9,000 and $21,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 4.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

This document contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements usually are denoted by words or phrases such as “believes,” “expects,” “projects,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “will likely result” or similar expressions. We wish to caution readers that all forward-looking statements are necessarily speculative and not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and to advise readers that actual results could vary due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. We do not undertake any duty to update forward-looking statements after the date they are made or to conform them to actual results or to changes in circumstances or expectations.  

References to “Taitron,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Taitron Components Incorporated and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise specifically defines. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Use of Estimates - Management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These estimates have a significant impact on our valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns, doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer. Reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns. Sales returns for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $1,000 and $36,000, respectively and for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were $3,000 and $148,000, respectively. The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 aggregated $43,000 and $40,000, respectively. 

Inventory – Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) or net realizable value. We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,546,000 and $4,990,000 at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,946,000 and $7,848,000, respectively. We evaluate inventories to identify excess, high-cost, slow-moving or other factors rendering inventories as unmarketable at normal profit margins. Due to the complexity of managing and maintaining a large inventory of product offerings, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the cost of inventories. Based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions, inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. If our assumptions about future demand change, or market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs of inventories may be required. In any case, actual amounts could be different from those estimated. 

Overview 

We are primarily focused on supplying ODM products for our OEM customer’s multi-year turn-key projects. We also distribute discrete semiconductors, commodity Integrated Circuits (ICs), optoelectronic devices and passive components to other electronic distributors, CEMs and OEMs, who incorporate them in their products. 

Our core strategy has shifted to primarily focus on higher margin ODM Projects that require custom products designed for specific applications to OEM customers, and away from actively marketing our superstore strategy of maintaining a vast quantity of electronic components to fill customer orders immediately from available stock held in inventory. As a result, we expect our components inventory will be more passively marketed and distributed online for clearance through our internet sales portal, however at potentially lower rates due to the pricing pressures normally attributed with online shopping. 


Index  

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our June 30, 2018, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 49% of current assets and 34% of total assets. However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash. We cannot assure you that demand in the discrete semiconductor market will increase and that market conditions will improve. Therefore, it is possible that further declines in our carrying values of inventory may result. 

Our gross profit margins are subject to a number of factors, including product demand, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, provisions for inventory reserves, our ability to purchase inventory at favorable prices and our sales product mix. 

Results of Operations 

Second quarter of 2018 versus 2017. 

Net sales in the second quarter of 2018 totaled $2,150,000 versus $1,773,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $377,000 or 21.3% over the same period last year. The increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales volume. 

Gross profit for the second quarter of 2018 was $979,000 versus $757,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 45.5% in the second quarter of 2018 versus 42.7% in the comparable period for 2017. The gross profit increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales unit pricing. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2018 totaled $550,000 versus $542,000 in the comparable period for 2017. The increase was driven by increased professional fees incurred for engineering services for our products. 

Other income, net of other expense, in the second quarter of 2018 was $29,000 versus $31,000 in the comparable period for 2017. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 

Income tax provision was $1,000 for the second quarter of 2018 and 2017, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2018. 

Net income was $399,000 for the second quarter of 2018 versus $215,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $184,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above. 

Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 versus Six Months Ended June 30, 2017. 

Net sales in the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $3,805,000 versus $3,940,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $135,000 or 3.4% over the same period last year. The decrease was driven by a decrease in demand for ODM components. 

Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $1,633,000 versus $1,630,000 in the comparable period for 2017, and gross margin percentage of net sales was approximately 42.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 41.4% for 2017, respectively. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2018 totaled $1,110,000 versus $1,082,000 in the comparable period for 2017. 

Interest expense, net of interest income, was $4,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 versus $20,000 in the comparable period for 2017. The decrease was driven by the reduction of outstanding debt obligations. See Note 4. 

Other income, net of other losses, in the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $77,000 versus $60,000 in the comparable period for 2017. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 

Income tax provision was $3,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 versus $1,000 in 2017, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2018. 

Net income was $458,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 versus $514,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $56,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have financed our operations with funds generated from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 

Cash flows provided by operating activities were $785,000 as opposed to $70,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of $715,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from inventory, accounts payables and accounts receivables compared to the prior period. 

Cash flows used for investing activities were $0 and $118,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Cash flows used for financing activities were $760,000 and $236,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Inventory is included in current assets; however, it will take over one year for the inventory to turn. Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash. 

We believe that funds generated from, or used in operations, in addition to existing cash balances are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of short-term commercial loans, asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of August 14, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
