DAKTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES


For the Quarter Ended August 3, 2019
PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Item 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS








NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



Note 1. Basis of Presentation

Daktronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”, “Daktronics”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) are the world's industry leader in designing and manufacturing electronic scoreboards, programmable display systems and large screen video displays for sporting, commercial and transportation applications.

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts therein. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results in future periods may differ from those estimates.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The balance sheet at April 27, 2019, has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but it does not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended April 27, 2019, which are contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year.

Daktronics, Inc. operates on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, with our fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to April 30 of each year. When April 30 falls on a Wednesday, the fiscal year ends on the preceding Saturday. Within each fiscal year, each quarter is comprised of 13-week periods following the beginning of each fiscal year. In each 53-week year, an additional week is added to the first quarter, and each of the last three quarters is comprised of a 13-week period. The fiscal year ended April 27, 2019 consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal 2020 will be a 53-week year; therefore, the quarter ended August 3, 2019 contains operating results for 14 weeks while the quarter ended July 28, 2018 contains operating results for 13 weeks.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements

There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies and estimates as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2019, other than described in the Accounting Standards Adopted section below.

Accounting Standards Adopted

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (that is, lessees and lessors). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. ASU 2016-02 requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842 (Leases) and ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, which provide (i) narrow amendments to clarify how to apply certain aspects of the new lease standard, (ii) entities with an additional transition method to adopt the new standard, and (iii) lessors with a practical expedient for separating components of a contract.

We adopted ASU 2016-02 and its related guidance during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 for all agreements existing as of April 28, 2019. We elected the "comparatives under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 840 option" as a transitional method, which allows us to initially apply the new lease requirements at the effective date. Comparative periods were not adjusted and will continue to be reported in accordance with prior lease guidance under ASC 840. We elected the package of practical expedients, which permits us not to reassess our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. In addition, we have elected the short-term lease recognition whereby we will not recognize operating leases related assets or liabilities for leases with a lease term of less than one year. We have also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components in the lease payments for all asset classes. This adoption did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows, and there was no adjustment to retained earnings. As of April 28, 2019, we recognized a right of use asset for operating leases of $11,101 and a current and non-current lease liability for operating leases of $2,745 and $8,356, respectively. The right of use operating assets are included in the "Investment in affiliates and other assets" line item, the current lease liabilities are included in the "Accrued expenses" line item, and the non-current lease liabilities are included in the "Other long-term obligations" line item in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. See "Note 12. Leases" for more information.

Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test. The amendment requires an entity to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. A goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and will require adoption on a prospective basis. We are currently evaluating the effect that adopting ASU 2017-04 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which provides guidance regarding the measurement and recognition of credit impairment for certain financial assets. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted, and will require adoption on a modified retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the effect that adopting ASU 2016-13 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Note 2. Investments in Affiliates

Investments in affiliates over which we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of ASC 323, Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Investments in affiliates over which we do not have the ability to exert significant influence over the affiliate's operating and financing activities are accounted for under the cost method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of ASC 321, Investments – Equity Securities. We have evaluated our relationships with our affiliates and have determined that these entities are not variable interest entities. 

The aggregate amount of investments accounted for under the equity method was $3,538 and $3,657 at August 3, 2019 and April 27, 2019, respectively. The equity method requires us to report our share of losses up to our equity investment amount. Cash paid for investments in affiliates and loans to affiliates are included in the "Purchases of and loans to equity investment" line item in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Our proportional share of the respective affiliates' earnings or losses is included in the "Other income (expense), net" line item in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended August 3, 2019 and July 28, 2018, our share of the losses of our affiliates was $118 and $134, respectively.

The aggregate amount of investments without readily determinable fair values was $42 at August 3, 2019 and April 27, 2019, respectively. There have not been any identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on their fair value, and it is not practical to estimate their fair value. We record equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less any impairment, adjusted for observable price changes. During the three months ended August 3, 2019, we did not record any changes in the measurement of such investments.

Note 3. Earnings Per Share ("EPS")

We follow the provisions of ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, where basic EPS is computed by dividing income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution which may occur if securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock which share in our earnings.



Options outstanding to purchase 2,197 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $10.03 for the three months ended August 3, 2019 and 1,798 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $10.46 for the three months ended July 28, 2018 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effects would be anti-dilutive.

Note 4. Revenue Recognition 

Disaggregation of revenue

In accordance with ASC 606-10-50, we disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers by the type of performance obligation and the timing of revenue recognition. We determine that disaggregating revenue in these categories achieves the disclosure objective to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors and to enable users of financial statements to understand the relationship to each reportable segment.




See "Note 5. Segment Reporting" for a disaggregation of revenue by geography.

Contract balances

Contract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed and include unbilled receivables. Unbilled receivables, which represent an unconditional right to payment subject only to the passage of time, are reclassified to accounts receivable when they are billed under the contract terms. Contract liabilities represent amounts billed to the clients in excess of revenue recognized to date.



The changes in our contract assets and contract liabilities from April 27, 2019 to August 3, 2019 were due to the timing of billing schedules and revenue recognition, which can vary significantly depending on the contractual payment terms and the seasonality of the sports markets. We had no material impairments of contract assets for the three months ended August 3, 2019. 

As of April 27, 2019, we had six contracts in progress that were identified as loss contracts, for which we recorded a provision for losses of $2,353 and had four remaining contracts with loss estimates of $531 as of August 3, 2019. These were included in the "Accrued expenses" line item in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

During the three months ended August 3, 2019, we recognized revenue of $31,259 related to our contract liabilities as of April 27, 2019.

Remaining performance obligations

As of August 3, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations was $263,406. We expect approximately $226,999 of our remaining performance obligations to be recognized over the next 12 months with the remainder recognized thereafter. Remaining performance obligations related to product and service agreements are $206,990 and $56,416, respectively. Although remaining performance obligations reflect business that is considered to be legally binding, cancellations, deferrals or scope adjustments may occur. Any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, foreign currency exchange fluctuations and project deferrals are reflected or excluded in the remaining performance obligation balance, as appropriate.

Note 5. Segment Reporting


administration expense, product design and development expense, non-operating income and expense, and income tax expense in the segment analysis. Separate financial information is available and regularly evaluated by our chief operating decision-maker (CODM), who is our president and chief executive officer, in making resource allocation decisions for our segments. 






We have numerous customers worldwide for sales of our products and services, and no customer accounted for 10% or more of net sales; therefore, we are not economically dependent on a limited number of customers for the sale of our products and services. 

We have numerous raw material and component suppliers, and no supplier accounts for 10% or more of our cost of sales; however, we have a number of single-source suppliers that could limit our supply or cause delays in obtaining raw material and components needed in manufacturing.

Note 6. Marketable Securities

We have a cash management program which provides for the investment of cash balances not used in current operations. We classify our investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale in accordance with the provisions of ASC 320, Investments – Debt and Equity Securities. Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As it relates to fixed income marketable securities, it is not likely we will be required to sell any of these investments before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis. In addition, as of August 3, 2019, we anticipate we will recover the entire amortized cost basis of such fixed income securities, and we have determined no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Where quoted market prices are not available, we use the market price of similar types of securities traded in the market to estimate fair value. 



Realized gains or losses on investments are recorded in our condensed consolidated statements of operations as "Other income (expense), net." Upon the sale of a security classified as available-for-sale, the security’s specific unrealized gain (loss) is reclassified out of 

accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings based on the specific identification method. In the three months ended August 3, 2019 and July 28, 2018, the reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net earnings were immaterial. 



Note 7. Business Combinations

AJT Systems, Inc. Acquisition

We acquired the net assets of AJT Systems, Inc. ("AJT"), a Florida-based company, on June 21, 2018. The results of its operations have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. We have not made pro forma disclosures about our acquisition of AJT because the results of its operations are not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

AJT is a developer of real-time live to air graphics rendering and video server systems for the broadcast TV industry. This acquisition will allow our organization to grow and strengthen our solution offerings to the market. This acquisition was primarily funded with cash on hand and with payments made over a three-year period.




We perform an analysis of goodwill on an annual basis, and it is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. We perform our annual analysis during our third quarter of each fiscal year, based on the goodwill amount as of the first business day of our third fiscal quarter. 

In conducting our impairment testing, we compare the fair value of each of our business units to the related carrying value of the allocated assets. We utilize the income approach based on discounted projected cash flows to estimate the fair value of each unit. The projected cash flows use many estimates including market conditions and expected market demand; our ability to grow or maintain market share and gross profit; and our expected expenditures for capital and operating expenses. Assets shared or not directly attributed to a reportable segment's activities are allocated to the reportable segment based on sales and other measures. 

We performed our annual impairment test on October 29, 2018 and concluded no goodwill impairment existed. We plan to complete our annual analysis as of the first business day of our third quarter of fiscal 2020, which will begin on November 4, 2019.

Note 9. Selected Financial Statement Data






We invoice customers based on a billing schedule as established in our contracts. We sometimes have the ability to file a contractor’s lien against the product installed as collateral and to file claims against surety bonds to protect our interest in receivables. Foreign sales are at times secured by irrevocable letters of credit or bank guarantees. Accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,292 and $2,208 at August 3, 2019 and April 27, 2019, respectively. Included in accounts receivable as of August 3, 2019 and April 27, 2019 was $828 and $440, respectively, of retainage on construction-type contracts, all of which is expected to be collected within one year.

In some contracts with customers, we agreed to installment payments exceeding 12 months. The present value of these contracts and leases are recorded as a receivable as the revenue is recognized in accordance with GAAP, and profit is recognized to the extent the present value is in excess of cost. We generally retain a security interest in the equipment or in the cash flow generated by the equipment until the contract is paid. The present value of long-term contracts and lease receivables, including accrued interest and current maturities, was $6,160 and $3,514 as of August 3, 2019 and April 27, 2019, respectively. Contract and lease receivables bearing annual interest rates of 5.0 to 9.0 percent are due in varying annual installments through 2024. The face amount of long-term receivables was $5,501 as of August 3, 2019 and $3,271 as of April 27, 2019.

Note 11. Share Repurchase Program

On June 17, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which we may purchase up to $40,000 of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock. Under this program, we may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions and in privately negotiated transactions based on business, market, applicable legal requirements and other considerations. The repurchase program does not require the repurchase of a specific number of shares and may be terminated at any time.

During the three months ended July 28, 2018, we had no repurchases of shares of our outstanding common stock. During the three months ended August 3, 2019, we repurchased 187 shares of common stock at a total cost of $1,187. As of August 3, 2019, we had $36,988 of remaining capacity under our current share repurchase program.


We lease facilities and various equipment to manufacture products and provide employee collaboration space and tools. These are all classified as operating leases and have initial lease terms ranging from one to five years. These operating leases do not contain material 

residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Our lease in Sioux Falls, SD has a purchase option. We do not have any financing leases.

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use asset includes any prepaid lease payments and initial direct costs and excludes any lease incentives and impairments. Some of our leases include options to extend the term, which is only included in the right-of-use assets and lease liability calculation when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and we have elected to account for all asset classes as a single lease component. Our operating leases also typically require payment of real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance. These components comprise the majority of our variable lease cost and are excluded from the present value of our lease obligations. In instances where they are fixed, they are included due to our election to combine lease and non-lease components. Our total variable lease costs are immaterial.


  Three Months Ended August 3, 2019

Operating lease cost(1) $852





  Three Months Ended August 3, 2019


Operating cash flows from operating leases $816




Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies


accrual or disclosure of a potential range of loss has been made related to these matters. We do not expect the ultimate liability of these unresolved legal proceedings or claims to have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity or capital resources.






Note 14. Income Taxes

We calculate the provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to “ordinary” income or loss (pre-tax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the reporting period. Due to various factors and operating in multiple state and foreign jurisdictions, our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation. We recorded an effective tax rate of 12.6 percent for the three months ended August 3, 2019 and an effective tax rate benefit of 13.1 percent for the three months ended July 28, 2018. The changes in the effective tax rates are primarily driven by the benefit of research and development tax credits and foreign tax credits proportionate to pre-tax book income for each period.

We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income taxes of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. Fiscal years 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 remain open to federal tax examinations, and fiscal years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 remain open for various state income tax examinations. Certain subsidiaries are also subject to income tax in several foreign jurisdictions which have open tax years varying by jurisdiction beginning in fiscal 2009. In the event of any future tax assessments, we have elected to record the income taxes and any related interest and penalties as income tax expense in our condensed consolidated statement of operations.

As of August 3, 2019, undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were considered to be reinvested indefinitely. Additionally, we had $727 of unrecognized tax benefits which would reduce our effective tax rate if recognized.

Note 15. Fair Value Measurement

The following table sets forth by Level within the fair value hierarchy our financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis at August 3, 2019 and April 27, 2019 according to the valuation techniques we used to determine their fair values. There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities among the fair value hierarchies presented.




There have been no changes in the valuation techniques used by us to value our financial instruments since the end of fiscal 2019. For additional information, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2019 for the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument.

Note 16. Derivative Financial Instruments

We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage the economic impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on those transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency, which is the U.S. dollar. We enter into currency forward contracts to manage these economic risks. We account for all derivatives in the condensed consolidated balance sheets within accounts receivable or accounts payable measured at fair value, and changes in fair values are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met for cash flow or net investment hedges. As of August 3, 2019 and April 27, 2019, we had not designated any of our derivative instruments as accounting hedges, and thus we recorded the changes in fair value in the "Other income (expense), net" line item in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.



As of August 3, 2019, there was an asset and liability of $334 and $10, respectively, and as of April 27, 2019, there was an asset and liability of $91 and $4, respectively, representing the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts, which were determined using Level 2 inputs from a third-party bank. As of August 3, 2019, all contracts mature within 20 months.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (including exhibits and any information incorporated by reference herein) contains both historical and forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The statements contained in this Report that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, intentions and strategies for the future. These statements appear in a number of places in this Report and include all statements that are not historical statements of fact regarding the intent, belief or current expectations with respect to, among other things: (i.) our competition; (ii.) our financing plans; (iii.) trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations; (iv.) our growth and operating strategies; (v.) the declaration and payment of dividends; (vi.) the timing and magnitude of future contracts; (vii.) raw material shortages and lead times; (viii.) fluctuations in margins; (ix.) the seasonality of our business; (x.) the introduction of new products and technology; (xi.) the amount and frequency of warranty claims; (xii.) our ability to manage the impact that new or adjusted tariffs may have on the cost of raw materials and components and our ability to sell product internationally; (xiii.) the resolution of litigation contingencies; and (xiv.) the timing and magnitude of any acquisitions or dispositions. The words “may,” “would,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “expect,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan” and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our ability to control, and that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors discussed herein, including those discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2019 in the section entitled “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and those factors discussed in detail in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. The preparation of these condensed financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to total costs on long-term construction-type contracts, costs to be incurred for product warranties and extended maintenance contracts, bad debts, excess and obsolete inventory, income taxes, share-based compensation, goodwill impairment and contingencies. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

OVERVIEW

We design, manufacture and sell a wide range of display systems to customers throughout the world. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on markets, geographical regions and products. Our five business segments consist of four domestic business units and the International business unit. The four domestic business units consist of Commercial, Live Events, High School Park and Recreation, 

and Transportation, all of which include the geographic territories of the United States and Canada. Disclosures related to our business segments are provided in "Note 5. Segment Reporting" of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

Our net sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of uniquely configured orders, such as display systems for professional sports facilities, colleges and universities, and spectacular projects in the commercial area, as well as the seasonality of the sports market. Uniquely configured orders can include several displays, controllers, and subcontracted structure builds, each of which can occur on varied schedules per the customer's needs. Outdoor installation sales can be impacted by outdoor weather conditions and the construction season. Our third fiscal quarter tends to be a slower quarter because it includes two holidays, it is affected by sports seasonality, and generally less outdoor construction work occurs due to weather conditions. 

Our gross margins tend to fluctuate more on uniquely configured orders than on limited configured orders. Uniquely configured orders involving competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins. Although we follow the over time method of recognizing revenues for uniquely configured orders, we nevertheless have experienced fluctuations in operating results and expect our future results of operations will be subject to similar fluctuations.

Our remaining performance obligations ("backlog") consist of contractually binding sales agreements or purchase orders for integrated electronic display systems and related products and service. Orders are included in backlog when we are in receipt of an executed contract and any required deposits or security. As a result, certain orders for which we have received binding letters of intent or contracts will not be included in backlog until all required contractual documents and deposits are received. Backlog can fluctuate due to large order bookings and the timing and seasonality of net sales. Because order backlog fluctuates and may be subject to extended delivery schedules, orders may be canceled and have varied estimated profitability. Our backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales or net income. Backlog is not a measure defined by GAAP, and our methodology for determining backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts.

GENERAL

Our mission is to be the world leader at informing and entertaining audiences through dynamic audio-visual communication systems. We organize into business units to focus on customer loyalty over time to earn new and replacement business because our products have a finite lifetime. See "Note 5. Segment Reporting" of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for further information. Our strategies include the creation of a comprehensive line of innovative solutions and systems and our ability to create and leverage platform designs and technologies. These strategies align us to effectively deliver value to our varied customers and their market needs, while serving our stakeholders over the long-term. We focus on creating local capabilities for sales, service, and manufacturing in geographies with expected digital market opportunities. We believe consistently generating profitable growth will provide value to our stakeholders (customers, employees, shareholders, suppliers, and communities).


•our percentage of market share by comparing our estimated revenue to the total estimated global digital display revenue,

•our order growth compared to the overall digital market order change,

•financial metrics such as annual order volume and profit change as compared to our previous financial results,

•customer retention and expansion rates, and 

•our ability to generate profits over the long-term to provide a shareholder return.

Certain factors impact our ability to succeed in these strategies and impact our business units to varying degrees. For example, the overall cost to manufacture and the selling prices of our products have decreased over the years and are expected to continue to decrease in the future. Our competitors outside the U.S. are impacted differently by the global trade environment allowing them to avoid tariff costs or reduce prices. As a result, additional competitors have entered the market, and each year we must sell more product to generate the same or greater level of net sales as in previous fiscal years. However, the decline of digital solution pricing over the years and increased user adoption and applications have increased the size of the global market.

Competitor offerings, actions and reactions also can vary and change over time or in certain customer situations. Projects with multimillion-dollar revenue potential attracts competition, and competitors can use marketing or other tactics to win business.

Each of our business unit's long-term performance can be impacted by economic conditions in different ways and to different degrees. The effects of an adverse economy are generally less severe on our sports related business as compared to our other businesses, although in severe economic downturns, the sports business can also be seriously impacted.

We can be impacted by short-term events like the U.S. Administrative trade actions in 2018 or a number of other factors that are disclosed in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2019.



•Standard display product market growth due to market adoption and lower product costs, which drive marketplace expansion. Standard display products are used to attract or communicate with customers and potential customers of retail, commercial, and other establishments. Pricing and economic conditions are the principal factors that impact our success in this business unit. We utilize a reseller network to distribute our standard products.

•National accounts standard display market opportunities due to customers' desire to communicate their message, advertising and content consistently across the country. Increased demand is possible from national retailers, quick serve restaurants, petroleum retailers, and other nationwide organizations. 

•Additional standard display offerings using micro-light emitting diode ("LED") designs.

•Increasing use of LED technologies replacing signage previously using liquid crystal display ("LCD") technology by existing and new customers.

•Increasing interest in spectaculars, which include very large and sometimes highly customized displays as part of entertainment venues such as casinos, shopping centers, cruise ships and Times Square type locations.

•Dynamic messaging systems demand growth due to market adoption and expanded use of this technology. 

•The use of architectural lighting products for commercial buildings, which real estate owners use to add accents or effects to an entire side or circumference of a building to communicate messages or to decorate the building.

•The continued deployment of digital billboards as Out-of-Home ("OOH") advertising companies continue developing new sites and replacing digital billboards reaching end of life. This is dependent on no adverse changes occurring in the digital billboard regulatory environment restricting future billboard deployments, as well as maintaining our current market share in a business that is concentrated in a few large OOH companies.

•Replacement cycles within each of these areas. 


•Facilities spending more on larger display systems to enhance the game-day and event experience for attendees.

•Lower product costs, driving an expansion of the marketplace.

•Our product and service offerings, including additional micro-LED offerings which remain the most integrated and comprehensive offerings in the industry.

•The competitive nature of sports teams, which strive to out-perform their competitors with display systems.

•The desire for high-definition video displays, which typically drives larger displays or higher resolution displays, both of which increase the average transaction size.

•Dynamic messaging system needs throughout a sports facility.

•Increasing use of LED technologies replacing signage previously using LCD technology in and surrounding live events facilities.

•Replacement cycles within each of these areas. 


•Increased demand for video systems in high schools as school districts realize the revenue generating potential of these displays compared to traditional scoreboards and these systems' ability to provide or enhance academic curriculum offerings for students.

•Increased demand for different types of displays and dynamic messaging systems, such as message centers at schools to communicate to students, parents and the broader community.

•Lower system costs driving the use of more sophisticated displays in school athletic facilities, such as large integrated video systems.

•Expanding control system options tailored for the markets' needs.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Daktronics, Inc. operates on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, with our fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to April 30 of each year. When April 30 falls on a Wednesday, the fiscal year ends on the preceding Saturday. Within each fiscal year, each quarter is comprised of 13-week periods following the beginning of each fiscal year. In each 53-week year, an additional week is added to the first quarter, and each of the last three quarters is comprised of a 13-week period. The fiscal year ended April 27, 2019 consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal 2020 will be a 53-week year; therefore, the quarter ended August 3, 2019 contains operating results for 14 weeks while the quarter ended July 28, 2018 contains operating results for 13 weeks.

COMPARISON OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 AND JULY 28, 2018 

Net Sales


Sales and orders were impacted as a result of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 including 14 weeks compared to the more common 13 weeks. The first quarter of fiscal 2019 contained 13 weeks. 

For net sales, during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we achieved a $12.9 million per week average run rate as compared to $11.9 million per week during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, or an approximate 8.6% increase. This change was driven by the order volume reasons described below and the timing of conversion related to the seasonality in our business.

For orders, during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we achieved a $13.4 million per week average run rate as compared to $12.3 million per week during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, or an approximate 9.1% increase. We had an increase in orders placed during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 related to new releases of our product offerings.


The increase in orders for the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the same period one year ago was primarily due to the timing of projects in the on-premise and OOH niches. 


Orders increased for the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the same period one year ago due to an increase in the number of projects for professional sports, arenas, and college and universities venues.


Orders decreased for the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the same period one year ago due to variability in order timing and a decrease in large video projects compared to the same period last year.


Orders for the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the same period one year ago remained relatively flat. 


Orders increased for the three months ended August 3, 2019 compared to the same period one year ago primarily due to general variations in the timing of large contracts and account-based order placements.

Product Order Backlog

The product order backlog as of August 3, 2019 was $207 million as compared to $177 million as of July 28, 2018 and $202 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Historically, our product order backlog varies due to the seasonality of our business, the timing of large projects, and customer delivery schedules for these orders. The product order backlog as of August 3, 2019 increased in our Live Events, Transportation, and International business units from July 28, 2018 and decreased in our High School Park and Recreation business unit.

Gross Profit


Gross profit is net sales less cost of sales. Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory, consumables, salaries, other employee-related costs, facilities-related costs for manufacturing locations, machinery and equipment maintenance and depreciation, site sub-contractors, warranty costs, and other service delivery expenses.







Contribution Margin


Contribution margin consists of gross profit less selling expenses. Selling expenses consist primarily of salaries, other employee-related costs, travel and entertainment expenses, facility-related costs for sales and service offices, bad debt expenses, third-party commissions and expenditures for marketing efforts, including the costs of collateral materials, conventions and trade shows, product demonstrations, customer relationship management systems, and supplies. 


All areas of selling expenses were impacted as a result of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 including 14 weeks compared to the more common 13 weeks. The first quarter of fiscal 2019 contained 13 weeks. Selling expense in our Commercial, Live Events, and High School Park and Recreation business units increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same quarter a year ago due to personnel related expenses. Selling expense in our International business unit decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same quarter a year ago due to a decrease in third-party commissions. Selling expense in our Transportation business unit for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 remained relatively flat compared to the same quarter a year ago. 

Other Operating Expenses


All areas of operating expenses were impacted as a result of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 including 14 weeks compared to the more common 13 weeks. The first quarter of fiscal 2019 contained 13 weeks.

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, other employee-related costs, professional fees, shareholder relations costs, facilities and equipment-related costs for administrative departments, training costs, and the cost of supplies. 

General and administrative expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased as compared to the same period one year ago primarily due to the additional week of operating results added to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. 

Product design and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, other employee-related costs, professional services, facilities costs and equipment-related costs and supplies. Product design and development investments in the near term are focused on developing or improving our video technology over a wide range of pixel pitches for both indoor and outdoor applications. These new or improved 

technologies are focused on varied pixel density for image quality and use, expanded product line offerings for our various markets and geographies, improved quality and reliability, and improved cost points. We plan to make continued investments in our software and controller capabilities throughout our various product offerings. Through our design efforts, we focus on standardizing display components and control systems for both single site and network displays. 

Our costs for product design and development represent an allocated amount of costs based on time charges, professional services, material costs and the overhead of our engineering departments. Generally, a significant portion of our engineering time is spent on product design and development, while the rest is allocated to large contract work and included in cost of sales. 

Product design and development expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased as compared to the same period one year ago primarily due to the additional week of operating results added to the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and for increased labor costs and professional services assigned to product design and development projects. To deliver value to our customers and serve the markets' expectations, we expect an increase in expenditures for new or enhanced customer solutions. 

Other Income and Expenses 



The change in interest income, net for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period one year ago was primarily due to the change in investment levels caused by the volatility of working capital needs.


Income Taxes

We calculate the provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to “ordinary” income or loss (pretax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequently occurring discrete items) for the reporting period. Due to various factors, including having operations in multiple jurisdictions worldwide, our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation. 

We have recorded a tax rate of 12.6 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to an effective tax rate benefit of 13.1 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily driven by the benefit of research and development tax credits and foreign tax credits proportionate to pre-tax book income for each period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



Net cash used in operating activities was $18.2 million for the first three months of fiscal 2020 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $10.3 million in the first three months of fiscal 2019. The $7.9 million increase in cash used in operating activities from the first three months of fiscal 2019 to the first three months of fiscal 2020 was the result of changes in net operating assets and liabilities of $10.4 million and $0.1 million in depreciation and amortization, adjusted by a $2.5 million increase in net income and $0.1 million in other non-cash items, net.



Overall, changes in net operating assets and liabilities can be impacted by the timing of cash flows on large orders, which can cause significant short-term and seasonal fluctuations in inventory, accounts receivables, accounts payable, contract assets and liabilities, and various other operating assets and liabilities. Variability in contract assets and liabilities relates to the timing of billings on construction-type contracts and revenue recognition, which can vary significantly depending on contractual payment terms and build and installation schedules. Balances are also impacted by the sports market seasonality. 




Working capital was $120.2 million and $119.6 million at August 3, 2019 and April 27, 2019, respectively. The changes in working capital, particularly changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, inventory, and contract assets and liabilities, and the sports market seasonality can have a significant impact on the amount of net cash provided by operating activities largely due to the timing of payments and receipts. On multimillion-dollar orders, the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to or exceed 12 months depending on the amount of custom work and a customer’s delivery needs. We often receive down payments or progress payments on these orders.

We had $4.0 million of retainage on long-term contracts included in receivables and contract assets as of August 3, 2019, which has an impact on our liquidity. We expect to collect these amounts within one year. When working capital is needed, we have historically financed our cash needs through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under bank credit agreements.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we violated one of our bank covenants, but we received a waiver from our banking institution for the year ended April 27, 2019. As of August 3, 2019, we were in compliance with all applicable bank loan covenants.

On November 15, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement and a related revolving note with a U.S. bank. The revolving amount of the agreement and note is $35.0 million, including up to $15.0 million for commercial and standby letters of credit, with a maturity date of November 15, 2019. As of August 3, 2019, there were no advances to us under the loan portion of the line of credit, and the balance of letters of credit outstanding was approximately $9.5 million. On November 15, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated loan agreement and a continuing and unlimited guaranty agreement with another U.S. bank which supports our credit needs outside of the United States. The revolving amount of the loan is $20.0 million, with a maturity date of November 15, 2019. As of August 3, 2019, there were no advances outstanding under the loan agreement and approximately $7.8 million in bank guarantees under this line of credit. 

For more information on these agreements, see "Note 10. Financing Agreements" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2019. We expect to enter into a new credit facility, loan agreement, and guaranty agreement prior to our current agreements expiring in November 2019.

We are sometimes required to obtain performance bonds for display installations, and we have a bonding line available through a surety company for an aggregate of $150.0 million in bonded work outstanding. If we were unable to complete the work, and our customer would call upon the bond for payment, the surety company would subrogate its loss to Daktronics. At August 3, 2019, we had $21.8 million of bonded work outstanding against this line.

Our business growth and profitability improvement strategies depend on investments in capital expenditures and strategic investments. We are projecting capital expenditures to be less than $25 million for fiscal 2020 for purchases of manufacturing equipment for new or enhanced product production, expanded capacity, investments in quality and reliability equipment, and continued information infrastructure investments. We also evaluate and may invest in new technologies or acquire companies aligned with our business strategy. 

We believe our working capital available from all sources will be adequate to meet the cash requirements of our operations and strategies in the foreseeable future. If our growth extends beyond current expectations, or if we make significant strategic investments, we may need to utilize and possibly increase our credit facilities or seek other means of financing. We anticipate we will be able to obtain any needed funds under commercially reasonable terms from our current lenders or other sources, although this availability cannot be guaranteed.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

There has been no material change in our off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations since the fiscal year ended April 27, 2019. For additional information, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2019.
