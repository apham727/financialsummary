 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements




The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and therefore do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP); however, such information reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.

The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, some of the Company’s statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q may involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected future results. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year.

Reclassification

The Company has reclassified the presentation of certain prior-year information to conform to the current presentation. 

The Company reclassified immaterial amounts of $1.9 and $5.9 from cost of sales to selling and administrative expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. The amounts represent selling costs that were incorrectly being recorded within cost of sales. The Company also corrected an immaterial amount of $3.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

The Company reclassified an immaterial amount of $8.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 within the operating activities of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows between depreciation and amortization and certain other assets and liabilities to correct its presentation. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance



The Company utilizes lease agreements to meet its operating needs. These leases support global staff via the use of office space, warehouses, vehicles and information technology (IT) equipment. The Company utilizes both operating and finance leases in its portfolio of leased assets, however, the majority of these leases are classified as operating. A significant portion of the volume of the lease portfolio is in fleet vehicles and IT office equipment; however, real estate leases constitute a majority of the value of the ROU assets. Lease agreements are utilized worldwide, with the largest location concentration in the United States, Germany and India.


•The Company elected the option to apply the transition requirements in ASC 842 at the effective date of January 1, 2019. 

•The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed the Company to carry forward its ASC 840 assessment regarding definition of a lease, lease classification and initial direct costs.

•The practical expedient related to land easements is not applicable as the Company currently does not utilize any easements.

•The Company declined the hindsight practical expedient to determine the lease term and ROU asset impairment for existing leases. The decision to decline the hindsight practical expedient resulted in relying on assessments made under ASC 840 during transition and re-assessing under ASC 842 going forward. 

•The Company declined the short-term lease exception, therefore recognizing all leases in the ROU asset and lease liability balances. Consistent with ASC 842 requirements, leases that are one month or less are not included in the balance.

•The Company elected to not separate non-lease components from lease components and, instead, to account for each separate lease component and the non-lease components associated with it as a single lease component, recognized on the balance sheet. This election has been made for all classes of underlying assets. 

•





The weighted-average discount rates used for operating and finance leases varies due to the jurisdictional composition. The Company has an immaterial amount of finance leases that are primarily comprised of leases in Turkey which have higher interest rates.

Certain lease agreements include payments based on a variety of global indexes or rates. These payment amounts have been projected using the index or rate as of lease commencement or the transition date and measured in ROU assets and lease liabilities. Other leases contain variable payments that are based on actual usage of the underlying assets and, therefore, are not measured in assets or liabilities as the variable payments are not based on an index or a rate. For real estate leases, these payments are most often tied to non-committed maintenance or utilities charges, and for equipment leases, to actual output or hours in operation. These amounts typically become known when the invoice is received, which is when expense is recognized. In rare circumstances, the Company's lease agreements may contain residual value guarantees. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any restrictions or covenants, such as those relating to dividends or incurring additional financial obligations.

As of September 30, 2019, the Company did not have any material leases that have not yet commenced but that create significant rights and obligations.

The Company determines whether an arrangement is or includes a lease at contract inception. All contracts containing the right to use an underlying asset are reviewed to confirm that the contract meets the definition of a lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date and initially measured based on the present value of lease payments over the defined lease term.

As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. In order to apply the incremental borrowing rate, a rate table was developed to assign the appropriate rate to each lease based on lease term and currency of payments. For leases with large numbers of underlying assets, a portfolio approach with a collateralized rate was utilized. Assets were grouped based on similar lease terms and economic environments in a manner whereby the Company reasonably expects that the application does not differ materially from a lease-by-lease approach.

Finance leases are included in other assets, other current liabilities and other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 


Basic earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding. Under the two-class method of computing earnings (loss) per share, non-vested share-based payment awards that contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends are considered participating securities. The Company’s participating securities include restricted stock units (RSUs), director deferred shares and shares that were vested but deferred by employees. The Company calculated basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share under both the treasury stock method and the two-class method. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, there were no differences in the earnings (loss) per share amounts calculated under the two methods. Accordingly, the treasury stock method is disclosed below.

The Company’s share-based compensation payments to employees are recognized based on their grant-date fair values during the period in which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. Share-based compensation is primarily recognized as a component of selling and administrative expense. Total share-based compensation expense was $5.3 and $6.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and was $19.4 and $27.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In the first quarter of 2019, the Company changed its accounting estimate from using a forfeiture assumption to recording actual forfeitures. The change resulted in an immaterial increase in share-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2019. Share-based compensation decreased $7.8 to $19.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to a reduction in performance shares awarded in 2019.

The options expected to vest are the result of applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumption to total outstanding non-vested options.



Performance shares are granted to employees and vest based on the achievement of certain performance objectives, as determined by the board of directors each year. Each performance share earned entitles the holder to one common share of the Company. The Company's performance shares include performance objectives that are assessed after a three-year period as well as performance objectives that are assessed annually over a three-year period. No shares are vested unless certain performance threshold objectives are met.

As of September 30, 2019, there were 0.1 non-employee director deferred shares vested and outstanding.

On April 25, 2019, the Company's shareholders approved amendments to the 2017 Plan, which provide for an additional 3.0 common shares available for award. The 2017 Plan is expected to attract and retain directors, officers and employees of the Company by providing incentives and rewards for performance.


The effective tax rate on the loss from continuing operations was (17.2) percent for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and (50.8) percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The expense on the loss was primarily due to the tax impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) on the estimated projected tax rate, more specifically, the impacts related to global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) and the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT). In addition, during the first quarter the

Company collapse of the Barbados structure to meet the covenant requirements under its credit agreement, which resulted in additional discrete tax expense of $48.4 inclusive of the offsetting valuation allowance release relating to the Company’s nondeductible interest expense that was carried forward from December 31, 2018. No taxes are currently payable related to the collapsed Barbados structure. The above items noted, as well as the Company’s jurisdictional income (loss) mix and varying statutory rates, are the primary drivers of the estimated projected tax rate. 

The Company’s actual effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 included the U.S. federal tax effects attributable to tax provision to return adjustments related to the Company’s 2018 U.S. federal tax return and the amendment of the 2015 U.S. federal return. As of September 30, 2019, the Company has not completed the 2018 U.S. federal tax return filing. However, upon further analysis of certain aspects of the Tax Act and refinements to the Company’s calculations, the Company recognized a tax expense of $6.4 related to the 2018 tax year. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2019, the Company amended its 2015 U.S. federal tax return and recognized tax expense of $2.8 related to the reduction of various foreign tax credit carryforwards. Both increases to U.S. federal tax expense have been reported as discrete items for the period ended September 30, 2019. The Company will finalize its 2018 tax provision to return adjustments in the periods in which the Company files its tax returns on foreign and state jurisdictions. The final impact of the tax provision to return adjustments may differ as additional guidance and information becomes available.

Also included in tax expense is $2.3 of anticipated taxes related to the Company’s change in indefinite reinvestment assertion on undistributed earnings of a certain subsidiary. 

The effective tax rate on the loss before taxes was (22.3) percent for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and (8.5) percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The expense on the loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge, the impacts of the Tax Act and the higher interest expense burden resulting from the debt restructuring. More specifically, the expense on the loss reflects refinement of the transition tax, the impacts related to GILTI and the business interest deduction limitation which, as a result of the Company’s debt restructuring activities during the third quarter of 2018, required a full valuation allowance on the current year nondeductible business interest expense. In addition, the benefit on the losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was reduced by the goodwill impairment charge, which for tax purposes is primarily nondeductible, of $134.4 and $83.1 incurred in the third and second quarters of 2018, respectively. 




The increase in finished goods inventory was primarily attributable to the Company's expected orders through the balance of the year. The decrease in service parts was primarily attributable to reduced purchases in the United States, Asia Pacific, and Germany. 


The Company’s investments, primarily in Brazil, consist of certificates of deposit that are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI). Realized gains and losses are recognized in investment income and are determined using the specific identification method. There were no realized gains from the sale of securities or proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.

The Company has deferred compensation plans that enable certain employees to defer receipt of a portion of their cash, 401(k) or share-based compensation and non-employee directors to defer receipt of director fees at the participants’ discretion. For deferred cash-based compensation, the Company established rabbi trusts (refer to note 18), which are recorded at fair value of the underlying

Securities and other investments also includes a cash surrender value of insurance contracts of $8.1 and $11.1 as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to death benefits paid. In addition, it includes an interest rate swap asset carrying value of $0.4 and $4.8 as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which also represents fair value (refer to note 18).


of businesses, which may include the exit or restructuring of these businesses.

In May 2017, the Company announced a strategic partnership with Kony, a leading enterprise mobility and application company, to offer white label mobile application solutions for financial institutions and retailers. In September 2019, the Company's interest in Kony was sold for cash proceeds of $21.3. The Company's carrying value in Kony was $14.0, resulting in a gain of $7.3.

The Company provides financing arrangements to customers purchasing its products. These financing arrangements are largely classified and accounted for as sales-type leases.

There were no significant changes in provision for credit losses, recoveries and write-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. As of September 30, 2019, finance leases and notes receivable individually evaluated for impairment were $33.4 and $4.8, respectively, with no provision recorded. As of September 30, 2018, finance leases and notes receivable individually evaluated for impairment were $30.5 and $10.8, respectively. There have been no material changes to the balances on the finance lease receivables maturity schedule since December 31, 2018. The income related to the finance lease receivables was minimal for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.

The Company records interest income and any fees or costs related to financing receivables using the effective interest method over the term of the lease or loan. The Company reviews the aging of its financing receivables to determine past due and delinquent accounts. Credit quality is reviewed at inception and is re-evaluated as needed based on customer-specific circumstances. Receivable balances 60 days to 89 days past due are reviewed and may be placed on nonaccrual status based on customer-specific circumstances. Receivable balances are placed on nonaccrual status upon reaching greater than 89 days past due. Upon receipt of payment on nonaccrual financing receivables, interest income is recognized and accrual of interest is resumed once the account has been made current or the specific circumstances have been resolved.

In accordance with the Company's accounting policy, goodwill will be tested for impairment as of October 31, 2019.

During the second quarter of 2018, the Company performed an impairment test of goodwill for all of its line of business (LoB) reporting units due to the change in its reportable operating segments. Based on the results of the LoB testing, the fair values of each of the Company's reporting units exceed their carrying values except for the Services-Asia Pacific (AP) and Software-Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) reporting units, which resulted in a non-cash impairment loss of $83.1 during the second quarter 2018. 

The Company has identified four reporting units, which are Eurasia Banking, Americas Banking, EMEA Retail and Rest of World Retail. Management determined that the Americas Banking and EMEA Retail reporting units had a cushion of approximately 20 percent and 10 percent, respectively, when compared to their carrying amounts. The Eurasia Banking reporting unit had minimal excess fair value or cushion when compared to their carrying amounts, but primarily due to the reporting unit's improved performance, it did not indicate any impairment during the qualitative annual goodwill impairment test. Rest of World Retail had no carrying value as of December 31, 2018. Changes in certain assumptions or the Company's failure to execute on the current plan could have a significant impact to the estimated fair value of the reporting units.

During the second and third quarters of 2018, the Company estimated the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of the income valuation and market approach methodologies. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions, including significant unobservable inputs. The key inputs included, but were not limited to, discount rates, terminal growth rates, market multiple data from selected guideline public companies, management’s internal forecasts which include numerous assumptions such as projected net sales, gross profit, sales mix, operating and capital expenditures and earnings before interest and taxes margins, among others.

The Company considers the factors listed in ASC 350-20-35-3C for its interim impairment evaluations. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company experienced overall negative financial performance, which resulted in significant forecast changes compared to the prior impairment analysis, along with key personnel changes and a sustained decrease in share price. As a result of these impairment triggering events, the Company performed an interim impairment test of goodwill for its four reporting units during the third quarter of 2018. Based on the results of the impairment testing, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment

charge of $134.4 related to the Eurasia Banking, EMEA Retail and Rest of World Retail reporting units during the third quarter of 2018. 



Amortization expense on capitalized software of $8.2 and $8.8 was included in service and software cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization expense on capitalized software of $25.1 and $25.6 was included in service and software cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company's total amortization expense, including deferred financing costs, was $35.9 and $38.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company's total amortization expense, including deferred financing costs, was $109.5 and $114.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.


The Company provides its global operations guarantees and standby letters of credit through various financial institutions for suppliers, customers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers. If the Company is not able to make payments or fulfill contractual obligations, the suppliers, customers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers may draw on the pertinent bank. At September 30, 2019, the maximum future payment obligations related to these various guarantees totaled $108.7, of which $26.7 represented standby letters of credit to insurance providers, and no associated liability was recorded. At December 31, 2018, the maximum future payment obligations relative to these various guarantees totaled $135.2, of which $27.5 represented standby letters of credit to insurance providers, and no associated liability was recorded.

The Company provides its customers a manufacturer’s warranty and records, at the time of the sale, a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs. Estimated future obligations due to warranty claims are based upon historical factors such as labor rates, average repair time, travel time, number of service calls per machine and cost of replacement parts.

Management determined this error was not material to the prior period and recorded the correction in the three months ended June 30, 2019 resulting in a $9.5 charge in the loss (gain) on the sale of assets, net. 

In the second quarter of 2019, the Company divested its remaining SecurCash B.V entity included in the Eurasia Banking operating segment resulting in a loss of $1.1.

The Company has qualified retirement plans covering certain U.S. employees that have been closed to new participants since 2003 and frozen since December 2013. Plans that cover salaried employees provide retirement benefits based on an employee’s compensation during the ten years before the date of the plan freeze or the date of the employee's actual separation from service, if earlier. The Company’s funding policy for salaried plans is to contribute annually based on actuarial projections and applicable regulations. Plans covering hourly employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service. The Company’s funding policy for hourly plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by applicable regulations.

The Company has non-qualified pension plans to provide supplemental retirement benefits to certain officers, which have also been frozen since December 2013. Benefits are payable at retirement based upon a percentage of the participant’s compensation, as defined. In addition to providing retirement benefits, the Company provides post-employment healthcare and life insurance benefits (referred to as other benefits) for certain retired employees. Retired eligible employees in the United States may be entitled to these benefits based upon years of service with the Company, age at retirement and collective bargaining agreements. There are no plan assets and the Company funds the benefits as the claims are paid. The post-employment benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and life insurance plans together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates.

The Company also has defined benefit plans in Germany and Switzerland, among others. In Germany, post-employment benefit plans are set up as employer funded pension plans and deferred compensation plans. The employer funded pension commitments in Germany are based upon direct performance-related commitments in terms of defined contribution plans. Each beneficiary receives, depending on individual pay-scale grouping, contractual classification or income level, different yearly contributions. The contribution is multiplied by an age factor appropriate to the respective pension plan and credited to the individual retirement account of the employee. The retirement accounts may be used up at retirement by either a one-time lump-sum payout or payments of up to ten years. Insured events include disability, death and reaching of retirement age. In Switzerland, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The employees receive their pension payments as a function of contributions paid, a fixed interest rate and annuity factors. Insured events are disability, death and reaching of retirement age.

During the third quarter of 2019, the Company identified a new non-U.S. benefit obligation in Germany. As a result, the obligation was measured and a liability in the amount of $6.6 was recorded on the balance sheet, with a corresponding charge to the statement of operations.

Contributions

There have been no significant changes to the expected 2019 plan year contribution amounts previously disclosed. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, contributions of $30.9 and $29.2, respectively, were made to the qualified and non-qualified pension plans. The Company received a reimbursement of $12.2 for certain benefits paid from its trustee in June 2019. In March 2018, the Company received a $13.8 reimbursement for certain benefits paid from its trustee. 


The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business or financing activities. The Company’s derivative foreign currency instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and cash payments principally related to the Company’s non-functional currency assets and liabilities. The Company's interest rate derivatives are used to manage the differences in amount due to variable-rate interest rate borrowings.

Interest Rate

Cash Flow Hedges The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. The Company estimates that a minimal amount will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense over the next year.

In September 2019, the Company entered into multiple pay-fixed receive-variable interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $500.0. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.

In November 2016, the Company entered into multiple pay-fixed receive-variable interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $400.0. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.

The Company has an interest rate swap for a nominal sum of €50.0, which was entered into in May 2010, with a ten-year term from October 1, 2010 until September 30, 2020. The interest rate swap is not designated and changes in the fair value of non-designated interest rate swap agreements are recognized in miscellaneous, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized $0.5 and $1.5 in interest expense relating to the interest rate swap for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively.

Additionally, the Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any additional derivatives that are not designated as hedges.

Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value



The Company uses the end of period when determining the timing of transfers between levels. During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, there were no transfers between levels. 



Refer to note 11 for further details surrounding the Company's long-term debt as of September 30, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. Additionally, the Company remeasures certain assets to fair value, using Level 3 measurements, as a result of the occurrence of triggering events. In the second and third quarters of 2018, in connection with certain triggering events, the Company performed impairment tests of goodwill for all of its reporting units, refer to note 8 for further details. Besides goodwill from certain reporting units noted above, there were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the period presented.

Contractual Obligation

At September 30, 2019, the Company had purchase commitments due within one year totaling $0.1 for materials and services through contract manufacturing agreements at negotiated prices. The Company guarantees a fixed cost of certain products used in production to its China strategic partners.

Indirect Tax Contingencies

The Company accrues non-income-tax liabilities for indirect tax matters when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. In the event any losses are sustained in excess of accruals, they are charged against income. In evaluating indirect tax matters, management takes into consideration factors such as historical experience with matters of similar nature, specific facts and circumstances and the likelihood of prevailing. Management evaluates and updates accruals as matters progress over time. It is reasonably possible that some of the matters for which accruals have not been established could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require recognizing future expenditures. Also, statutes of limitations could expire without the Company paying the taxes for matters for which accruals have been established, which could result in the recognition of future gains upon reversal of these accruals at that time. 



The Company has challenged multiple customs rulings in Thailand seeking to retroactively collect customs duties on previous imports of automated teller machines (ATMs). In August 2017 and March 2019, the Supreme Court of Thailand ruled in the Company's favor in two of the matters, finding that Thailand customs' attempt to collect duties for importation of ATMs was improper. The surviving matters remain at various stages of the appeals process and the Company will use the Supreme Court's decisions in support of its position in those matters. Management remains confident that the Company has a valid legal position in these appeals. Accordingly, the Company does not have any amount accrued for this contingency.

A loss contingency is reasonably possible if it has a more than remote but less than probable chance of occurring. Although management believes the Company has valid defenses with respect to its indirect tax positions, it is reasonably possible that a loss could occur in excess of the estimated accrual. The Company estimated the aggregate risk at September 30, 2019 to be up to $109.4 for its material indirect tax matters, of which $28.0 related to the Thailand customs matter disclosed above. The aggregate risk related to indirect taxes is adjusted as the applicable statutes of limitations expire.

Legal Contingencies

At September 30, 2019, the Company was a party to several lawsuits that were incurred in the normal course of business, which neither individually nor in the aggregate were considered material by management in relation to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. In management’s opinion, the Company's consolidated financial statements would not be materially affected by the outcome of these legal proceedings, commitments or asserted claims.


Diebold KGaA is a party to two separate appraisal proceedings (Spruchverfahren) in connection with the purchase of all shares in its former listed subsidiary, Diebold Nixdorf AG. Both proceedings are pending at the same Chamber for Commercial Matters (Kammer für Handelssachen) at the District Court (Landgericht) of Dortmund (Germany). The first appraisal proceeding relates to the DPLTA entered into by Diebold KGaA and former Diebold Nixdorf AG, which became effective on February 17, 2017. The DPLTA appraisal proceeding was filed by minority shareholders of Diebold Nixdorf AG challenging the adequacy of both the cash

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)



exit compensation of €55.02 per Diebold Nixdorf AG share (of which 6,939,451 shares were then outstanding) and the annual recurring compensation of €2.82 per Diebold Nixdorf AG share offered in connection with the DPLTA.

The second appraisal proceeding relates to the cash merger squeeze-out of minority shareholders of Diebold Nixdorf AG in 2019. The squeeze-out appraisal proceeding was filed by minority shareholders of Diebold Nixdorf AG challenging the adequacy of the cash exit compensation of €54.80 per Diebold Nixdorf AG share (of which 1,367,644 shares were then outstanding) in connection with the merger squeeze-out. 

In both appraisal proceedings, a court ruling would apply to all Diebold Nixdorf AG shares outstanding at the time when the DPLTA or the merger squeeze-out, respectively, became effective. Any cash compensation received by former Diebold Nixdorf AG shareholders in connection with the merger squeeze-out would be netted with any higher cash compensation such shareholder may still claim in connection with the DPLTA appraisal proceeding. While the Company believes that the compensation offered in connection with the DPLTA and the merger squeeze-out was in both cases fair, it notes that German courts often adjudicate increases of the cash compensation to plaintiffs in varying amounts in connection with German appraisal proceedings. Therefore, the Company cannot rule out that the first instance court or an appellate court may increase the cash compensation also in these appraisal proceedings. The Company, however, is convinced that its defense in both appraisal proceedings which are still at preliminary stages is supported by strong sets of facts and the Company will continue to vigorously defend itself in these matters.

In July and August 2019, shareholders filed putative class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal securities laws in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and the Northern District of Ohio. The lawsuits collectively assert that the Company and three former officers made material misstatements regarding the Company’s business and operations, causing the Company’s common stock to be overvalued during from February 14, 2017 to August 1, 2018. The Company anticipates that these lawsuits, along with any other potential lawsuits addressing the same topic, will be consolidated into one action. The Company denies any liability, believes the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters.

Net non-routine expense consists of items that the Company has determined are non-routine in nature and not allocated to the reportable operating segments. Net non-routine expense of $23.5 and $98.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, primarily consisted of purchase accounting pre-tax charges for amortization of acquired intangibles of $22.8 and $71.8, respectively, and the loss (gain) on sale of assets, net. Net non-routine expense of $175.9 and $342.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, was primarily due to goodwill impairment charges of $134.4 and $217.5, respectively, acquisition integration expenses of $10.3 and $40.0, respectively, primarily within selling and administrative expense, and purchase accounting pre-tax charges for amortization of acquired intangibles of $28.1 and $88.6, respectively.

Contract balances



Contract assets are minimal for the periods presented. The amount of revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, mainly due to the changes in the estimate of variable consideration and contract modifications was de minimis. There have been $0.4 and $9.7 during the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $3.3 and $20.6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of impairment losses recognized as bad debt related to receivables or contract assets arising from the Company's contracts with customers.

As of January 1, 2019, the Company had $378.2 of unrecognized deferred revenue constituting the remaining performance obligations that are either unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied). During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $247.9 related to the Company's deferred revenue balance at January 1, 2019.

Contract assets are the rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Contract assets of the Company primarily relate to the Company's rights to consideration for goods shipped and services provided but not contractually billable at the reporting date.

The contract assets are reclassified into the receivables balance when the rights to receive payment become unconditional. Contract liabilities are recorded for any services billed to customers and not yet recognizable if the contract period has commenced or for the amount collected from customers in advance of the contract period commencing. In addition, contract liabilities are recorded as advanced payments for products and other deliverables that are billed to and collected from customers prior to revenue being recognizable.

Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations

As of September 30, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $1,700. The Company generally expects to recognize revenue on the remaining performance obligations over the next twelve months. The Company enters into service agreements with cancellable terms after a certain period without penalty. Unsatisfied obligations reflect only the obligation during the initial term. The Company applies the practical expedient in ASC paragraph 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. 








Each guarantor subsidiary is 100 percent owned by the Parent Company at the date of each balance sheet presented. The 2024 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each guarantor subsidiary. The guarantees of the guarantor subsidiaries are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain conditions. Each entity in the consolidating financial information follows the same accounting policies as described in the condensed consolidated financial statements, except for the use by the Parent Company and the guarantor subsidiaries of the equity method of accounting to reflect ownership interests in subsidiaries which are eliminated upon consolidation. Changes in intercompany receivables and payables related to operations, such as intercompany sales or service charges, are included in cash flows from operating activities. Intercompany transactions reported as investing or financing activities include the sale of capital stock of various subsidiaries, loans and other capital transactions between members of the consolidated group. 


The Company also reclassified certain assets and liabilities for inclusion of an additional wholly-owned domestic subsidiary from its non-guarantor subsidiaries to the combined guarantor subsidiaries as a result of changes included in the Sixth Amendment.

By executing on these and other operational improvement activities, the Company expects to increase customer intimacy and satisfaction, while providing career enrichment opportunities for employees and enhancing value for shareholders.

Segments

The Company’s operating structure is focused on its two customer segments — Banking and Retail. Leveraging a broad portfolio of solutions, the Company offers its clients the flexibility to purchase the combination of services, software and systems that drive the most value to their business. 

For example, the Company offers end-to-end branch and store automation solutions that consist of the complete value chain of consult, design, build and operate. Branch and store automation helps financial institutions and retailers grow revenue, reduce costs, and increase convenience and security for their customers by migrating routine transactions, typically done inside the branch or store, to lower-cost automated channels. The Company collaborates with its clients to define the ideal customer experience, modify processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technologies that meet business objectives.

Banking

The Company provides integrated solutions for financial institutions of all sizes designed to help drive operational efficiencies, differentiate the consumer experience, grow revenue and manage risk. Banking operations are managed within two geographic regions. The Eurasia region includes the developed economies of Western Europe as well as the emerging economies of Eastern Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The Americas region encompasses the United States (U.S.), Canada, Mexico, Central and South America.

For banking clients, services represents the largest operational component of the Company. Diebold Nixdorf AllConnect ServicesSM was launched in 2018 to power the business operations of financial institutions of all sizes. This as-a-service offering provides financial institutions with the capabilities and technology needed to make physical distribution channels as agile, integrated, efficient and differentiated as their digital counterparts by leveraging a data-driven Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure. The Company’s product-related services resolve incidents through remote service capabilities or an on-site visit. The portfolio includes first and second line maintenance, preventive maintenance, “on-demand” and total implementation services. 

Managed services and outsourcing consists of managing the end-to-end business processes, technology integration and day-to-day operation of the self-service channel and the bank branch. Our integrated business solutions include self-service fleet management, branch life-cycle management and ATM as-a-service capabilities.

From a product perspective, the banking portfolio consists of cash recyclers and dispensers, intelligent deposit terminals, teller automation and kiosk technologies, as well as physical security solutions. The Company assists financial institutions to increase the functionality, availability and security within their ATM fleet. 

Earlier in the year, the Company introduced the DN Series of ATMs, a family of self-service solutions designed to anticipate the needs of a progressively transforming industry. These holistic, digitally-connected solutions are built upon an integrated software and services model and provided a modern and personalized experience for consumers, while delivering maximum efficiency and reliability for financial institutions.


•Improved ATM availability and performance;

•Higher note capacity and processing power with next-generation cash recycling technology;

•Improved security in a smaller footprint;

•Full integration with the DN Vynamic software suite;

•Technological capability that facilitates a streamlined, simplified product portfolio; and

•Modular and upgradeable design, enabling a simplified and streamlined internal supply chain

The Company’s software encompasses front-end applications for consumer connection points as well as back-end platforms which manage channel transactions, operations and channel integration. These hardware-agnostic software

applications facilitate millions of transactions via ATMs, kiosks, and other self-service devices, as well as via online and mobile digital channels. 

The Company's DN Vynamic software is the first end-to-end Connected Commerce software portfolio in the banking marketplace designed to simplify and enhance the consumer experience. In addition, DN Vynamic suite's open application program interface (API) architecture is built to simplify operations by eliminating the traditional focus on internal silos and enabling tomorrow's inter-connected partnerships between financial institutions and payment providers. In addition, with a shared analytic and transaction engine, the DN Vynamic platform can generate new insights to enhance operations across any channel — putting consumer preferences, not the technology, at the heart of the experience. 

An important enabler of the Company’s software offerings are the professional service employees who provide systems integration, customization, project management and consulting. The Company's advisory services team collaborates with customers to refine the end-user experience, improve business processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technology to automate both branches and stores.

Retail

The Company’s comprehensive portfolio of retail solutions, software and services improves the checkout process for retailers while enhancing shopping experiences for consumers.

Gross Profit



Services gross margin increased 5.1 percent and 3.5 percent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. Both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were favorably impacted by lower restructuring charges of $2.8 and $0.4, respectively, and lower non-routine charges of $0.8 and $2.4, respectively. Excluding restructuring and non-routine charges, services gross margin increased 5.5 percent and 3.6 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, as services margin increased in the Eurasia banking segment related to the favorable impact of the services modernization initiatives and favorable mix of higher margin installation activity. The nine months ended September 30, 2018, was unfavorably impacted by one-time banking services cost in Brazil.

Product gross margin increased 4.2 percent and 3.9 percent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. Both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were favorably impacted by lower restructuring charges of $3.8 and $3.9, respectively. Both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were favorably impacted by lower non-routine charges of $5.7 and $19.0, respectively, primarily related to lower purchase accounting amortization and gain on a product inventory provision, partially offset by the reversal of a Brazil indirect tax accrual in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding the impact of restructuring and non-routine charges, products gross margin increased 2.0 percent and 2.1 percent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher volume and a more favorable solution mix in Brazil and Canada along with higher margin Windows 10 upgrades in parts of Europe. Additionally, product gross margin improved from the Company's focus on higher margin product mix in Eurasia and Latin America as well as improved supply chain management and lower expedited freight costs in the Americas.

Operating Expenses




Selling and administrative expense increased in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 by $1.9 and $4.5, respectively. Excluding lower incremental restructuring of $22.2 and lower non-routine charges of $0.8, the three months ended September 30, 2019 expense increase $24.2. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, excluding lower incremental

restructuring of $19.6 and higher non-routine charges of $16.4, the expense increased $7.0. The increase in selling and administrative expense for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 is primarily attributable to an increase in annual incentive plan cost and an unfavorable impact of the mark-to-market adjustment of the legacy Wincor Nixdorf stock option program partially offset by the cost reduction initiatives tied to the DN Now program.

Non-routine cost in selling and administrative expense was $34.5 and $126.3 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, a decrease of $0.8 and and an increase of $16.4, respectively, compared to the prior-year periods. The lower non-routine costs in the three months ended September 30, 2019 consisted of lower integration expense and purchase accounting adjustments partially offset by increased DN Now transformation expense. The nine months ended September 30, 2019 consisted of increased DN Now transformation expense, a one-time non-cash item in Brazil and $5.6 related to the German real estate tax from the squeeze out in the first quarter of 2019. These increases were partially offset by lower integration expense and purchase accounting adjustments. Selling and administrative expense included restructuring charges of $6.4 and $13.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, or $22.2 and $19.6, respectively, lower than the prior-year periods, related to the workforce alignment under the DN Now plan.

Research, development and engineering expense in the three months ended September 30, 2019 decreased $0.2 including a net favorable currency impact of $0.9, primarily related to the euro. In the nine months ended September 30, 2019, research, development and engineering expense decreased $9.1 including a net favorable currency impact of $4.7. Excluding the impact of currency, research, development and engineering expense decreased $1.1 and $13.8, respectively, due primarily to lower headcount tied to the Company’s DN Now restructuring program, partially offset by increased software development cost.

The Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $134.4 and $217.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.

In the three months ended September 30, 2019, the gain on sale of assets primarily relates to the Kony transaction. The nine months ended September 30, 2019 included the loss of the Venezuela business and losses from the divestiture and liquidation of non-core businesses in Eurasia. The gain of $6.8 in the prior-year period was primarily related to the sale of a building in North America and the liquidation of the Barbados operating entity.

Operating expense as a percent of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2019 decreased 11.8 percent to 23.0 percent compared to the same period in 2018 and decreased 6.1 percent to 24.3 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The decreases were due primarily from the impairment charges in 2018.

Operating Profit (Loss)




The operating profit increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The change is primarily due to higher product gross profit in the Americas and Eurasia banking segments from large roll out and upgrade projects and the higher impairment charges in 2018, partially offset by the increase in the loss on sale of assets in 2019.

Other Income (Expense)



Interest income was relatively flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. Interest expense increased $7.3 and $53.7 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the same prior-year periods due to the incurrence of the additional $650.0 of Term Loan A-1 Facility debt with higher incremental interest rates and related fee amortization. Miscellaneous net, decreased $0.5 and $1.5 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, impacted by lower costs associated with the company owned life insurance.

Net Loss



The loss before taxes and net loss decreased primarily due to the reasons described above. Net loss was also impacted by the change in the income tax expense.

The effective tax rate on the loss from continuing operations was (17.2) percent for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and (50.8) percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The expense on the loss was primarily due to the tax impacts of the Tax Act on the estimated projected tax rate, more specifically, the impacts related to GILTI and BEAT. In addition, during the first quarter the Company collapsed its Barbados structure to meet the covenant requirements under its credit agreement, which resulted in additional discrete tax expense of $48.4 inclusive of the offsetting valuation allowance release relating to the Company’s nondeductible interest expense that was carried forward from December 31, 2018. No taxes are currently payable related to the collapse of the Barbados structure. The above items noted as well as the Company’s jurisdictional income (loss) mix and varying statutory rates are the primary drivers of the estimated projected tax rate. 

The Company’s actual effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 included the U.S. federal tax effects attributable to tax provision to return adjustments related to the Company’s 2018 U.S. federal tax return and the amendment of the 2015 U.S. federal return. As of September 30, 2019, the Company has not completed the 2018 U.S. federal tax return filing. However, upon further analysis of certain aspects of the Tax Act and refinements to the Company’s calculations, the Company recognized a tax expense of $6.4 related to the 2018 tax year. Additionally, during Q3 2019 the Company amended its 2015 U.S. federal tax return and recognized tax expense of $2.8 related to the reduction of various foreign tax credit carryforwards. Both increases to U.S. federal tax expense have been reported as discrete items for the period ended September 30, 2019. The Company will finalize its 2018 tax provision to return adjustments in the periods in which the Company files its tax returns on foreign and state jurisdictions. The final impact of the tax provision to return adjustments may differ as additional guidance and information becomes available.

DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES



Also included in tax expense is $2.3 of anticipated taxes related to the Company’s change in indefinite reinvestment assertion on undistributed earnings of a certain subsidiary. 

The effective tax rate on the loss before taxes was (22.3) percent for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and (8.5) percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The expense on the loss for the three months ended and nine months ended was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge, the impacts of the Tax Act and the higher interest expense burden resulting from the debt restructuring. More specifically, the expense on the loss reflects refinement of the transition tax, the impacts related to GILTI and the business interest deduction limitation which, as a result of the Company’s debt restructuring activities during the quarter, required a full valuation allowance on the current year nondeductible business interest expense. In addition, the benefit on the losses for the nine months is reduced by the goodwill impairment charge, which for tax purposes is primarily nondeductible, of $134.4 and $83.1 incurred in the third and second quarter, respectively. 

Segment Net Sales and Operating Profit Summary




For the three months ended September 30, 2019, Eurasia Banking net sales decreased $29.1, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $14.0, related primarily to the euro, and divestitures of $7.9. Excluding currency and the impact of divestitures, net sales decreased $7.3 largely driven by services revenue decreased primarily due to lower installation services activity. Partially offsetting the services decrease, higher product revenue from increased volume in Germany, the Middle East and South Africa as a result of Windows 10 upgrades and other product enhancements.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, Eurasia Banking net sales decreased $88.9, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $71.6 related primarily to the euro and divestitures of $18.2. Excluding currency and the impact of divestitures, net sales increased $0.9 primarily due to higher product volume in Germany, the Middle East and South Africa related to unit replacements from Windows 10 upgrades. These increases were partially offset by decreased services revenue from a low-margin maintenance contract roll off with a particular customer in India as well as lower professional services activity in Germany and lower service volume in the U.K.

Segment operating profit decreased $2.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2019 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $2.2. Excluding the impact of currency, operating profit decreased $0.4 for the three months September 30, 2019 related to lower project volume. Segment operating profit increased $32.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $9.1, primarily due to the euro. Excluding the impact of currency, operating profit increased $41.3 for the nine months September 30, 2019 due in part to higher gross margins on services and products as well as lower selling and administrative expenses. The favorable services margin was primarily attributable to the services modernization program which benefited numerous countries in Europe and Asia, while products margin also benefited from DN Now initiatives, higher volume as well as favorable country and product mix. Additionally, segment operating profit benefited from lower operating expenses tied to DN Now initiatives, restructuring programs and the phase out of non-profitable service contracts in India.

Segment operating profit margin remained flat for the three months. Segment operating profit increased 3.1 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, despite lower net sales, as a result of higher services and products gross margin and lower operating expense primarily attributable to DN Now initiatives.

For the three months ended September 30, 2019, Americas Banking net sales increased $21.2, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $0.4 related to the Canada dollar and Brazil real. Excluding currency and the impact of a small divestiture, net sales increased $22.4 primarily due to increased product volume and related service installation revenue from unit replacements from Windows 10 upgrades in Brazil, Mexico and Canada slightly offset by lower maintenance revenue in the U.S. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, Americas Banking net sales increased $99.5, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $9.5 related to the Brazil real. Excluding currency and a small divestiture, net sales increased $112.0 driven primarily by product sales in Canada, Brazil, Mexico and the U.S regional customers related to unit replacements from Windows 10 upgrades. Partially offsetting the increases, services revenue declined from lower maintenance contract volume and billed work activity in the U.S.

Segment operating profit increased $27.2 and $76.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, mostly from DN Now initiatives favorably impacting both cost of sales and operating expense. Gross profit was favorably impacted by current large product refresh projects in Canada and favorable solution mix in the U.S., Brazil and Latin America. Additionally, the Company made improvements to supply chain management resulting in lower expedited freight costs. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were unfavorably impacted by one-time banking services cost in Brazil. 

Segment operating profit margin increased 6.7 percent and 6.4 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, primarily as a result of higher product gross margin, in addition to lower cost related to the DN Now initiatives. 


For the three months ended September 30, 2019, Retail net sales decreased $32.3, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $11.8 mostly related to the euro and divestitures of $4.3. Excluding currency and the impact of divestitures, net sales decreased $16.1 primarily from lower POS volume in Europe which was partially offset by growth in SCO. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, Retail net sales decreased $42.3, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $51.4 mostly related to the euro and divestitures of $14.1. Excluding currency and the impact of divestitures, net sales increased $23.2 primarily from higher product volume driven by incremental reverse vending and SCO projects.

Segment operating profit decreased $4.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $0.8. Excluding the impact of currency, segment operating profit decreased $4.1 due to lower product volume in the U.S. and Brazil. Segment operating profit increased $3.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $3.7. Excluding the impact of currency, segment operating profit increased $6.8 as lower costs and expenses tied to DN Now initiatives as well as higher volume and favorable service mix related to maintenance and support activities in Europe. 

Segment operating profit margin decreased 1.1 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2019 primarily related to lower product volume. Segment operating profit increased 0.6 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily from lower costs and expenses tied to DN Now initiatives as well as higher volume and favorable service mix related to maintenance and support activities in Europe.

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $15.3 to $171.3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $186.6 during the same period in 2018 primarily due to a reduction in capital spend. Share-based compensation decreased $7.8 to $19.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to a reduction in shares awarded in 2019.

Investing Activities

The maturities and purchases of investments primarily relate to short-term investment activity in Brazil. The $79.9 change was primarily due to the monetization of the Company's investment in the company owned life insurance plans in the third quarter of 2018 and a reduction in utilization of short-term investments in Brazil for cash needs as well as a reduction in the Company's capital spend.

Financing Activities 

Net cash used by financing activities was $184.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $196.9 for the nine months ended 2018, an increase in use of $381.8. The change was primarily related to the Term Loan A-1 Facility proceeds in August 2018 partially offset by the redemption of shares and cash compensation to Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders of $98.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $337.8 in the prior-year period. Additionally, there was a decrease in net borrowings (repayments) under the Company's revolving facility as a result of favorable operating cash flow in the nine-month period ending September 30, 2019 compared to the prior year.

Refer to note 11 for additional information regarding the Company's debt obligations. The Company paid cash for interest related to its debt of $130.5 and $66.8 in the nine months ended September 2019 and 2018, respectively.

As of September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial and other covenants in its debt agreements.

Refer to note 17 for additional information regarding the Company's hedging and derivative instruments.

Dividends The Company paid dividends of $7.7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

As a result, there was no dividend for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

Contractual Obligations In the first half of 2019, the Company entered into purchase commitments due within one year for materials through contract manufacturing agreements for a total negotiated price. At September 30, 2019, the Company had purchase commitments due within one year totaling $0.1 for materials through contract manufacturing agreements at negotiated prices.

Except for the items noted above, all contractual cash obligations with initial and remaining terms in excess of one year and contingent liabilities remained generally unchanged at September 30, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various arrangements not recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets that have or could have an effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include revenue recognition, the valuation of trade, finance lease receivables, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, guarantee obligations and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, pension and post-retirement benefits and customer incentives, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors. Management monitors the economic conditions and other factors and will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 

In addition to the items that the Company disclosed as its critical accounting policies and estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02 and its subsequent amendments related to lease accounting. The standard requires that a lessee recognize on its balance sheet ROU assets and corresponding liabilities resulting from leasing transactions, as well as additional financial statement disclosures. Previously, U.S. GAAP only required balance sheet recognition for leases classified as capital leases. The provisions of this update apply to substantially all leased assets. Subsequent ASUs related to this standard are updates, which prescribe a practical expedient for implementation and narrow-scope improvements for lessors. For more information regarding the implementation of this standard, refer to note 2.

FORM 10-Q as of September 30, 2019


Item 4: Controls and Procedures

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q includes the certifications of the Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) required by Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2. This Item 4 includes information concerning the controls and control evaluations referred to in those certifications.

Based on the performance of procedures by management, designed to ensure the reliability of financial reporting, management believes that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

In connection with the preparation of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the Company's management, under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2019 due to the material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as described below.

A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 and notes that the material weaknesses were not remediated as of September 30, 2019.

The Company’s risk assessment process was not effective in considering changes to the business operations, personnel and other factors affecting certain financial reporting processes and design of related controls on a timely basis. Accordingly,

•The Company had ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) related to IT systems used for financial reporting by certain entities throughout the organization. The Company did not establish effective IT and financial user access controls commensurate with certain job responsibilities. Consequently, automated and manual process level controls over financial reporting which were dependent upon these ITGCs were also ineffective.

•The Company had ineffective implementation and operation of controls over inventory valuation related to spare parts and finished goods from canceled orders as the Company did not effectively communicate information to certain locations to allow for the effective operations or implementation of these controls.

•The Company had ineffective controls over non-routine transactions as certain controls were not designed at the appropriate level of precision to ensure calculations supporting non-routine transactions were calculated correctly.

Because of the material weaknesses identified above, a reasonable possibility exists that a material misstatement in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

FORM 10-Q as of September 30, 2019



•Improving our continuous risk assessment process to be responsive to changes in the business operations, personnel and IT developments affecting our financial reporting and related controls;

•Improving our timely written communication of changes in financial reporting and related controls affecting both business and financial users;

•Revoking the access to IT systems of those individuals that were identified as inappropriate;


•Implementing consistent inventory valuation controls at all locations and communicating the requirements for effectively operating such controls to all businesses; and

•Implementing controls over calculations associated with non-routine transactions at a more precise level of operation.

Change in Internal Controls


•We performed a full user access review of IT users, and as a result, revoked access that was concluded to be inappropriate;

•We refined our accounting policy and procedures related to inventory valuation, communicated the changes to the impacted finance personnel at our global locations, and conducted training to emphasize and reinforce the changes that were made; and

•We refined our procedures around calculations associated with non-routine transactions, including the related underlying inputs and assumptions utilized in making the calculations.

Further execution of key controls and testing to be conducted through the balance of 2019 and early 2020 will determine whether these changes will prove effective in remediating the respective underlying material weaknesses.

There have been no other changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
