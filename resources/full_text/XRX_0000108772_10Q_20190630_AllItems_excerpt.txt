NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)


Note 1 – Basis of Presentation

References herein to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “company” and “Xerox” refer to Xerox Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context suggests otherwise.

We have prepared the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the accounting policies described in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K ("2018 Annual Report") except as noted herein, and the interim reporting requirements of Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in our annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. You should read these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2018 Annual Report.

In our opinion, all adjustments, which are necessary for a fair statement of financial position, operating results and cash flows for the interim periods presented, have been made. These adjustments consist of normal recurring items. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results of the full year.

For convenience and ease of reference, we refer to the financial statement caption “Income before Income Taxes and Equity Income” as “pre-tax income.” 

Corporate Reorganization

On March 6, 2019, the Xerox Board of Directors approved a reorganization (the “Reorganization”) of the Company's corporate structure into a holding company structure. The Reorganization was subject to the approval of shareholders, which was obtained at the annual shareholders meeting held May 21, 2019.

On July 31, 2019, Xerox completed the Reorganization, pursuant to which Xerox became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox Holdings Corporation ("Xerox Holdings"). The business operations, directors and executive officers of the Company did not change as a result of the Reorganization.

In this Reorganization, shareholders of Xerox (the predecessor publicly held parent company) became shareholders of Xerox Holdings on a one-for-one basis; maintaining the same number of shares and ownership percentage as held in Xerox immediately prior to the Reorganization. In addition, the individual holder of the shares of Xerox’s Series B Preferred Stock exchanged those shares for the same number of shares of Xerox Holdings Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Xerox Holdings Series A Preferred Stock has the same designations, rights, powers and preferences, and the same qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the shares of Xerox Series B Preferred Stock, with the addition of certain voting rights. In connection with the Reorganization, Xerox Holdings assumed each of the Xerox stock plans, all unexercised and unexpired options to purchase Xerox common stock and each right to acquire or vest in a share of Xerox common stock, including restricted stock unit awards, performance share awards and deferred stock units that are outstanding under the Xerox stock plans. In addition, Xerox Holdings became a guarantor of Xerox’s existing Credit Facility.

The Reorganization was accounted for as a transaction among entities under common control and is expected to be a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Shares of Xerox Holdings common stock will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the current ticker symbol “XRX”, formerly used by Xerox. 

Subsequent to the Reorganization, Xerox Holdings contributed the Xerox Series B Preferred Stock it held to Xerox in exchange for additional capital and Xerox subsequently extinguished the Series B Preferred Stock. The contribution and extinguishment were recorded at carrying value. In addition, the capital structure of Xerox was modified such that its issued and outstanding common shares now held by Xerox Holdings were exchanged for 1,000 shares of Xerox $1 par value common stock. Accordingly, we reclassified approximately $221 from Xerox’s Common stock to Additional paid-in capital. 

Since the Reorganization was completed after the end of the second quarter 2019, or June 30, 2019, the accompanying financial statements presented in this filing for both Xerox and Xerox Holdings reflect their ownership structure and consolidated results prior to the Reorganization, or as of June 30, 2019. 

Xerox Holdings was formed on March 8, 2019. There was no income statement activity for Xerox Holdings since formation through the period ended June 30, 2019 and thus, no income statement is provided.

Shared Services Arrangement with HCL Technologies

In March 2019, as part of Project Own It, we entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we are outsourcing certain global administrative and support functions, including, among others, selected information technology and finance functions (excluding accounting). The transition of these functions to HCL is expected to take up to 18 months. HCL is expected to make certain up-front and ongoing investments in software, tools and other technology to consolidate, optimize and automate the transferred functions with the goal of providing improved service levels and significant cost savings. The shared services arrangement with HCL includes a total aggregate spending commitment by us of approximately $1.3 billion over the next 7 years. However, we can terminate the arrangement at any time at our discretion, subject to payment of termination fees that decline over the term or for cause. The spending commitment excludes restructuring and related costs we are expected to incur in connection with the transition of the contemplated functions - refer to Note 12 - Restructuring Programs for additional information. The transfer of employees associated with the HCL arrangement in certain countries is subject to compliance with works council and other employment regulatory requirements in those countries, which may delay the transfer as well as the expected savings from the arrangement. 

During the second quarter 2019, we incurred net charges of approximately $30 associated with this arrangement, which only reflects the cost associated with the employees transferred to date. The cost has been allocated to the various functional expense lines in the Condensed Consolidated Income Statement based on an assessment of the nature and amount of the costs incurred for the various transferred functions prior to their transfer to HCL.

Change in Presentation

During first quarter 2019, we realigned portions of our business to support our new revenue strategy. This realignment included the combination and consolidation of certain sales units to better service customers consistently across the company. In connection with that realignment, we changed the classification of revenues and related costs from certain service arrangements to consistently conform the presentation of those amounts among our various business units. Prior year amounts were also revised as follows to conform to the 2019 presentation. 



The revised presentation does not impact Total Revenues, Total Costs and Expenses or Net Income.

Note 2 – Recent Accounting Pronouncements


Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, with additional updates being issued in 2018 and 2019. This update requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets. The update impacts financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through Net Income. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Intangibles - Internal-Use Software 

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract. This update aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). The update provides criteria for determining which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense. The capitalized implementation costs are required to be expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement. The update also clarifies the presentation requirements for reporting such costs in the entity’s financial statements. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2018-15 on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.


Leases

On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC Topic 842). This update, as well as additional amendments and targeted improvements issued in 2018 and early 2019, supersedes existing lease accounting guidance found under ASC 840, Leases (“ASC 840”) and requires the recognition of right-to-use assets and lease obligations by lessees for those leases originally classified as operating leases under prior lease guidance. Effective with the adoption, leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. Short term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not required to be recognized. The update also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosure of key information regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements to increase transparency and comparability among companies. The accounting for lessors does not fundamentally change with this update except for changes to conform and align guidance to the lessee guidance, as well as to the revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09. Some of these conforming changes, such as those related to the definition of lease term and minimum lease payments, resulted in certain lease arrangements, that would have been previously accounted for as operating leases, to be classified and accounted for as sales-type leases with a corresponding up-front recognition of equipment sales revenue. 

Upon adoption we applied the transition option, whereby prior comparative periods are not retrospectively presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We also elected the package of practical expedients not to reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs and the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for certain asset classes (real estate lease arrangements for offices and warehouses). Additionally, we made a policy election to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases for all asset classes. We elected the package of practical expedients from both the Lessee and Lessor prospective, to the extent applicable. 

Lessee accounting - the adoption of this update resulted in an increase to assets and related liabilities of approximately $385 (approximately $440 undiscounted) primarily related to leases of facilities. Lessor accounting - the adoption of this update resulted in an increase to equipment sales of approximately $11 in 2019 as compared to 2018. 

Refer to Note 3 - Adoption of New Leasing Standard - Xerox as a Lessee and Note 4 - Adoption of New Leasing Standard - Xerox as a Lessor for additional transitional disclosures related to the adoption of this standard.

Note 3 – Adoption of New Leasing Standard - Xerox as a Lessee

Refer to Note 2 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements - Leases, for additional information related to the adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC Topic 842).



Operating leases are included in Other long-term assets, Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in Land, buildings and equipment, net, Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since the implicit rate for most of our leases is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments, in a similar economic environment and over a similar term. The rate is dependent on several factors, including the lease term and currency of the lease payments.

Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

Lease terms used to calculate the present value of lease payments generally do not include any options to extend, renew, or terminate the lease, as we do not have reasonable certainty at lease inception that these options will be exercised. We generally consider the economic life of our operating lease ROU assets to be comparable to the useful life of similar owned assets. We have elected the short-term lease exception, therefore operating lease ROU assets and liabilities do not include leases with a lease term of twelve months or less. Our leases generally do not provide a residual guarantee. The operating lease ROU asset also excludes lease incentives. 

Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. These components are accounted for separately for vehicle and equipment leases. We account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for real estate leases of offices and warehouses. 

We review the impairment of our ROU assets consistent with the approach applied for our other long-lived assets. We review the recoverability of our long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows of the related operations. We have elected to include the carrying amount of operating lease liabilities in any tested asset group and include the associated operating lease payments in the undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows.

Operating Leases





Variable lease expense is related to our leased real estate for offices and warehouses and primarily includes labor and operational costs as well as taxes and insurance. 







Includes the impact of new leases as well as remeasurements and modifications to existing leases.

Finance Leases

Xerox has one finance lease for equipment and related infrastructure within an outsourced warehouse supply arrangement in the U.S. The lease expires in December 2023 and has a remaining lease obligation of $7 as of June 30, 2019 based on a discount rate of 4.07%. The Right-of-use asset balance associated with this finance lease of $8 is included in Land, buildings and equipment, net in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Prior Period Disclosures under ASC 840

For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, operating lease expense, net of sublease income, were $147 and $161, respectively.

The following represent updated disclosures to our Revenue Recognition policies as a result of the adoption of ASC Topic 842. 


Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

The remainder of any fixed payments, as well as the variable payments, are allocated to non-lease elements because the variable consideration for incremental page volume or usage is considered attributable to the delivery of those elements. The consideration for the non-lease elements is not dependent on the consideration for equipment and vice versa and the consideration for the equipment and services is priced at the appropriate standalone values; therefore, the relative standalone selling price allocation method is not necessary. The revenue associated with the non-lease elements are normally accounted for as a single performance obligation being delivered in a series with delivery being measured as the usage billed to the customer. Accordingly, revenue from these agreements is recognized in a manner consistent with the guidance for Maintenance and Services agreements. 


We consider the economic life of most of our products to be five years, since this represents the most frequent contractual lease term for our principal products and only a small percentage of our leases are for original terms longer than five years. There is no significant after-market for our used equipment. We believe five years is representative of the period during which the equipment is expected to be economically usable, with normal service, for the purpose for which it is intended.

We perform an analysis of the stand-alone selling price of equipment based on cash selling prices during the applicable period. The cash selling prices are compared to the range of values determined for our leases. The range of cash selling prices must be reasonably consistent with the lease selling prices in order for us to determine that such lease prices reflects stand-alone value. 

Our lease pricing interest rates, which are used in determining customer payments in a bundled lease arrangement, are developed based upon a variety of factors including local prevailing rates in the marketplace and the customer’s credit history, industry and credit class. We reassess our pricing interest rates quarterly based on changes in the local prevailing rates in the marketplace. The pricing interest rates generally equal the implicit rates within the leases, as corroborated by our comparisons of cash to lease selling prices noted above.






Profit at lease commencement on sales type leases was estimated to be approximately $55 and $70 for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and approximately $120 and $145 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Table of Contents 

We may also incur costs associated with our services arrangements to generate or enhance resources and assets that will be used to satisfy our future performance obligations included in these arrangements. These costs are considered contract fulfillment costs and are amortized over the contractual service period of the arrangement to cost of services. In addition, we also provide inducements to certain customers in various forms, including contractual credits, which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 amounts deferred associated with contract fulfillment costs and inducements were $12 and $12, respectively. The related amortization for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was $2 and $2, respective and $3 and $3 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Note 6 – Acquisitions

Xerox is focused on increasing its Small and Mid-sized (SMB) coverage through resellers and partners (including multi-brand dealers) and continued distribution acquisitions. During the second quarter of 2019, acquisitions totaled $38 and included Rabbit Copiers, Inc. (Rabbit Office Automation (ROA)), a San Francisco Bay area dealer, and Heritage Business Systems, Inc. (HBS), a Delaware Valley dealer. Both dealers expand our distribution and increase the number of resources in these geographies and provide office technology sales, services and supplies in those markets.

The operating results of these acquisitions are not material to our financial statements and are included within our results from the acquisition date. The purchase prices were all cash for 100% ownership of the acquired companies and were primarily allocated to Intangible assets, net and Goodwill. The allocations were based on preliminary management estimates, which are expected to be updated in third quarter 2019 and in certain situations may include input from third-party valuations. Any adjustments to the allocations are not expected to be material.

Restricted cash primarily relates to escrow cash deposits made in Brazil associated with ongoing litigation. As more fully discussed in Note 21 - Contingencies and Litigation, various litigation matters in Brazil require us to make cash deposits to escrow as a condition of continuing the litigation. Restricted cash amounts are classified in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets based on when the cash is expected to be contractually or judicially released.

Note 8 – Accounts Receivable, Net



Amounts to be invoiced in the subsequent quarter for current services provided are included in amounts accrued.

We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is determined principally on the basis of past collection experience as well as consideration of current economic conditions and changes in our customer collection trends. 

Accounts Receivable Sales Arrangements 

Accounts receivable sales arrangements are utilized in the normal course of business as part of our cash and liquidity management. The accounts receivable sold are generally short-term trade receivables with payment due dates of less than 60 days. We have one facility in Europe that enables us to sell accounts receivable associated with our distributor network on an ongoing basis, without recourse. Under this arrangement, we sell our entire interest in the related accounts receivable for cash and no portion of the payment is held back or deferred by the purchaser.

Of the accounts receivable sold and derecognized from our balance sheet, $131 and $131 remained uncollected as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 




Customers may also enter into structured-payable arrangements that require us to sell our receivables from that customer to a third-party financial institution, which then makes payments to us to settle the customer's receivable. In these instances, we ensure the sale of the receivables are bankruptcy-remote and the payment made to us is without recourse. The activity associated with these arrangements is not reflected in this disclosure, as payments under these arrangements have not been material and these are customer directed arrangements.

Note 9 - Finance Receivables, Net

Finance receivables include sales-type leases and installment loans arising from the marketing of our equipment. These receivables are typically collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets.

Note 14 – Financial Instruments

Interest Rate Risk Management

We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure and to achieve a desired proportion of variable and fixed rate debt. These derivatives may be designated as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges depending on the nature of the risk being hedged.

Fair Value Hedges 




Foreign Exchange Risk Management


•Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities

•Forecasted purchases and sales in foreign currency

At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had outstanding forward exchange and purchased option contracts with gross notional values of $1,272 and $1,103 respectively, with terms of less than 12 months. Approximately 82% of the contracts at June 30, 2019 mature within three months, 9% mature in three to six months and 9% in six to twelve months. The associated currency exposures being hedged at June 30, 2019 were materially consistent with our year-end currency exposures. There has not been any material change in our hedging strategy.

Foreign Currency Cash Flow Hedges

We designate a portion of our foreign currency derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of our foreign currency-denominated inventory purchases, sales and expenses. The net asset fair value of these contracts were $5 and $8 as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

Summary of Derivative Instruments Fair Value



Summary of Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)

Derivative gains and (losses) affect the income statement based on whether such derivatives are designated as hedges of underlying exposures. The following is a summary of derivative gains (losses).

Designated Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)



During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, no amount of ineffectiveness was recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for these designated cash flow hedges and all components of each derivative’s gain or (loss) were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. In addition, no amount was recorded for an underlying exposure that did not occur or was not expected to occur.

As of June 30, 2019, a net after-tax gain of $6 was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with our cash flow hedging activity. The entire balance is expected to be reclassified into Net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions.

Non-Designated Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)

Non-designated derivative instruments are primarily instruments used to hedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. They are not designated as hedges since there is a natural offset for the remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency-denominated asset or liability.

Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 



For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 currency (losses) gains, net were $0 and $(2), respectively, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $(1) and $1, respectively. Net currency gains and losses include the mark-to-market adjustments of the derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and the related cost of those derivatives as well as the remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and are included in Other expenses, net.

Note 15 – Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

The following table represents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The basis for the measurement at fair value in all cases is Level 2 – Significant Other Observable Inputs. 


We utilize the income approach to measure the fair value for our derivative assets and liabilities. The income approach uses pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves, currency exchange rates and forward prices, and therefore are classified as Level 2.

Fair value for our deferred compensation plan investments in mutual funds is based on quoted market prices for those funds. Fair value for deferred compensation plan liabilities is based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment selections.

Summary of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities 



The fair value amounts for Cash and cash equivalents and Accounts receivable, net, approximate carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair value of Short-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, and Long-term debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to us for debt of similar maturities (Level 2). The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at such date.

Note 18 – Stock-Based Compensation


We have a long-term incentive plan whereby eligible employees may be granted restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares (PSs) and stock options (SOs). We grant stock-based compensation awards in order to continue to attract and retain qualified employees and to better align employees' interests with those of our shareholders. Each of these awards is subject to settlement with newly issued shares of our common stock. 



The board of directors (the "Board") recently approved a change in the timing of our annual grant of awards from April to January to fully align the grant date with the underlying performance period related to PSs. The following is a summary of the program design and performance metrics effective for our January 2019 grant and grants thereafter, as approved by the Board. Stock options were not awarded under the 2019 grant. 

Restricted Stock Units


Performance Shares


Performance-Based Component

PSs vest contingent upon meeting pre-determined cumulative performance metrics. The fair value of our PSs is based upon the grant-date market price. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on management's estimate of the number of shares expected to vest. If the cumulative three-year actual results exceed the stated targets, all plan participants have the potential to earn additional shares of common stock up to a maximum overachievement of 100% of the original grant. If the stated targets are not met, any recognized compensation cost would be reversed. Shares granted through June 30, 2019 under this program were 708, with a corresponding weighted average grant date fair value of $22.49 per share.

Market-Based Component

The Absolute Share Price metric is based on Xerox's average closing price for the last 20 trading days of the performance period, inclusive of dividends during the three-year performance period. Payout for this portion of the PS will be determined based on total return targets approved by the compensation committee of the Board. Since this portion of the PS award represents a market condition, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine the grant-date fair value.

The risk-free interest rate was based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yield curve on the valuation date, with a maturity matched to the performance period.




The weighted average of fair values used to record compensation expense as determined by the Monte Carlo simulation.





For performance between the levels described above, the degree of vesting is interpolated on a linear basis.

Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the fair value determined by the Monte Carlo simulation and, except in cases of employee forfeiture, cannot be reversed regardless of performance. Shares granted through June 30, 2019 under this program were 708.

Legal Matters


Brazil Contingencies



The decrease in the unreserved portion of the tax contingency, inclusive of any related interest, was primarily related to closed cases, partially offset by currency and interest. With respect to the unreserved tax contingency, the majority has been assessed by management as being remote as to the likelihood of ultimately resulting in a loss to the Company. In connection with the above proceedings, customary local regulations may require us to make escrow cash deposits or post other security of up to half of the total amount in dispute, as well as, additional surety bonds and letters of credit, which include associated indexation. Generally, any escrowed amounts would be refundable and any liens on assets would be removed to the extent the matters are resolved in our favor. We are also involved in certain disputes with contract and former employees. Exposures related to labor matters are not material to the financial statements as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. We routinely assess all these matters as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability against our Brazilian operations and record our best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where we assess the likelihood of an ultimate loss as probable.

Litigation Against the Company



In February 2018, five complaints (the "Fuji Transaction Shareholder Lawsuits"), including four putative class actions (which have been consolidated), were filed by Xerox shareholders in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the "Court") in connection with the proposed transaction to combine Xerox and Fuji Xerox (the “Fuji Transaction”). All of the complaints name as defendants Xerox, its directors, and FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation (“Fujifilm”). The complaint in one of the actions also names as a defendant Ursula M. Burns, the former Chief Executive Officer of Xerox. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that Xerox's directors breached their fiduciary duties in negotiating, approving, and purportedly making false and misleading disclosures about the Fuji Transaction, and that Fujifilm aided and abetted those breaches. The complaint in one of the actions further alleges that Xerox and the director defendants engaged in common law fraud by purportedly failing to disclose information about the joint venture agreements between Xerox and Fujifilm. The Fuji Transaction Shareholder Lawsuits seek injunctive relief preventing 

Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 


One of the Fuji Transaction Shareholder Lawsuits was brought by Darwin Deason, a Xerox shareholder ("Deason I"). Another complaint was filed by Mr. Deason against Xerox and its directors in the same Court on March 2, 2018 ("Deason II") alleging that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by refusing Mr. Deason’s request for a waiver of the deadline for nomination of a new slate of Xerox directors. In Deason II, Mr. Deason sought to enjoin Xerox and its directors from enforcing Xerox’s advance notice by-laws, thereby allowing Mr. Deason to proceed with the nominations, as well as costs, fees, and other relief.

On April 27, 2018, the Court issued decisions and orders granting plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions, which (i) enjoined Xerox from “taking any further action to consummate the change of control transaction between Xerox and Fuji that was announced on January 31, 2018 pending a final determination of the claims asserted in the underlying action;” (ii) enjoined Xerox from enforcing its advance notice bylaw provision requiring shareholders to nominate directors for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting by December 11, 2017; and (iii) required Xerox to waive such advance notice bylaw provision to permit the noticing of a slate of director nominees for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting, and denying defendants’ motions to dismiss.

On May 1, 2018, Xerox entered into a Director Appointment, Nomination and Settlement Agreement (the “Initial Settlement Agreement”) with Mr. Deason and Carl C. Icahn and certain of his affiliates who were also Xerox shareholders (the "Icahn Group"), among others, that would have resolved Deason I, Deason II and the pending proxy contest in connection with Xerox’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Initial Settlement Agreement expired by its terms on May 3, 2018 without becoming effective.

On May 7, 2018, defendants filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department, notices of appeal of, and motions to stay pending appeal, the lower Court’s decision and order. Defendants also moved the appellate court for interim relief ordering that the appeal be heard on an expedited basis. At a hearing before the appellate court on May 7, 2018, the appellate court ruled that the appeals would be heard on an expedited basis and granted a partial interim stay allowing Xerox and Fujifilm to take steps to seek regulatory approvals related to the Fuji Transaction pending a ruling from the appellate court on defendants’ motions to stay pending appeal.

On May 13, 2018, a second Director Appointment, Nomination and Settlement Agreement (the "Final Settlement Agreement") with respect to Deason I, Deason II and the pending proxy contest in connection with Xerox's 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders that was initiated by the Icahn Group was signed on behalf of Mr. Deason, the Icahn Group and all defendants except Fujifilm, and a memorandum of understanding regarding settlement of the putative class case was signed by all defendants except Fujifilm. Pursuant to the settlements, the settling defendants withdrew their appeal and motion to stay in Deason I and Deason II. The settling defendants also withdrew their motion to stay in the putative class case. The Court entered a stipulation of discontinuance as to the settling parties in Deason II on May 14, 2018, and agreed on June 22, 2018 to do the same in Deason I. 

On June 14, 2018, Fujifilm filed answers in Deason I and the putative class case, along with cross-claims against the members of the Xerox Board (as constituted before May 13, 2018) and a third-party complaint against Xerox director Jonathan Christodoro, seeking contribution for any potential award against Fujifilm for aiding and abetting purported breaches of fiduciary duties.

On June 19, 2018, the putative class plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of a stipulation of settlement that would resolve the claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the putative class case against all defendants, other than Fujifilm. Carmen Ribbe, the plaintiff in the below derivative action, and Fujifilm filed oppositions to the motion on July 10, 2018. 

On June 22, 2018, the Court entered an order denying a joint motion by the putative class plaintiffs and the settling defendants to dissolve the injunction in the putative class case as against the settling defendants, and entered an order denying Fujifilm’s motion to dissolve the injunctions in the putative class case and Deason I in their entirety.

On July 16, 2018, the Court held a hearing concerning the putative class plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval of the settlement in the putative class case. The Court indicated that it was not inclined to consider motions for approval of the settlement prior to considering whether the putative class should be certified.

On August 2, 2018, the Appellate Division entered orders recognizing the Xerox defendants’ withdrawal of their appeal in the Deason cases and denying all appellants’ motions to stay pending determination of appeals in the Deason and putative class cases.

On August 2, 2018, the Appellate Division entered orders (i) at their request, deeming withdrawn the Xerox defendants’ appeal and motion to stay in the Deason cases; (ii) upon their request, deeming withdrawn the Xerox defendants’ 

Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

motion to stay, pending determination of appeal, the putative class case; and (iii) denying Fujifilm’s motion to stay pending determination of its appeals in the Deason and putative case cases.

On September 21, 2018, putative class plaintiffs filed a motion for certification of a settlement class and a motion to transmit notice of the proposed settlement to the proposed class. On October 17, 2018, derivative plaintiff Carmen Ribbe and Fujifilm filed oppositions to the putative class plaintiffs’ motion to transmit notice to the proposed class. The class has not yet been certified, and preliminary approval has not been granted.

The Appellate Division heard oral argument on September 25, 2018 on Fujifilm’s appeal of the Court’s decision. On October 16, 2018, the Appellate Division entered a decision and order reversing the Court’s rulings, ordering that the claims brought against Fujifilm in the cases by Mr. Deason and the purported class be dismissed, and further ordering that the preliminary injunction of the proposed Fuji Transaction be dissolved (the “Appellate Decision and Order”).

On November 15, 2018, the putative class plaintiffs filed with the Appellate Division a motion seeking the opportunity to reargue Fujifilm’s appeal or, in the alternative, for leave to appeal the Appellate Decision and Order to the New York State Court of Appeals.

On December 6, 2018, pursuant to the Appellate Decision and Order, the Court entered a judgment dismissing the complaints against Fujifilm in Deason I and the putative class case. The Court further issued orders denying the putative class plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, without prejudice to renewing the motion after the outcome of any appeals of the Appellate Decision and Order. 

On January 8, 2019, the Court entered an order staying all further proceedings in Deason I and the putative class case until thirty days after exhaustion of appeals, including any appeals to the New York State Court of Appeals, of the Appellate Decision and Order. On January 9, 2019, the Court entered an order denying the putative class plaintiffs’ motion to transmit notice to the proposed class, without prejudice to renewal of their motion at a later time.

On October 31, 2018 and January 3, 2019, respectively, Xerox and the Xerox director defendants in the putative class case filed with the Appellate Division a request and motion seeking an extension, until after any decision regarding approval of settlement of the putative class action, of the deadline by which to perfect their appeal of the Court’s April 27, 2018 decision and order. On May 16, 2019, the Appellate Division entered an order granting the motion and extended the deadline until the October 2019 Term.

On February 21, 2019, the Appellate Division issued an order denying the putative class plaintiffs’ motion seeking to reargue Fujifilm’s appeal or, in the alternative, for leave to appeal the Appellate Decision and Order to the New York State Court of Appeals. No further notice of appeal was filed, and the Appellate Decision and Order became final and unappealable on March 26, 2019.

On May 3, 2019, putative class plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for approval of the form of a notice to putative class members. On May 6, 2019, putative class plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification and notice of motion to approve class settlement and proposed final approval order. On May 24, 2019, the Court entered an order approving the form notice and proposed manner of its dissemination.

On June 6, 2019, the Court entered an order pursuant to which plaintiffs submitted their motion to approve attorneys’ fees and expenses on July 19, 2019; requiring filing of any objections to or opt-outs from the proposed putative class settlement by August 9, 2019; and setting September 6, 2019 for its hearing on putative class plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and settlement approval.

Xerox will vigorously defend these lawsuits to the extent that the proceedings continue as to Xerox. At this time, however, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in these lawsuits. Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs.


On April 11, 2019, Carmen Ribbe filed a putative derivative and class action stockholder complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for New York County, naming as defendants Xerox, current Board members Gregory Q. Brown, Joseph J. Echevarria, Cheryl Gordon Krongard, Sara Martinez Tucker, Keith Cozza, Giovanni G. Visentin, Jonathan Christodoro, Nicholas Graziano, and A. Scott Letier, and former Board members Jeffrey Jacobson, William Curt Hunter, Robert J. Keegan, Charles Prince, Ann N. Reese, and Stephen H. Rusckowski. Plaintiff previously filed a putative shareholder derivative lawsuit on May 24, 2018 against certain of these defendants, as well as others, in the same court; that lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice on December 6, 2018. The new complaint includes putative derivative claims on behalf of Xerox for breach of fiduciary duty against the members of the Xerox Board who 

Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

approved Xerox’s entry into agreements to settle the Deason and In re Xerox Corporation Consolidated Shareholder Litigation (“XCCSL”) actions (described above). Plaintiff alleges that the settlements ceded control of the Board and the Company to Darwin Deason and Carl C. Icahn without a vote by, or compensation to, other Xerox stockholders; improperly provided certain benefits and releases to the resigning and continuing directors; and subjected Xerox to potential breach of contract damages in an action by Fuji relating to Xerox’s termination of the proposed Fuji Transaction. Plaintiff also alleges that the current Board members breached their fiduciary duties by allegedly rejecting plaintiff’s January 14, 2019 shareholder demand on the Board to remedy harms arising from entry into the Deason and XCCSL settlements. The new complaint further includes direct claims for breach of fiduciary duty on behalf of a putative class of current Xerox stockholders other than Mr. Deason, Mr. Icahn, and their affiliated entities (the “Ribbe Class”) against the defendants for causing Xerox to enter into the Deason and XCCSL settlements, which plaintiff alleges perpetuated control of Xerox by Mr. Icahn and Mr. Deason and denied the voting franchise of Xerox shareholders. Among other things, plaintiff seeks damages in an unspecified amount for the alleged fiduciary breaches in favor of Xerox against defendants jointly and severally; rescission or reformation of the Deason and XCCSL settlements; restitution of funds paid to the resigning directors under the Deason settlement; an injunction against defendants’ engaging in the alleged wrongful practices and equitable relief affording the putative Ribbe Class the ability to determine the composition of the Board; costs and attorneys’ fees; and other further relief as the Court may deem proper. 

Defendants accepted service of the complaint as of May 16, 2019. On June 4, 2019, the Court entered an order setting a briefing schedule for defendants’ motions to dismiss the complaint. On July 12, 2019, plaintiff filed a motion to preclude defendants from referencing in their motions to dismiss the formation of, or work by, the committee of the Board established to investigate plaintiff’s shareholder demand. On July 18, 2019, the Court denied plaintiff’s motion and adjourned sine die the deadline by which defendants must file any motions to dismiss the complaint. Xerox will vigorously defend against this matter. At this time, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in this litigation. Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs.



At a conference on September 24, 2018, the Court stayed all discovery pending resolution of Xerox’s motion to dismiss. Xerox filed its motion to dismiss on October 1, 2018. On February 22, 2019, following oral argument, the Court denied the motion to dismiss.

On March 12, 2019, the Court entered a scheduling order setting various case deadlines. Xerox filed its answer denying the claims on March 15, 2019. Discovery has commenced and is ongoing. On June 24, 2019, the Court entered a stipulated revised scheduling order extending certain case deadlines.

Xerox believes the lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend it. At this time, however, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in this litigation. Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs.



On May 9, 2014, the State of Texas, via the Texas Office of Attorney General (the “State”), filed a lawsuit in the 53rd Judicial District Court of Travis County, Texas. The lawsuit alleged that Xerox Corporation, Xerox State Healthcare, LLC and ACS State Healthcare (collectively “the Defendants”) violated the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act in 

Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

the administration of ACS State Healthcare’s contract with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services (“HHSC”). Xerox Corporation provided a guaranty of contractual performance with respect to the ACS State Healthcare contract. The State alleged that the Defendants made false representations of material facts regarding the processes, procedures, implementation and results regarding the prior authorization of orthodontic claims. The State sought recovery of actual damages, two times the amount of any overpayments made as a result of alleged unlawful acts, civil penalties, pre- and post-judgment interest and all costs and attorneys’ fees. The State referenced the amount in controversy as exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars. The Defendants filed their Answer in June 2014 denying all allegations. In August 2017, the State of Texas filed a Second Amended Petition, which made substantially similar allegations and sought similar remedies as the original lawsuit. On October 23, 2017, Xerox Corporation filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking judgment in Xerox's favor on all claims against it. On July 2, 2018, the Court denied the State of Texas’ motion for a determination of the adequacy of its pleadings as to Xerox or in the alternative, seeking leave to amend its petition to bring additional claims against Xerox.


At Conduent’s request, the parties executed an amendment to the Agreement providing for accelerated payment terms and for one or more Conduent letters of credit to facilitate earlier dismissal of the case.

This matter is a “Conduent Liability”, as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement dated as of December 31, 2016 between Xerox Corporation and Conduent Incorporated, for which Conduent is required to indemnify Xerox. Conduent is entitled to direct the defense of this matter.


On October 21, 2016, the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System (“plaintiff”) filed a purported securities class action complaint against Xerox Corporation, Ursula Burns, Luca Maestri, Kathryn Mikells, Lynn Blodgett and Robert Zapfel (collectively, “defendants”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of the plaintiff and certain purchasers or acquirers of Xerox common stock. The complaint alleged that defendants made false and misleading statements, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5, relating to the operations and prospects of Xerox’s Health Enterprise business. Plaintiff sought, among other things, unspecified monetary damages and attorneys’ fees. Other, similar lawsuits may follow. On December 28, 2016, the Court entered a stipulated order setting out a schedule for amendment of the complaint and for defendants’ response to that complaint following the Court’s appointment of lead plaintiff under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. On February 28, 2017, the Court issued an opinion and order appointing the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System ("APERS") as lead plaintiff. On May 1, 2017, APERS filed an amended complaint, alleging substantially similar claims and seeking substantially similar relief, but adding David Bywater and Mary Scanlon as defendants. On June 30, 2017, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint, and the motions were fully briefed on October 13, 2017. On March 20, 2018, the Court entered an opinion and order granting the motions, and on March 23, 2018, the Court entered a judgment of dismissal and closed the case. On April 20, 2018, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the appeal was fully briefed as of November 28, 2018. The Second Circuit heard oral argument on May 31, 2019. On June 6, 2019, the Second Circuit entered a summary order affirming the district court’s judgment dismissing the complaint.

Guarantees

We have issued or provided approximately $314 of guarantees as of June 30, 2019 in the form of letters of credit or surety bonds issued to i) support certain insurance programs; ii) support our obligations related to the Brazil contingencies; and iii) support certain contracts, primarily with public sector customers, which require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of our performance of contractual obligations.

In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract; the probability of which we believe is remote. We believe that our capacity in the surety markets as well as under various credit arrangements (including our Credit Facility) is sufficient to allow us to respond to future requests for proposals that require such credit support.

ITEM 2 — MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 


Throughout this document, references to “we,” “our,” the “Company,” and “Xerox” refer to Xerox Corporation and its subsidiaries. References to “Xerox Corporation” refer to the stand-alone parent company and do not include its subsidiaries.

Currency Impact

To understand the trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars on revenue and expenses. We refer to this analysis as "constant currency", “currency impact” or “the impact from currency.” This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate. This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.

Overview

Second Quarter 2019 Review 

Total revenue of $2.29 billion for second quarter 2019 declined 8.8% from second quarter 2018, including a 1.6-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. The decrease in revenue reflected a decrease of 8.4% in Post sale revenue, including a 1.8-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency, and a decrease of 10.2% in Equipment sales revenue, including a 1.2-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. The decline in Post sale revenue reflected the continuing trends of lower page volumes, an ongoing competitive price environment and a lower population of devices, as well as lower transactional Post sale revenue from unbundled supplies from our developing market regions and our indirect channels in the U.S., as well as from paper in our developing market sales units. The decline in Equipment sales primarily reflected continued price declines and lower sales of our office-centric devices (entry and mid-range products) partially affected by a challenging comparison against the period of highest equipment revenue growth in the prior year. Lower revenues from our mid-range ConnectKey devices also reflected the continued impact of organizational changes within our XBS sales organization as part of Project Own It. 

Total revenue of $4.50 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2019 declined 9.1% as compared to the prior year period, including a 2.0-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. The decrease in revenue reflected a decrease of 8.8% in Post sale revenue, including a 2.1-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency, and a decrease of 10.2% in Equipment sales revenue, including a 1.8-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. The decline in Post sale revenue reflected the continuing trends of lower page volumes, an ongoing competitive price environment and a lower population of devices, as well as lower transactional Post sale revenue from unbundled supplies and paper in our developing market sales units. The decline in Equipment sales primarily reflected lower revenues from our mid-range products, which were impacted by organizational changes within XBS sales organization, as we transitioned a significant number of accounts from U.S. Enterprise in the first half of 2019. 



Second quarter 2019 Net income attributable to Xerox increased $69 million as compared to second quarter 2018 primarily due to lower Transaction and related costs, net and higher Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates. In addition, lower revenues were offset by the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements from our Project Own It transformation actions. Second quarter 2019 Adjusted1 net income attributable to Xerox increased

$20 million as compared to second quarter 2018. The increase was primarily related to increased operating profits reflecting the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements from Project Own It, which offset the pace of revenue decline, as well as higher Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates.

Net income attributable to Xerox for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased $179 million as compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates as well as lower Transaction and related costs, net and Income tax expense. The increase also reflected the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements from our Project Own It transformation actions, which offset the impact of lower revenues. These benefits were partially offset by higher Restructuring and related costs. Adjusted1 net income attributable to Xerox for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased $61 million as compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily related to higher Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates as well as increased operating profits reflecting the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements from Project Own It, which more than offset the decline in revenues.

Cash flows provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were $539 million, as compared to $451 million in the prior year period primarily reflecting increased dividends from equity investments and lower cash payments for Transaction and related costs. These benefits were partially offset by higher payments for restructuring related costs and a use of cash for working capital2. Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $72 million including capital expenditures of $31 million and acquisitions of $42 million. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $846 million reflecting payments of $406 million on Senior Notes, $300 million for share repurchases and dividend payments of $122 million.


Our rate of revenue decline in the second quarter 2019 was impacted by organizational changes, primarily in North America. While this impact gradually mitigated during the quarter, it still remains and we recognize that the implementation of our strategic initiatives to transform the company for long-term sustainability (including offering, go-to-market, sales coverage and cost structure changes) will continue to impact our revenues in the near term. As a result, we now expect our revenues to decline approximately 6% for the year, excluding an approximate 1.0-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency, compared to our previous guidance of an approximate 5% decline, excluding an approximate 1.0-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency.

Total Installs

Installs reflect new placement of devices only. Revenue associated with equipment installations may be reflected up-front in Equipment sales or over time either through rental income or as part of our Xerox Services revenues (which are both reported within our post sale revenues), depending on the terms and conditions of our agreements with customers. Installs include activity from Xerox Services and Xerox-branded products shipped to our XBS sales unit. Detail by product group (see Geographic Sales Channels and Product and Offerings Definitions) is shown below.



•12% decrease in color multifunction devices reflecting lower installs of ConnectKey devices from our indirect channels in the U.S. and low-end devices from EMEA.

•1% increase in black-and-white multifunction devices driven by higher activity from our EMEA organization, including low-end devices in developing market regions.


•12% decrease in mid-range color installs reflecting lower installs of ConnectKey devices. The decrease was significantly impacted by lower activity as a result of the transitional impact associated with recently implemented organizational changes in our XBS sales organization (as part of our Project Own It transformation actions), which included the transitioning of accounts to implement coverage changes, consolidation of real estate locations and the reduction of management layers. The decrease also reflected lower activity and a lack of large deals in EMEA, as well as a challenging comparison against the period with the highest activity growth in the prior year, partially due to the timing of our ConnectKey product launch.

•9% decrease in mid-range black-and-white reflecting lower installs of ConnectKey devices primarily from EMEA. The decline also reflected market trends


•1% increase in high-end color installs reflecting continued demand for our Iridesse production press in EMEA and higher installs of our inkjet cut-sheet systems. Lower activity from iGen and Versant production systems provided a partial headwind.

•33% decrease in high-end black-and-white systems reflecting market trends. 



•3% decrease in color multifunction devices reflecting lower installs of ConnectKey devices and low-end devices from EMEA, partially offset by higher activity in our indirect channels in the U.S.

•Installs of black-and-white multifunction devices were flat reflecting higher installs of ConnectKey devices, as well as higher activity in our indirect channels in the U.S, offset by lower activity from our EMEA organization, including low-end devices in developing market regions.

Gross Margin

Second quarter 2019 gross margin of 39.2% decreased 0.7-percentage points as compared to second quarter 2018, due to lower equipment margin, which reflected the unfavorable volume and mix impacts of lower sales, primarily from mid-range equipment in our XBS organization, as well as targeted price actions partially offset by cost productivity. The decrease also included the unfavorable impact of transaction currency.

Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

Gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2019 of 39.7% decreased 0.2-percentage points as compared to the prior year period, due to lower equipment margin, which reflected the unfavorable volume and mix impacts of lower sales, primarily from mid-range equipment in our XBS organization, as well as targeted price actions partially offset by cost productivity. The decrease also included the unfavorable impact of transaction currency.

Second quarter 2019 equipment gross margin of 28.8% decreased 3.2-percentage points as compared to second quarter 2018, including an approximate 0.8-percentage point unfavorable impact from transaction currency and also reflecting the unfavorable volume and mix impacts of lower sales, primarily from mid-range equipment in our XBS organization, as well as targeted price actions partially offset by cost productivity.

Post sale gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2019 of 41.8% decreased 0.1-percentage points as compared to the prior year period, driven by the impact of lower revenues, almost entirely offset by productivity and restructuring savings associated with our Project Own It transformation actions. 







Selling, Administrative and General Expenses (SAG)

SAG as a percentage of revenue of 22.7% decreased by 2.2-percentage points as compared to second quarter 2018, primarily reflecting the benefit from productivity and restructuring associated with our Project Own It transformation actions. 

SAG of $519 million decreased $105 million as compared to second quarter 2018, reflecting productivity and restructuring savings associated with our Project Own It transformation actions as well as favorable impacts of approximately $9 million from translation currency and $20 million from higher costs in the prior year related to the termination of an IT project and the accelerated depreciation associated with the exit of a surplus real estate facility. Bad debt expense of $12 million was flat as compared to second quarter 2018 and on a trailing twelve month basis (TTM) remained at less than one percent of total receivables.

SAG as a percentage of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 of 23.7% decreased by 1.6-percentage points as compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting the benefit from productivity and restructuring associated with our Project Own It transformation actions. 

Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

SAG for the six months ended June 30, 2019 of $1,067 million decreased $185 million as compared to the prior year period, reflecting productivity and restructuring savings associated with our Project Own It transformation actions as well as favorable impacts of approximately $22 million from translation currency and $29 million from higher costs in the prior year related to the termination of an IT project and the accelerated depreciation associated with the exit of a surplus real estate facility. Bad debt expense of $25 million was flat as compared to the prior year period and on a trailing twelve month basis (TTM) remained at less than one percent of total receivables.

Restructuring and Related Costs











Restructuring and related costs were $72 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and included $25 million of severance costs related to headcount reductions of approximately 300 employees worldwide, $17 million of other contractual termination costs and $46 million of asset impairment charges. These costs were partially offset by $16 million of net reversals, primarily resulting from changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives as well as $2 million in favorable adjustments from the early termination of prior period impaired leases. 

The implementation of our Project Own It initiatives as well as other strategic initiatives is expected to result in significant cost savings in 2019 and future years. However, as noted in the discussion on Revenues, the implementation of these initiatives negatively impacted our revenues in the first half of 2019. The impact on our revenues from these initiatives began to moderate late in the second quarter, and we expect to make further progress reducing the impact from these initiatives on our revenues in the second half of 2019. Nevertheless, any expected savings associated with these initiatives may continue to be offset to some extent until initiatives are fully implemented and stabilized.


Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

Restructuring and related costs were $62 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and included $64 million of severance costs related to headcount reductions of approximately 950 employees worldwide and $12 million of lease cancellation costs partially offset by $14 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives.

The restructuring reserve balance as of June 30, 2019 for all programs was $69 million, of which $67 million is expected to be spent over the next twelve months.

Refer to Note 12 - Restructuring Programs in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring programs.

Transaction and Related Costs, Net

Transaction and related costs, net are expenses incurred in connection with Xerox's planned transaction with Fuji, which was terminated in May 2018, as well as costs and expenses related to the previously disclosed settlement agreement reached with certain shareholders and litigation related to the terminated transaction and other shareholder actions. Transaction and related costs, net for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were $4 million as compared to $96 million in the prior year period. We continue to pursue additional recoveries from insurance carriers and other parties for costs and expenses related to the terminated Fuji transaction and related shareholder litigation and therefore additional recoveries and adjustments may be recorded in future periods, when finalized. 

Amortization of Intangible Assets

Amortization of intangible assets for the six months ended June 30, 2019 of $26 million increased by $2 million as compared to the prior year period. The increase primarily reflected the accelerated write-off of trade names associated with our realignment and consolidation of certain XBS sales units as part of our Project Own It transformation actions.

Worldwide Employment

Worldwide employment was approximately 27,900 as of June 30, 2019 and decreased by approximately 4,500 from December 31, 2018. The reduction resulted from net attrition (attrition net of gross hires), of which a large portion is not expected to be backfilled, as well as the impact of organizational changes including employees transferred as part of the shared services arrangement recently entered into with HCL Technologies.

Other Expenses, Net


Non-Financing Interest Expense

Second quarter non-financing interest expense of $26 million was $1 million lower than second quarter 2018. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $1 million from second quarter 2018 primarily due to a lower debt balance.

Non-financing interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 of $53 million was $3 million lower than the prior year period. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $5 million from the prior year period primarily due to a lower debt balance.

Refer to Note 13 - Debt in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the interest expense.

Non-Service Retirement-Related Costs

Non-service retirement-related costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased $15 million and $27 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, primarily driven by the favorable impact of a 2018 amendment to our U.S. Retiree Health Plan partially offset by higher losses from pension settlements in the U.S.

Income Taxes





Our effective tax rate is based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors, including the taxation of foreign income. In addition, our effective tax rate will change based on discrete or other nonrecurring events that may not be predictable.



Equity in Net Income (Loss) of Unconsolidated Affiliates


Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates primarily reflects our 25% share of Fuji Xerox Net income (loss). For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, equity income increased $15 million and $128 million as compared to the prior year periods, primarily reflecting savings from restructuring. The increase in Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates for the six months ended June 30, 2019 also reflects $64 million of lower year-over-year charges of related to our share of Fuji Xerox after-tax restructuring and other charges, as well as an approximate $28 million charge related to an out-of-period charge at Fuji Xerox in the prior year.

Financial Risk Management


We are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet. As permitted, certain of these derivative contracts have been designated for hedge accounting treatment. Certain of our derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are effective as economic hedges. These derivative contracts are likewise required to be recognized each period at fair value and therefore do result in some level of volatility. The level of volatility will vary with the type and amount of derivative hedges outstanding, as well as fluctuations in the currency and interest rate markets during the period. The related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.

By their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange and interest rate movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. We do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a diversified group of major financial institutions. Further, our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating. Credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties.

The current market events have not required us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risk. Refer to Note 14 – Financial Instruments in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and information on our financial risk management strategies.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We have reported our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, we have discussed our financial results using the non-GAAP measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related income tax effects.


These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted Earnings Measures

•Net income and Earnings per share (EPS)

•Effective tax rate








Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

We believe the exclusion of these items allows investors to better understand and analyze the results for the period as compared to prior periods and expected future trends in our business.

Adjusted Operating Income and Margin

We calculate and utilize adjusted operating income and margin measures by adjusting our reported pre-tax income and margin amounts. In addition to the costs and expenses noted as adjustments for our Adjusted Earnings measures, adjusted operating income and margin also exclude the remaining amounts included in Other expenses, net, which are primarily non-financing interest expense and certain other non-operating costs and expenses. We exclude these amounts in order to evaluate our current and past operating performance and to better understand the expected future trends in our business.

Constant Currency (CC)

Refer to "Currency Impact" for a discussion of this measure and its use in our analysis of revenue growth. 

Summary

Management believes that all of these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current period’s results against the corresponding prior period’s results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures.

In March 2019, the Company entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we are outsourcing certain global administrative and support functions, including, among others, selected information technology, order to collection and finance functions (excluding accounting). The transition of these functions to HCL is expected to take up to 18 months. HCL is expected to make certain up-front and ongoing investments in software, tools and other technology to consolidate, optimize and automate the transferred functions. This arrangement is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this arrangement, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment. Refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
