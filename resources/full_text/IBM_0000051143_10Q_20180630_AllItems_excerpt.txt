Noncontrolling interest amounts of $3.8 million and $3.5 million, net of tax, for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $11.7 million and $7.1 million, net of tax, for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, are included as a reduction within other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 

Interim results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the companys 2017 Annual Report. 

Within the financial statements and tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This is annotated where applicable. 


New Standards to be Implemented 

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance for credit impairment based on an expected loss model rather than an incurred loss model. The guidance requires the consideration of all available relevant information when estimating expected credit losses, including past events, current conditions and forecasts and their implications for expected credit losses. The guidance is effective January 1, 2020 with a one year early adoption permitted. The company has established an implementation team and is evaluating the impact of the new guidance. 

The FASB issued guidance in February 2016, with amendments in 2018, which changes the accounting for leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The guidance makes some changes to lessor accounting, including the elimination of the use of third-party residual value guarantee insurance in the capital lease test, and overall aligns with the new revenue recognition guidance. The guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. There are certain practical expedients that can be elected which the company is currently evaluating for application. The guidance is effective January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The company will adopt the guidance as of the effective date. 

A cross-functional implementation team has been established which is evaluating the lease portfolio, system, process and policy change requirements. The company has made progress in gathering the necessary data elements for the lease population and a system provider has been selected, with system configuration and implementation underway. The company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial results and expects it will have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The company is currently planning on electing the package of practical expedients not to reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs and is evaluating the other practical expedients available under the guidance. 

The companys operating lease commitments, as a lessee, were $6.6 billion at December 31, 2017. From a lessor perspective, in 2017, the use of third-party residual value guarantee insurance resulted in the company recognizing $452 million of sales-type lease revenue that would otherwise have been recognized over the lease period as operating lease revenue. Further, due to changes in lease termination guidance, when equipment is returned to the company prior to the end of the lease term, the carrying amounts of lease receivables, which remain outstanding relating to that equipment and still

expected to be collected, will be reclassified to loan receivables. The amount that would have been reclassified from lease receivables to loan receivables in 2017, under the application of this new guidance, would have been approximately $450 million. 

The company continues to assess the potential impacts of the guidance, including changes resulting from the pending accounting standard updates to be issued by the FASB, normal and ongoing business dynamics or potential changes in contracting terms, and as a result, preliminary conclusions are subject to change. 

Standards Implemented 


In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain areas, better portray the economic results of an entitys risk management activities in its financial statements and make targeted improvements to presentation and disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. The company adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2018, and it did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. 


In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance which addresses aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018 and early adoption was not permitted except for limited provisions. The company adopted the guidance on the effective date. Certain equity investments are now measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. The amendment also simplified the impairment test of equity investments that lack readily determinable fair value. The guidance did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. 

The FASB issued guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers in May 2014 with amendments in 2015 and 2016. Revenue recognition depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance also requires specific disclosures relating to revenue recognition. The company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. At adoption, $557 million was reclassified from notes and accounts receivable-trade and deferred income-current to prepaid expenses and other current assets to establish the opening balance for net contract assets. In-scope sales commission costs previously recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings were capitalized in deferred costs in accordance with the transition guidance, in the amount of $737 million. Deferred income of $29 million was recorded for certain software licenses that will be recognized over time versus at a point in time under previous guidance. Additionally, net deferred taxes were reduced by $184 million in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, resulting in a cumulative-effect net increase to retained earnings of $524 million. The guidance did not have a 


Table of Contents 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 

material impact in the companys consolidated financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. The company expects revenue recognition for its broad portfolio of hardware, software, and services offerings to remain largely unchanged. Refer to note 3, Revenue Recognition, for additional information, including further discussion on the impact of adoption and changes in accounting policies relating to revenue recognition. 

In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies the definition of a business. The guidance provides a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities acquired or sold is a business. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018 and early adoption was permitted. The company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2017, and it did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. 

In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets, other than inventory, at the time of transfer. Assets within the scope of the guidance include intellectual property and property, plant and equipment. The guidance was effective January 1, 2018 and early adoption was permitted. The company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2017 using the required modified retrospective method. At adoption, $95 million and $47 million were reclassified from investments and sundry assets and prepaid expenses and other current assets, respectively into retained earnings. Additionally, net deferred taxes of $244 million were established in deferred taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, resulting in a cumulative-effect net increase to retained earnings of $102 million. In January 2017, the company had one transaction that generated a $582 million benefit to income tax expense, income from continuing operations and net income and a benefit to both basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.62 per share for the six months ended June 30, 2017. No transactions impacted the consolidated financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The ongoing impact of this guidance will be dependent on any transaction that is within its scope. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which changes the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The guidance was effective and adopted by the company on January 1, 2017, and it did not have a material impact in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The ongoing impact of the guidance could result in increased volatility in the provision for income taxes and earnings per share in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, depending on the companys share price at exercise or vesting of share-based awards compared to grant date, however these impacts are not expected to be material. These impacts are recorded on a prospective basis. The company continues to estimate forfeitures in conjunction with measuring stock-based compensation cost. The guidance also requires cash payments on behalf of employees for shares directly withheld for taxes to be presented as financing outflows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The FASB also issued guidance in May 2017 and June 2018, which relates to the accounting for modifications of share-based payment awards and accounting for share-based payments issued to non-employees, respectively. The company adopted the guidance for modifications in the second quarter of 2017, and guidance for non-employees payments in the second quarter of 2018. The guidance had no impact in the consolidated financial results. 


Revenue 

The company accounts for a contract with a client when it has written approval, the contract is committed, the rights of the parties, including payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection. 

Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of a promised product or service transfers to a client, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, the company estimates the amount to which it expects to be entitled using either the expected value or most likely amount method. The companys contracts may include terms that could cause variability in the transaction price, including, for example, rebates, volume discounts, service-level penalties, and performance bonuses or other forms of contingent revenue. 


Table of Contents 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 

The company only includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The company may not be able to reliably estimate contingent revenue in certain long-term arrangements due to uncertainties that are not expected to be resolved for a long period of time or when the companys experience with similar types of contracts is limited. The companys arrangements infrequently include contingent revenue. Estimates of variable consideration and the determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the company, taking into consideration the type of client, the type of transaction and the specific facts and circumstances of each arrangement. Changes in estimates of variable consideration are included in the disclosure on pages 19 and 20. 


The company may include subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the company is acting as an agent between the client and the vendor, and gross when the company is the principal for the transaction. To determine whether the company is an agent or principal, the company considers whether it obtains control of the products or services before they are transferred to the customer. In making this evaluation, several factors are considered, most notably whether the company has primary responsibility for fulfillment to the client, as well as inventory risk and pricing discretion. 

The company recognizes revenue on sales to solution providers, resellers and distributors (herein referred to as resellers) when the reseller has economic substance apart from the company and the reseller is considered the principal for the transaction with the end-user client. 

The company reports revenue net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions. 

In addition to the aforementioned general policies, the following are the specific revenue recognition policies for arrangements with multiple performance obligations and for each major category of revenue. 

Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations 




Table of Contents 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 


· The client can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the client (that is, the product or service is capable of being distinct); and 

· The companys promise to transfer the product or service to the client is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the product or service is distinct within the context of the contract). 


To the extent the company grants the customer the option to acquire additional products or services in one of these arrangements, the company accounts for the option as a distinct performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to the customer that it would not receive without entering into the contract (e.g., a discount incremental to the range of discounts typically given for the product or service), in which case the client in effect pays in advance for the option to purchase future products or services. The company recognizes revenue when those future products or services are transferred or when the option expires. 

Services 

The companys primary services offerings include infrastructure services, including outsourcing, and other managed services; application management services; global process services (GPS); maintenance and support; and consulting, including the design and development of complex IT systems to a clients specifications (e.g., design and build). Many of these services can be delivered entirely or partially through cloud or as-a-Service delivery models. The companys services are provided on a time-and-material basis, as a fixed-price contract or as a fixed-price per measure of output contract and the contract terms range from less than one year to over 10 years. 

In services arrangements, the company typically satisfies the performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time. In design and build arrangements, the performance obligation is satisfied over time either because the client controls the asset as it is created (e.g., when the asset is built at the customer site) or because the companys performance does not create an asset with an alternative use and the company has an enforceable right to payment plus a reasonable profit for performance completed to date. In most other services arrangements, the performance obligation is satisfied over time because the client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided as the company performs the services. 

In outsourcing, other managed services, application management, GPS and other cloud-based services arrangements, the company determines whether the services performed during the initial phases of the arrangement, such as setup activities, are distinct. In most cases, the arrangement is a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer (i.e., distinct days of service). The company applies a measure of progress (typically time-based) to any fixed consideration and allocates variable consideration to the distinct periods of service based on usage. As a result, revenue is generally recognized over the period the services are provided on a usage basis. This results in revenue recognition that corresponds with the value to the client of the services transferred to date relative to the remaining services promised. 



Table of Contents 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 

Revenue related to maintenance and support services and extended warranty is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of performance because the company is standing ready to provide services. 

In fixed-price design and build contracts, revenue is recognized based on progress towards completion of the performance obligation using a cost-to-cost measure of progress (i.e., percentage-of-completion (POC) method of accounting). Revenue is recognized based on the labor costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated labor costs to fulfill the contract. Due to the nature of the work performed in these arrangements, the estimation of cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Key factors reviewed by the company to estimate costs to complete each contract are future labor and product costs and expected productivity efficiencies. If circumstances arise that change the original estimates of revenues, costs, or extent of progress toward completion, revisions to the estimates are made. These revisions may result in increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs, and such revisions are reflected in revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the circumstances that gave rise to the revision become known by the company. Refer to page 20 for the amount of revenue recognized in the reporting period on a cumulative catch-up basis (i.e., from performance obligations satisfied, or partially satisfied, in previous periods). 

The company performs ongoing profitability analyses of its design and build services contracts accounted for using a cost-to-cost measure of progress in order to determine whether the latest estimates of revenues, costs and profits require updating. If at any time these estimates indicate that the contract will be unprofitable, the entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately. For other types of services contracts, any losses are recorded as incurred. 

In some services contracts, the company bills the client prior to recognizing revenue from performing the services. In other services contracts, the company performs the services prior to billing the client. When the company performs services prior to billing the client in design and build contracts, the right to consideration is typically subject to milestone completion or client acceptance and the unbilled accounts receivable is classified as a contract asset. Refer to page 85 of the companys 2017 Annual Report for the amount of deferred income and unbilled accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 and 2016. 

Billings usually occur in the month after the company performs the services or in accordance with specific contractual provisions. 

Hardware 

The companys hardware offerings include the sale or lease of system servers and storage solutions. These products can also be delivered through as-a-Service or cloud delivery models, such as Storage-as-a-Service. The company also offers installation services for its more complex hardware products. Hardware offerings are often sold with distinct maintenance services, described under the Services section above. 

Revenue from hardware sales is recognized when control has transferred to the customer which typically occurs when the hardware has been shipped to the client, risk of loss has transferred to the client and the company has a present right to payment for the hardware. In limited circumstances when a hardware sale includes client acceptance provisions, revenue is recognized either when client acceptance has been obtained, client acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the company has objective evidence that the criteria specified in the client acceptance provisions have been satisfied. Revenue from hardware sales-type leases is recognized at the beginning of the lease term. Revenue from rentals and operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the rental or lease. 

Revenue from as-a-Service arrangements is recognized either on a straight-line basis or on a usage basis as described in the Services section above. Installation services are accounted for as distinct performance obligations with revenue recognized as the services are performed. Any cost of standard warranties is accrued when the corresponding revenue is recognized. Shipping and handling activities that occur after the client has obtained control of a product are accounted for as an activity to fulfill the promise to transfer the product rather than as an additional promised service and, therefore, no revenue is deferred and recognized over the shipping period. 

Software 

The companys software offerings include solutions software, which contains many of the companys strategic areas including analytics, data and security; transaction processing software, which primarily runs mission-critical systems for clients; integration software, which helps clients to create, connect and optimize their applications data and infrastructure; and, operating systems software, which provides operating systems for IBM Z and Power Systems hardware. Many of these offerings can be delivered entirely or partially through as-a-Service or cloud delivery models, while others are delivered as on-premise software licenses. 


Table of Contents 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 

Revenue from perpetual (one-time charge) license software is recognized at a point in time at the inception of the arrangement when control transfers to the client, if the software license is distinct from the post-contract support offered by the company. In limited circumstances, when the software requires continuous updates to provide the intended functionality, the software license and post-contract support are not distinct and revenue for the single performance obligation is recognized over time as the post-contract support is provided. This is only applicable to certain security software perpetual licenses offered by the company. Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, the company recognized revenue for these software licenses at a point in time at the inception of the arrangement. This change did not have a material impact on the companys financial statements. 

Revenue from post-contract support is recognized over the contract term on a straight-line basis because the company is providing a service of standing ready to provide support, when-and-if needed, and is providing unspecified software upgrades on a when-and-if available basis over the contract term. 

Revenue from software hosting or Software-as-a-Service arrangements is recognized either on a straight-line basis or on a usage basis as described in the Services section above. In software hosting arrangements, the rights provided to the client (e.g., ownership of a license, contract termination provisions and the feasibility of the client to operate the software) are considered in determining whether the arrangement includes a license. In arrangements that include a software license, the associated revenue is recognized in accordance with the software license recognition policy above rather than over time as a service. 

Revenue from term license software is recognized at a point in time for the committed term of the contract (which is typically one month due to client termination rights). However, if the amount of consideration to be paid in exchange for the license depends on client usage, revenue is recognized when the usage occurs. 

Financing 

Financing income attributable to sales-type leases, direct financing leases and loans is recognized on the accrual basis using the effective interest method. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 

Standalone Selling Price 

The company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price (SSP) is the price at which the company would sell a promised product or service separately to a client. In most cases, the company is able to establish SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar clients. The company typically establishes a standalone selling price range for its products and services which are reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. 

In certain instances, the company may not be able to establish a standalone selling price range based on observable prices and the company estimates the standalone selling price. The company estimates SSP by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, overall market conditions, including geographic or regional specific factors, competitive positioning, competitor actions, internal costs, profit objectives and pricing practices. Additionally, in certain circumstances, the company may estimate SSP for a product or service by applying the residual approach. This approach has been most commonly used when certain perpetual software licenses are only sold bundled with one year of post-contract support and a price has not been established for the software. Estimating SSP is a formal process that includes review and approval by the companys management. 

Services Costs 

Recurring operating costs for services contracts are recognized as incurred. For fixed-price design and build contracts, the costs of external hardware and software accounted for under the cost-to-cost measure of progress are deferred and recognized based on the labor costs incurred to date (i.e., the measure of progress), as a percentage of the total estimated labor costs to fulfill the contract as control transfers over time for these performance obligations. Certain eligible, nonrecurring costs incurred in the initial phases of outsourcing contracts and other cloud-based services contracts (i.e., setup costs) are capitalized when the costs relate directly to the contract, the costs generate or enhance resources of the company that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future, and the costs are expected to be recovered. These costs consist of transition and setup costs related to the installation of systems and processes and other deferred fulfillment costs, including, prepaid assets used in services contracts (i.e., prepaid software or prepaid maintenance), and other deferred fulfillment costs eligible for capitalization. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of 


Table of Contents 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 

benefit, which includes anticipated contract renewals or extensions, consistent with the transfer to the client of the services to which the asset relates. Additionally, fixed assets associated with these contracts are capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset. If an asset is contract specific, then the depreciation period is the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the contract term. Amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair value of acquired assets used in outsourcing arrangements are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of revenue over the expected period of benefit. The company performs periodic reviews to assess the recoverability of deferred contract transition and setup costs. This review is done by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the remaining amount of consideration the company expects to receive for the services to which the asset relates, less the costs that relate directly to providing those services that have not yet been recognized. If the carrying amount is deemed not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized. 

In situations in which an outsourcing contract is terminated, the terms of the contract may require the client to reimburse the company for the recovery of unbilled accounts receivable, unamortized deferred costs incurred to purchase specific assets utilized in the delivery of services and to pay any additional costs incurred by the company to transition the services. 

Software Costs 

Certain eligible, non-recurring costs incurred in the initial phases of Software-as-a-Service contracts are deferred and amortized over the expected period of benefit, which includes anticipated contract renewals or extensions, consistent with the policy described for Services Costs. Recurring operating costs in these contracts are recognized as incurred. 

Incremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract 

Incremental costs of obtaining a contract (e.g., sales commissions) are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected customer relationship period if the company expects to recover those costs. The company previously expensed these costs as incurred. The expected customer relationship is determined based on the average customer relationship period, including expected renewals, for each offering type and ranges from three to six years. Expected renewal periods are only included in the expected customer relationship period if commission amounts paid upon renewal are not commensurate with amounts paid on the initial contract. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs the company incurs to obtain a contract that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The company has determined that certain commissions programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Some commission programs are not subject to capitalization as the commission expense is paid and recognized as the related revenue is recognized. Additionally, as a practical expedient, the company expenses costs to obtain a contract as incurred if the amortization period would have been a year or less. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Product Warranties 

The company offers warranties for its hardware products that generally range up to three years, with the majority being either one or three years. Estimated costs for standard warranty terms are recognized when revenue is recorded for the related product. The company estimates its warranty costs standard to the product based on historical warranty claim experience and estimates of future spending, and applies this estimate to the revenue stream for products under warranty. Estimated future costs for warranties applicable to revenue recognized in the current period are charged to cost of sales. The warranty liability is reviewed quarterly to verify that it properly reflects the remaining obligation based on the anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period. Adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates. Costs from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty contracts, are recognized as incurred. 

Revenue from extended warranty contracts is initially recorded as deferred income and subsequently recognized on a straight-line basis over the delivery period because the company is providing a service of standing ready to provide services over such term. 

Contract Assets and Notes and Accounts ReceivableTrade 

The company classifies the right to consideration in exchange for products or services transferred to a client as either a receivable or a contract asset. A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional as compared to a contract asset which is a right to consideration that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. The majority of the companys contract assets represent unbilled amounts related to design and build services contracts when the cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition is utilized, revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client, and the right to consideration is subject to milestone completion or client acceptance. Contract assets are generally classified as current and are recorded on a net basis with deferred income (i.e., contract liabilities) at the contract level. At January 1, 2018 and June 


Table of Contents 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 

30, 2018 contract assets of $557 million and $515 million, respectively, are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. At December 31, 2017, these assets were classified as notes and accounts receivable-trade in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. 

An allowance for contract assets, if needed, and uncollectible trade receivables is estimated based on a combination of write-off history, aging analysis and any specific, known troubled accounts.

Remaining Performance Obligations 

The remaining performance obligation (RPO) disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized as of the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the company expects to recognize these amounts in revenue. It is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract that has not yet been performed and does not include contracts in which the customer is not committed, such as certain as-a-Service, governmental, term software license and services offerings. The customer is not considered committed when they are able to terminate for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty. The disclosure includes estimates of variable consideration, except when the variable consideration is a sales-based or usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property. Additionally, as a practical expedient, the company does not include contracts that have an original duration of one year or less. Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency. 

At June 30, 2018, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to RPO related to customer contracts that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied was $124 billion. Given the profile of contract terms, approximately 60 percent of this amount is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next two years, approximately 35 percent between three and five

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 

years and the balance (mostly Infrastructure Services) thereafter. Currency market volatility significantly impacted the amount of RPO at June 30, 2018 compared to March 31, 2018. 

Revenue Recognized for Performance Obligations Satisfied (or Partially Satisfied) in Prior Periods 

For the three and six months ending June 30, 2018, the impact to revenue from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods was immaterial. See pages 14 and 15 for additional information on percentage-of-completion contracts and estimates of costs to complete. 

Reconciliation of Contract Balances 




The amount of revenue recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2018 that was included within the deferred income balance at April 1, 2018 was $4.0 billion and primarily relates to services and software. 

The amount of revenue recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2018 that was included within the deferred income balance at January 1, 2018 was $6.0 billion and primarily relates to services and software. 

Deferred Costs 



On January 1, 2018, in accordance with the transition guidance, $737 million of in-scope sales commissions that were previously recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings were capitalized as costs to obtain a contract. 

The amount of total deferred costs amortized during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 was $953 million. There were no material impairment losses incurred during the period. Refer to pages 16 and 17 for additional information on deferred costs to fulfill a contract and capitalized costs of obtaining a contract. 

Transition Disclosures 

In accordance with the modified retrospective method transition requirements, the company will present the financial statement line items impacted and adjusted to compare to presentation under the prior GAAP for each of the interim and annual periods during the first year of adoption of the new revenue standard. The following tables summarize the impacts as of and for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018. The impacts to adjust to prior GAAP are primarily the result of the transition adjustments recorded at adoption. Current period impacts were not material. Refer to note 2, Accounting Changes, for additional information on the transition adjustments.

Fair Value Measurements 


· Level 1Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at the measurement date; 

· Level 2Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and 

· Level 3Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 

The guidance requires the use of observable market data if such data is available without undue cost and effort. 

When available, the company uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets to measure the fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. 

The determination of fair value considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and time value underlying the financial instruments. For derivatives and debt securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using discount rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument. 


· Counterparty credit risk adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into account the actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument. 

· Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect the companys own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the companys own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market. 

As an example, the fair value of derivatives is derived utilizing a discounted cash flow model that uses observable market inputs such as known notional value amounts, yield curves, spot and forward exchange rates as well as discount rates. These inputs relate to liquid, heavily traded currencies with active markets which are available for the full term of the derivative. 

Certain assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis can be subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. These assets include available-for-sale debt securities that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In the event of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security, fair value is measured using a model described above. 

Certain non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment, land, goodwill and intangible assets are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. The impairment models used for nonfinancial

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 

assets depend on the type of asset. There were no material impairments of non-financial assets for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Accounting guidance permits the measurement of eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. This election is irrevocable. The company has not applied the fair value option to any eligible assets or liabilities. 

Effective January 1, 2018, the company adopted the new FASB guidance on recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments using the cumulative catch-up transition method. Under the new standard, the company measures equity investments at fair value with changes recognized in net income. Based on the method of adoption, prior year information has not been updated to conform with the new guidance. Refer to note 2, Accounting Changes, for further information. 

The following tables present the companys financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017. 

Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value 

Short-Term Receivables and Payables 

Notes and other accounts receivable and other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) are financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, except for short-term debt, which would be classified as Level 2. 

Loans and Long-term Receivables 

Fair values are based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates offered for similar loans to clients with similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value for loans and long-term receivables was immaterial. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Long-Term Debt 

Fair value of publicly-traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market. For other long-term debt for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term debt was $37,851 million and $39,837 million, and the estimated fair value was $39,554 million and $42,264 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. If measured at fair 


Table of Contents 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 

value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Available-for-sale securities 


The contractual maturities of substantially all available-for-sale debt securities are less than one year at June 30, 2018. 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The company operates in multiple functional currencies and is a significant lender and borrower in the global markets. In the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, and to a lesser extent equity and commodity price changes and client credit risk. The company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives, and, where cost effective, financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align rate movements between the interest rates associated with the companys lease and other financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing debt. Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. 

As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based upon their overall credit profile. The companys established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The right of set-off that exists under certain of these arrangements enables the legal entities of the company subject to the arrangement to net amounts due to and from the counterparty reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty default. 

The company is also a party to collateral security arrangements with most of its major derivative counterparties. These arrangements require the company to hold or post collateral (cash or U.S. Treasury securities) when the derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds. Posting thresholds can be fixed or can vary based on credit default swap pricing or credit ratings received from the major credit agencies. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments under these collateralized arrangements that were in a liability position at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $24 million and $126 million, respectively, for which no collateral was posted at either date. Full collateralization of these agreements would be required in the event that the companys credit rating falls below investment grade or if its credit default swap spread exceeds 250 basis points, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the collateral security arrangements. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments in asset positions at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $699 million and $942 million, respectively. This amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting date if the counterparties failed to perform as contracted. This exposure was reduced by $201 million and $255 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, of liabilities included in master netting arrangements with those counterparties. Additionally, at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, this exposure was reduced by $63 million and $114 million of cash collateral, respectively. There were no non-cash collateral balances in U.S. Treasury securities at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the net exposure related to derivative assets recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $436 million and $572 million, respectively. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the net position related to derivative liabilities recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position was $55 million and $160 million, respectively. 

In the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair values of the related derivative instruments. No amount was recognized in other receivables at June 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017 for the right to reclaim cash collateral. The amount recognized in accounts payable for the obligation to return cash collateral was $63 million and $114 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The company restricts the use of cash collateral received to rehypothecation, and therefore reports it in restricted cash in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. No amount was rehypothecated at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 

The company may employ derivative instruments to hedge the volatility in stockholders equity resulting from changes in currency exchange rates of significant foreign subsidiaries of the company with respect to the U.S. dollar. These instruments, designated as net investment hedges, expose the company to liquidity risk as the derivatives have an immediate cash flow impact upon maturity which is not offset by a cash flow from the translation of the underlying hedged equity. The company monitors this cash loss potential on an ongoing basis and may discontinue some of these hedging relationships by de-designating or terminating the derivative instrument in order to manage the liquidity risk. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company may utilize derivatives to offset the changes in the fair value of the de-designated instruments from the date of de-designation until maturity. 

In its hedging programs, the company uses forward contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, and options depending upon the underlying exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged derivative instruments. 

A brief description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk, follows. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Fixed and Variable Rate Borrowings 

The company issues debt in the global capital markets to fund its operations and financing business. Access to cost-effective financing can result in interest rate mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce overall interest cost, the company may use interest-rate swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow hedges). At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the total notional amount of the companys interest rate swaps was $9.9 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was approximately 4.5 years and 4.8 years, respectively. These interest-rate contracts were accounted for as fair value hedges. The company did not have any cash flow hedges relating to this program outstanding at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 

Forecasted Debt Issuance 

The company is exposed to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances. To manage this risk, the company may use forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuance. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The company did not have any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 

Foreign Exchange Risk 

Long-Term Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net Investment) 

A large portion of the companys foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the functional currency of major foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. The company also uses cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for this risk management purpose. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was $6.9 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately 0.2 years at both periods. 

Anticipated Royalties and Cost Transactions 

The companys operations generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the companys non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the company. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is four years. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the total notional amount of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost transactions was $8.4 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was 0.7 years at both periods. 


Table of Contents 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 

At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, in connection with cash flow hedges of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net gains of $233 million and net gains of $27 million (before taxes), respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $192 million (before taxes) of deferred net gains on derivatives in AOCI at June 30, 2018, will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions. 

Foreign Currency Denominated Borrowings 

The company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated debt. To manage this risk, the company employs cross-currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The maximum length of time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is approximately ten years. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the total notional amount of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated debt was $6.5 billion at both periods. 

At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, in connection with cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings, the company recorded net gains of $129 million and net gains of $42 million (before taxes), respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $187 million (before taxes) of deferred net gains on derivatives in AOCI at June 30, 2018, will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying exposure. 


The company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers principally use currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion of the companys nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these forward and swap contracts are generally less than one year. The changes in the fair values of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are generally offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was $8.7 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively. 

Equity Risk Management 


Other Risks 

The company may hold warrants to purchase shares of common stock in connection with various investments that are deemed derivatives because they contain net share or net cash settlement provisions. The company records the changes in the fair value of these warrants in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any warrants qualifying as derivatives outstanding at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 

The company is exposed to a potential loss if a client fails to pay amounts due under contractual terms. The company may utilize credit default swaps to economically hedge its credit exposures. The swaps are recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The company did not have any derivative instruments relating to this program outstanding at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 

The company is exposed to market volatility on certain investment securities. The company may utilize options or forwards to economically hedge its market exposure. The derivatives are recorded at fair value with gains and losses reported

Financing Receivables by Portfolio Segment 



Write-offs of lease receivables and loan receivables were $4 million and $2 million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Provisions for credit losses recorded for lease receivables and loan receivables were $9 million and $18 million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2018. 

The average recorded investment of impaired leases and loans for Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific was $128 million, $55 million and $78 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and $176 million, $28 million and $132 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Both interest income recognized and interest income recognized on a cash basis on impaired leases and loans were immaterial for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. 

The average recorded investment of impaired leases and loans for Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific was $128 million, $56 million and $80 million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and $173 million, $25 million and $141 million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2017. Both interest income recognized and interest income recognized on a cash basis on impaired leases and loans were immaterial for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. 


Table of Contents 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 


Write-offs of lease receivables and loan receivables were $55 million and $82 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Provisions for credit losses recorded for lease receivables and loan receivables were $9 million and $7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

When determining the allowances, financing receivables are evaluated either on an individual or a collective basis. For individually evaluated receivables, the company determines the expected cash flow for the receivable and calculates an estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts in which the loss is probable, the company records a specific reserve. The company considers any receivable with an individually evaluated reserve as an impaired receivable. 


Past Due Financing Receivables 

The company considers a clients financing receivable balance past due when any installment is aged over 90 days. The following table summarizes information about the recorded investment in lease and loan financing receivables, including recorded investments aged over 90 days and still accruing, billed invoices aged over 90 days and recorded investment not accruing.

Credit Quality Indicators 

The companys credit quality indicators, which are based on rating agency data, publicly available information and information provided by customers, are reviewed periodically based on the relative level of risk. The resulting indicators are a numerical rating system that maps to Moodys Investors Service credit ratings as shown below. The company uses information provided by Moodys, where available, as one of many inputs in its determination of customer credit ratings. 

The following tables present the recorded investment net of allowance for credit losses for each class of receivables, by credit quality indicator, at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Receivables with a credit quality indicator ranging from Aaa to Baa3 are considered investment grade. All others are considered non-investment grade. The credit quality indicators do not reflect mitigation actions that the company takes to transfer credit risk to third parties.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

The company did not have any significant troubled debt restructurings during the six months ended June 30, 2018 or for the year ended December 31, 2017. 



Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three months ended June 30, 2018 decreased $10 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. This was due to decreases related to restricted stock units ($7 million), performance share units ($2 million), and the conversion of stock-based awards previously issued by acquired entities ($1 million). 

Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the six months ended June 30, 2018 decreased $23 million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. This was due to decreases related to restricted stock units ($12 million), performance share units ($8 million), and the conversion of stock-based awards previously issued by acquired entities ($3 million). 

As of June 30, 2018, the total unrecognized compensation cost of $965 million related to non-vested awards was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.7 years.

In 2018, the company expects to contribute approximately $400 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans, the largest of which will be contributed to the defined benefit pension plans in the UK, Japan and Spain. This amount generally represents the legally mandated minimum contribution. Total contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the first six months of 2018 were $237 million, of which $80 million was in cash and $157 million in U.S. Treasury securities. Total net contributions to the non-U.S. plans in the first six months of 2017 were $263 million, of which $87 million was in cash and $176 million in U.S. Treasury securities. The contribution of U.S. Treasury securities is considered a non-cash transaction in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Cost of Nonpension Postretirement Plans 





The company contributed $215 million in U.S. Treasury securities to the U.S. nonpension postretirement benefit plan during the six months ended June 30, 2018, and $230 million in U.S. Treasury securities during the six months ended June 30, 2017. The contribution of U.S. Treasury securities is considered a non-cash transaction in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 



Each acquisition is expected to enhance the companys portfolio of product and services capabilities. Armanta is a provider of aggregation and analytics software to financial institutions, enabling data aggregation across multiple systems in near real-time speed, enhancing decision-making and improving regulatory compliance. Oniqua is a global innovator in maintenance-repair-operate inventory optimization solutions and services for asset-intensive industries. All of these acquisitions were for 100 percent of the acquired businesses. 

The acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method, and accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity were recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The acquisitions did not have a material impact in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

There were no goodwill impairment losses recorded during the first six months of 2018 or the full year of 2017 and the company has no accumulated impairment losses. 

Purchase price adjustments recorded in the first six months of 2018 and full year 2017 were related to acquisitions that were completed on or prior to March 31, 2018 or September 30, 2017, respectively, and were still subject to the measurement period that ends at the earlier of 12 months from the acquisition date or when information becomes available. Net purchase price adjustments recorded during the first six months of 2018 were not material. Net purchase price adjustments of $38 million were recorded during 2017, with the primary drivers being deferred tax assets, other taxes payable and other current liabilities associated with the Truven Health Analytics, Inc. and The Weather Company acquisitions. 


Short-Term Debt 


The weighted-average interest rate for commercial paper at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was 2.1 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate for short-term loans was 8.9 percent and 8.8 percent at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

Long-Term Debt 

Pre-Swap Borrowing 




There are no debt securities issued and outstanding by IBM International Group Capital LLC, which is an indirect, 100 percent owned finance subsidiary of International Business Machines Corporation, the parent. Any debt securities issued by IBM International Group Capital LLC, would be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the parent. 

During the third quarter of 2017, IBM Credit LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allowing it to offer for sale public debt securities. In 2017, IBM Credit LLC issued fixed- and floating-rate debt securities in the aggregate amount of $3.0 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2019 to 2022. During the first quarter of 2018, IBM Credit LLC issued fixed- and floating-rate debt securities in the aggregate amount of $2.0 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2023. This debt is included in the long-term debt table above. 

The companys indenture governing its debt securities and its various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and

sale and leaseback transactions to 10 percent of the companys consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict the companys ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on the companys consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million. 

The company is in compliance with all of its significant debt covenants and provides periodic certifications to its lenders. The failure to comply with its debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable. 



Interest on Debt 


Lines of Credit 

On July 19, 2018, the company amended its existing $10.25 billion Five-Year Credit Agreement. In addition, the company and IBM Credit LLC entered into a new $2.5 billion, 364-Day Credit Agreement, to replace the maturing $2.5 billion, 364-Day agreement, and also amended the existing $2.5 billion Three-Year Credit Agreement. The amended Five-Year and Three-Year credit agreements included a modification of terms to account for the potential discontinuation of LIBOR and to extend the maturity dates. The new maturity dates for the Five-Year and Three-Year Credit Agreements are July 20, 2023 and July 20, 2021, respectively. Each of the facility sizes remained unchanged. 


The company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Any recorded liabilities, including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 

In accordance with the relevant accounting guidance, the company provides disclosures of matters for which the likelihood of material loss is at least reasonably possible. In addition, the company also discloses matters based on its consideration of other matters and qualitative factors, including the experience of other companies in the industry, and investor, customer and employee relations considerations. 




The following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the company. 


On May 13, 2010, IBM and the State of Indiana (acting on behalf of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration) sued one another in a dispute over a 2006 contract regarding the modernization of social service program processing in Indiana. After six weeks of trial, on July 18, 2012, the Indiana Superior Court in Marion County rejected the States claims in their entirety and awarded IBM $52 million plus interest and costs. On February 13, 2014, the Indiana Court of Appeals reversed portions of the trial judges findings, found IBM in material breach, and ordered the case remanded to the trial judge to determine the States damages, if any. The Indiana Court of Appeals also affirmed approximately $50 million of the trial courts award of damages to IBM. On March 22, 2016, the Indiana Supreme Court affirmed the outcome of the Indiana Court of Appeals and remanded the case to the Indiana Superior Court. On August 7, 2017, the Indiana Superior Court awarded the State $128 million, which it then offset against IBMs previously affirmed award of $50 million, resulting in a $78 million award to the State, plus interest. Both parties appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals and the matter remains pending. 

On March 9, 2017, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvanias Department of Labor and Industry sued IBM in Pennsylvania state court regarding a 2006 contract for the development of a custom software system to manage the Commonwealths unemployment insurance benefits programs. The matter is pending in a Pennsylvania court.

On October 29, 2013, Bridgestone Americas, Inc. (Bridgestone) sued IBM regarding a 2009 contract for the implementation of an SAP-based, enterprise-wide order management system. IBM counterclaimed against Bridgestone and its parent, Bridgestone Corp. IBM and Bridgestone have resolved the case and all claims have been dismissed. 

Following the 2017 final judgment of the Appeal Court in London holding that IBM UK acted lawfully in 2010 in closing its UK defined benefit plans to future accruals for most participants and in implementing a new retirement policy, the Employment Tribunal in Southampton UK is expected to address approximately 290 individual actions alleging constructive dismissal and age discrimination brought against IBM UK in 2010 by employees who left the company at that time. The individual actions were previously stayed. 

In May 2015, a putative class action was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York related to the companys October 2014 announcement that it was divesting its global commercial semiconductor technology business, alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Managements Retirement Plans Committee and three current or former IBM executives are named as defendants. On September 29, 2017, the Court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the first amended complaint. Plaintiffs appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and the matter remains pending. 

In August 2015, IBM learned that the SEC was conducting an investigation relating to revenue recognition with respect to the accounting treatment of certain transactions in the U.S., UK and Ireland. The company cooperated with the SEC in this matter. In May 2018, the SEC informed IBM that based on the information to date, it closed its investigation into this matter without pursuing any enforcement action against the company. 

The company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and claims concerning certain current or former operating sites. 

The company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax litigation matters. The total potential amount related to all these matters for all applicable years is approximately $900 million. The company believes it will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of liability. 


The company has applied the guidance requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantors performance is remote. The following is a description of arrangements in which the company is the guarantor. 


It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the companys obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular 


Table of Contents 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 

agreement. Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on the companys business, financial condition or results of operations. 

In addition, the company guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment under these financial guarantees was $17 million and $19 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The fair value of the guarantees recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is not material. 

Changes in the companys warranty liability for standard warranties and deferred income for extended warranty are presented in the following tables. 

Standard Warranty Liability 


Extended Warranty Liability 





The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017 decreased $1,013 million in the first six months of 2018 to $6,018 million. The decrease was primarily driven by the resolution of certain tax matters in the first quarter of 2018 related to the U.S. audits described above. The liability at June 30, 2018 of $6,018 million can be reduced by $597 million of 


Table of Contents 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (continued) 

offsetting tax benefits associated with timing adjustments, U.S. tax credits, potential transfer pricing adjustments and state income taxes. The net amount of $5,421 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the companys effective tax rate. 

The company is involved in a number of income tax-related matters in India challenging tax assessments issued by the India Tax Authorities. As of June 30, 2018, the company has recorded $650 million as prepaid income taxes in India. A significant portion of this balance represents cash tax deposits paid over time to protect the companys right to appeal various income tax assessments made by the India Tax Authorities. The company believes it will prevail on these matters. 

U.S. Tax Reform 

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted. U.S. tax reform introduced many changes, including lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent, changes in incentives, provisions to prevent U.S. base erosion and significant changes in the taxation of international income, including provisions which allow for the repatriation of foreign earnings without U.S. tax. The enactment of U.S. tax reform resulted in the company recording a provisional tax expense charge of $5,475 million in the fourth-quarter and year-ended December 31, 2017. This charge was the result of the one-time U.S. transition tax and any foreign tax costs on undistributed foreign earnings, as well as the remeasurement of deferred tax balances to the new U.S. federal tax rate. 

All components of the provisional charge of $5,475 million were based on the companys estimates as of December 31, 2017. Specifically, the transition tax, any foreign tax costs, as well as the remeasurement of deferred tax balances are provisional and were calculated based on existing tax law and the best information available as of the date of estimate. The effect of U.S. tax reform changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities was a benefit of $270 million and was included in the one-time charge. An additional provisional charge of $107 million was recorded in the first quarter as a result of IRS guidance issued in January 2018 and a benefit of $14 million was recorded in the second quarter as a result of IRS guidance issued in early April 2018. The final impact of U.S. tax reform may differ, possibly materially, due to factors such as changes in interpretations and assumptions that the company has made in its assessment, conclusion of the effects of the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions, further refinement of the companys calculations, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. government, among other items. The company is still evaluating the Acts GILTI provisions and has not yet elected an accounting policy. 

As these various factors are finalized, any change will be recorded as an adjustment to the provision for, or benefit from, income taxes in the period the amounts are determined, not to exceed 12 months from the date of U.S. tax reform enactment. The company has not completed its assessment and the tax charge remains provisional as of June 30, 2018.

Stock options to purchase 388,681 shares and 22,625 shares were outstanding as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options exercise price during the respective period was greater than the average market price of the common shares, and, therefore, the effect would have been antidilutive.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

 OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Snapshot 





nm - not meaningful 


Effective January 1, 2018, the company adopted the FASB guidance on presentation of net periodic pension and nonpension postretirement benefit costs (net benefit cost). The guidance is primarily a change in financial statement presentation, but it did impact the consolidated and reportable segment gross profit margins and expense and other income. As a result, the company aligned its presentation of operating (non-GAAP) earnings to conform to the FASB presentation of these costs in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The periods presented in this Form 10-Q are reported on a comparable basis. The company filed a Form 8-K on March 29, 2018 to recast its historical consolidated and segment information to reflect the change. 


The references to adjusted for currency or at constant currency in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. When the company refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusts such growth rates for currency, it is done so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of its business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year periods currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates. Refer to Currency Rate Fluctuations on pages 85 and 86 for additional information.

Management Discussion  (continued) 



Overall, the company believes that providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the companys pension plans; improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows the company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. The companys reportable segment financial results reflect operating earnings from continuing operations, consistent with the companys management and measurement system. 

The following table provides the companys (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the second quarter of 2018 and 2017. 




nm - not meaningful 


In the second quarter of 2018, the company reported $20.0 billion in revenue, $2.4 billion in income from continuing operations and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $2.8 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.61 as reported and $3.08 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The company also generated $2.3 billion in cash from operations and $1.9 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter of 2018 and delivered shareholder returns of $2.4 billion through gross common stock repurchases and dividends. With good revenue and profit growth, the second-quarter results demonstrate that the company is capturing high-value growth with unique differentiation of innovative

technology combined with deep industry expertise underpinned by trust and security  all delivered through its integrated business model. 

Total consolidated revenue increased 3.7 percent as reported and 1.6 percent adjusted for currency, reflecting the companys highest constant currency growth in seven years. There was continued momentum in revenue across the strategic imperatives in the second quarter, led by cloud and security. 


Strategic imperatives revenue of $10.1 billion increased 15 percent as reported and 13 percent adjusted for currency in the second quarter, led by cloud and security. Cloud revenue of $4.7 billion increased 20 percent (18 percent adjusted for currency) driven by as-a-Service revenue which grew 26 percent as reported and 24 percent adjusted for currency. The annual exit run rate for as-a-Service revenue increased to $11.1 billion in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $8.8 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Security grew 81 percent as reported (79 percent adjusted for currency) driven by strong demand for the pervasive encryption of IBM Z and growth in integrated software and services. Analytics revenue of $5.4 billion increased 7 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for currency. Mobile revenue increased 5 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency. 


The consolidated gross margin of 46.0 percent decreased 0.5 points year to year. The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 46.5 percent decreased 0.6 points year to year with approximately half of this impact driven by revenue mix and half driven by continued investments to build out the IBM Cloud. Productivity had minimal benefit to the year-to-year gross margin dynamics this quarter with actions taken in the first quarter expected to yield savings in the second half of 2018. 

Total expense and other (income) decreased 1.6 percent in the second quarter of 2018. The year-to-year decrease was due to lower spending (5 points) as the company continues to realize acquisition synergies and drives operational efficiencies by streamlining its management system, scaling agile and implementing new ways of working. This benefit was partially offset by the effects of currency (2 points) and a lower level of intellectual property (IP) income (2 points). Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 2.1 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors. 

Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2.8 billion increased 13.6 percent and the pre-tax margin was 13.9 percent, an increase of 1.2 points year to year. The continuing operations effective tax rate was 13.5 percent compared to 4.5 percent in the second quarter of 2017. The prior year tax rate included discrete tax benefits in the second quarter of $170 million. Income from continuing operations of $2.4 billion increased 3.0 percent and the net income margin was 12.0 percent, a decrease of 0.1 points versus the second quarter of 2017. Net income of $2.4 billion increased 3.1 percent year to year. 

Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $3.4 billion increased 10.9 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations increased 1.1 points to 16.9 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $2.8 billion increased 2.7 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income

margin from continuing operations of 14.2 percent, a decline of 0.1 points year to year. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2018 was 16.0 percent. 

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.61 increased 5.2 percent year to year. In the second quarter of 2018, the company repurchased 6.7 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.0 billion and had $2.0 billion remaining in the current share repurchase authorization at June 30, 2018. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $3.08 increased 4.8 percent versus the second quarter of 2017. 

The company generated $2.3 billion in cash flow provided by operating activities, a decrease of $1.2 billion compared to the second quarter of 2017, driven primarily by a decrease in cash provided by receivables and an increase in cash income tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities of $0.6 billion in the second quarter of 2018 was $1.0 billion lower than the prior year, primarily driven by net non-operating financing receivables ($1.3 billion). Net cash used in financing activities of $2.5 billion increased $1.9 billion compared to the second quarter of 2017, driven primarily by an increase in net cash used for debt transactions ($2.3 billion) driven by a lower level of debt issuances; partially offset by a decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases ($0.4 billion). 

The company expects GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of at least $11.60, and continues to expect operating (non-GAAP) earnings of at least $13.80 per diluted share for 2018. The company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2018. Free cash flow realization is expected to be in excess of 100 percent of GAAP net income. Refer to page 87 in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information on this non-GAAP measure. Refer to the Looking Forward section on pages 84 and 85 for additional information on the companys expectations.

The following table provides the companys (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first six months of 2018 and 2017. 




nm - not meaningful 


In the first six months of 2018, the company reported $39.1 billion in revenue, and delivered $4.1 billion in income from continuing operations, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.42 as reported and $5.53 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The company generated $6.9 billion in cash from operations and $3.2 billion in free cash flow in the first six months of 2018 and delivered shareholder returns of $4.6 billion through gross common stock repurchases and dividends. 

Total consolidated revenue increased 4.4 percent year to year as reported and 0.8 percent adjusted for currency in the first six months of 2018. The company continued to have solid revenue growth in its strategic imperatives, led by cloud and security. 


In the first six months of 2018, the companys strategic imperatives revenue increased 15 percent year to year as reported and 12 percent adjusted for currency. Strategic imperatives revenue over the last 12 months was $39.0 billion, an increase of 15 percent as reported and 12 percent adjusted for currency, representing 48 percent of the companys total revenue. Total Cloud revenue in the first six months of 2018 of $8.9 billion increased 20 percent year to year as reported and 16 percent adjusted for currency, with as-a-Service revenue up 25 percent (22 percent adjusted for currency). Analytics revenue of $10.3 billion increased 7 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for currency. Mobile revenue increased 11 percent year to year (8 percent adjusted for currency) and Security revenue increased 74 percent as reported (70 percent adjusted for currency). 

From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue was flat year to year as reported and adjusted for currency with a modest decline in the U.S. offset by growth in Canada and Latin America. EMEA increased 12.2 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency with growth as reported and adjusted for currency in Germany, France, the UK and Spain. Asia Pacific increased 3.2 percent as reported and was flat adjusted for currency, with Japan up 3.5 percent as reported and flat adjusted for currency. China grew as reported (declined 2 percent adjusted for currency) and India declined as reported and adjusted for currency.

Management Discussion  (continued) 

The consolidated gross margin of 44.6 percent decreased 0.5 points year to year. The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 45.1 percent decreased 0.7 points versus the prior year. The margin declines were primarily driven by continued cloud investment and portfolio mix. 

Total expense and other (income) increased $0.5 billion or 3.7 percent in the first six months of 2018 compared to the prior year. The year-to-year increase included a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges (3 points), an impact from currency (3 points), and a lower level of IP income (2 points), partially offset by lower spending (4 points) driven by acquisition synergies and operational efficiencies. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 3.7 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors. 

Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $3.9 billion increased 1.2 percent and the pre-tax margin was 10.0 percent, a decrease of 0.3 points versus the first six months of 2017. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first six months of 2018 was (4.3) percent compared to (5.6) percent in the prior year. The negative tax rate in the first six months of 2018 was primarily driven by the first-quarter 2018 resolution of certain tax matters related to the U.S. federal audit of the companys 2013 and 2014 tax returns and the completion of the U.S. federal audit of amended tax returns filed for prior years ($0.8 billion); partially offset by a net provisional charge ($0.1 billion) as a result of 2018 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance related to U.S. tax reform. The prior year negative tax rate was primarily driven by discrete tax items ($0.7 billion), including the first-quarter 2017 intra-entity transfer of assets ($0.6 billion). Income from continuing operations of $4.1 billion decreased 0.2 percent and the net income margin was 10.4 percent, a decrease of 0.5 points compared to the first six months of 2017. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $5 million in the first six months of 2018 versus a loss of $3 million in the prior-year period. Net income of $4.1 billion was flat year to year. 

Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $5.1 billion increased 0.8 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 0.5 points to 13.1 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $5.1 billion increased 2.4 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 13.1 percent decreased 0.2 points. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in the first six months of 2018 was 0.2 percent versus 1.8 percent in the first six months of 2017. 

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.42 increased 2.3 percent year to year. In the first six months of 2018, the company repurchased 11.7 million shares of its common stock and had $2.0 billion remaining in the current share repurchase authorization at June 30, 2018. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $5.53 increased 4.7 percent versus the prior year.

The company generated $6.9 billion in cash flows provided by operating activities, a decrease of $0.5 billion compared to the first six months of 2017, driven primarily by an increase in cash income tax payments ($0.7 billion) and a decrease in cash provided by financing receivables ($0.4 billion); partially offset by working capital performance ($0.5 billion). Net cash used in investing activities of $2.4 billion was $1.0 billion higher than the prior year, primarily driven by net non-operating financing receivables ($0.4 billion), an increase in net capital investments ($0.3 billion) and an increase in net purchases of marketable securities and other investments ($0.3 billion). Net cash used in financing activities of $5.4 billion increased $2.7 billion compared to the first six months of 2017, driven by lower net debt issuances ($3.5 billion); partially offset by a decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases ($1.0 billion).

industry verticals and grow its Software-as-a-Service offerings. There was growth in key areas, such as analytics, Watson platforms and industry-specific solutions, which continue to scale. This was offset by transition in other areas, including talent, collaboration and commerce, as the company continues to modernize these offerings in response to secular market shifts. Within Solutions Software, analytics grew year-to-year as reported and adjusted for currency driven by growth in the DB2 portfolio, data science offerings and the new IBM Cloud Private for Data offering, which makes data ready for AI. Within industry solutions, strong growth was led by Watson Financial Services, which leverages businesses expertise to help clients manage increasing regulatory requirements and Watson IoT, as the business continues to embed AI across the IoT portfolio. Transaction Processing Software revenue of $1,366 million was flat as reported, but declined 2 percent adjusted for currency, driven by declines in Storage software partially offset by growth in IBM Z and Power Systems middleware. 

Cognitive Solutions second-quarter strategic imperatives revenue of $3.0 billion grew 1 percent year to year as reported, but was flat adjusted for currency. Cloud revenue of $0.6 billion was flat as reported, but declined 1 percent adjusted for currency, with an as-a-Service exit run rate of $2.0 billion. For the first six months of the year, Cognitive Solutions strategic imperatives revenue of $5.8 billion grew 4 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency. Cloud revenue of $1.2 billion grew 3 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency. 





Cognitive Solutions gross profit margin decreased 1.3 points to 77.7 percent in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year. For the first six months of 2018, gross profit margin decreased 1.2 points to 77.0 percent. The gross profit margin decline in both periods was driven by continued investment in key strategic areas, including AI, security and blockchain, and a higher level of royalty cost associated with IP licensing agreements compared to the prior-year periods. 

In the second quarter, pre-tax income of $1,756 million increased 9.1 percent compared to the prior year with a pre-tax margin improvement of 2.4 points to 33.2 percent. For the first six months of the year, pre-tax income of $3,089 million increased 7.3 percent compared to the prior year with a pre-tax margin improvement of 1.0 points to 29.8 percent. The year-to-year benefit in the second quarter and the six-month period reflects operational efficiencies and acquisition synergies. The pre-tax margin for the six-month period was also impacted by 1.4 points from a higher level of charges related to workforce rebalancing in the first-quarter 2018.

Global Business Services 



Global Business Services revenue of $4,192 million increased 2.3 percent as reported and was flat adjusted for currency in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year. Although the revenue growth rate declined sequentially as reported in the second quarter versus the first quarter of 2018 on a year-to-year basis, there was a 1 point improvement in the second quarter versus the prior quarter on an adjusted for currency year-to-year basis. This was driven by the realization of revenue from the opening backlog at the beginning of the year. The company continued to realign its practice model around key growth platforms including digital transformation, cloud applications and cognitive processes. The digital business had continued growth during the second quarter compared to the prior-year period, driven by its Digital Business Strategy offerings, which help clients drive digital transformation, and Mobile offerings. For the first six months of the year, Global Business Services revenue of $8,365 million increased 3.2 percent as reported, but declined 1 percent adjusted for currency. 

In the second quarter, Consulting revenue of $1,931 million increased 6.0 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year led by the companys offerings in Cloud and Digital. Global Process Services (GPS) revenue of $315 million decreased 1.5 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year. Application Management revenue of $1,946 million decreased 0.5 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency). This decline was driven by the traditional Enterprise Application Managed Services, partially offset by growth in strategic offerings such as Cloud Migration Factory and Cloud Application Development. 

Second-quarter 2018 GBS strategic imperatives revenue of $2.7 billion grew 8 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency). Cloud revenue of $1.1 billion grew 10 percent as reported and 8 percent adjusted for currency, with an as-a-Service exit run rate of $1.4 billion. For the first six months of the year, GBS strategic imperatives revenue of $5.2 billion grew 10 percent as reported and 6 percent adjusted for currency year to year. Cloud revenue of $2.1 billion grew 14 percent as reported (10 percent adjusted for currency).

GBS second-quarter gross profit margin increased 1.3 points to 25.9 percent year to year. The company has been transforming the portfolio and repositioning offerings to capture price for value, and the business is realizing benefits from productivity actions. Pre-tax income of $385 million increased 23.7 percent year to year. Pre-tax margin increased 1.6 points to 9.0 percent. For the first six months of the year, pre-tax income of $530 million decreased 10.6 percent and pre-tax margin declined 1.0 points to 6.2 percent. Pre-tax margin for the first six months of 2018 included an impact of 1.2 points due to a higher level of charges related to workforce rebalancing in the first-quarter 2018, which is beginning to contribute to productivity around labor models and structure.

In the second quarter, Infrastructure Services revenue of $5,768 million increased 4.0 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, driven primarily by improved realization of revenue from backlog as the company shifts clients to the cloud. During the second-quarter 2018, the company announced the expansion of IBM Cloud capabilities to 18 availability zones across the world. This global expansion is important for clients to have the ability to better manage and control their data cloud journey as they implement hybrid cloud especially given increased data regulations. 

Technical Support Services second-quarter revenue of $1,750 million decreased 2.5 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) due in part to the dynamics of the IBM Z product cycle as clients move from maintenance to warranty for the first year, partially offset by continued growth in core multi-vendor support services. 

Integration Software second quarter revenue of $1,097 million increased 2.8 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year driven by good performance in offerings that modernize applications and enable cloud adoption, including IBM Cloud Private.

decreased 20.9 percent and pre-tax margin decreased 2.3 points to 7.5 percent. The year-to-year pre-tax margin in the first six months of 2018 compared to the prior year included an impact of 1.4 points from a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges in the first quarter which are expected to yield productivity benefits in the second half of 2018. 

Services Backlog and Signings 


The estimated total services backlog at June 30, 2018 was $116 billion, a decrease of 1.6 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency). Global Technology Services (GTS) backlog was essentially flat as reported and adjusted for currency year to year and GBS backlog declined year to year both as reported and adjusted for currency. 

Total services backlog includes Infrastructure Services, Consulting, Global Process Services, Application Management and Technical Support Services. Total backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract which is either non-cancellable, or which historically has very low likelihood of termination, given the criticality of certain services to the companys clients. Total backlog does not include as-a-Service arrangements that allow for termination under contractual commitment terms. Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and adjustments for currency. 

Services signings are managements initial estimate of the value of a clients commitment under a services contract. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a clients commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs. 

Signings include Infrastructure Services, Consulting, Global Process Services and Application Management contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Technical Support Services (TSS) are generally not included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues equal renewals. Certain longer-term TSS contracts that have characteristics similar to outsourcing contracts are included in signings. 

Contract portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments provided those contracts meet the companys requirements for initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

Systems 



Systems revenue of $2,177 million grew 24.6 percent as reported (23 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year. Systems Hardware revenue of $1,756 million grew 32.2 percent as reported (31 percent adjusted for currency) driven by continued broad-based z14 adoption, growth in Power Systems and a return to growth in Storage Systems, as reported and adjusted for currency. Operating Systems Software revenue of $421 million was essentially flat as reported, but declined 1 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year. For the first six months of 2018, Systems revenue of $3,676 million increased 17.0 percent as reported (14 percent adjusted for currency) with strong growth in Systems Hardware both as reported and adjusted for currency driven by IBM Z and Power Systems. Operating Systems Software increased 1.8 percent as reported, but declined 1 percent adjusted for currency, compared to the prior year. 

Second quarter IBM Z revenue grew 114.5 percent as reported (112 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, driven by new workload MIPS. The z14 adoption remained broad based, across most geographies and industries, with new clients added to the platform and existing clients growing and expanding workloads on the platform. The company continues to address emerging workloads across the IBM Z platform including blockchain, machine learning, dev ops and payments. The newly announced single-frame z14 designed specifically for cloud environments had good acceptance by clients during the second quarter. 

Power Systems grew revenue 5.0 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, driven by the new POWER9 entry-level portfolio and continued growth in Linux. Power Systems are designed for the cloud environment and provide leadership capability in advanced analytics and data intensive workloads in AI, HANA and UNIX markets. During the second quarter, the U.S. Department of Energy unveiled Summit, the most powerful commercially available supercomputer, built by IBM Systems with POWER9 technology. 

Storage Systems returned to growth in the second quarter with revenue up 3.7 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency) year to year. This growth was geographically broad based and led by double-digit growth in All Flash Arrays. 

Second-quarter Systems strategic imperatives revenue of $1.2 billion grew 57 percent year to year as reported (55 percent adjusted for currency). Cloud revenue of $0.8 billion grew 30 percent as reported (28 percent adjusted for currency). For the first six months of the year, Systems strategic imperatives revenue of $1.9 billion increased 45 percent as reported (42 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, primarily a reflection of the strong acceptance of the new z14. Cloud revenue of $1.3 billion increased 24 percent as reported and 22 percent adjusted for currency.

Systems gross profit margin decreased 2.1 points to 50.6 percent in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year, however, there was sequential improvement compared to the first quarter of 2018 (which declined 3.8 percent). The overall decrease year-to-year was driven by margin declines in Operating System Software, partially mitigated by an increase in Systems Hardware margins primarily due to mix toward high margin IBM Z. For the first six months of the year, Systems gross profit margin decreased 2.6 points to 47.8 percent compared to the prior year, driven by margin declines in Operating Systems Software. Systems Hardware gross profit margin was flat year to year, with declines in IBM Z and Storage Systems offset by margin improvement in Power Systems. 

In the second quarter of 2018, pre-tax income of $346 million grew 376.8 percent and pre-tax margin increased 10.5 points year to year to 14.3 percent driven primarily by the IBM Z product cycle. For the first six months of the year, pre-tax income of $143 million increased $258 million and pre-tax margin increased 6.8 points year to year to 3.5 percent also due to the IBM Z product cycle, partially offset by actions taken in the first quarter to better position the systems cost structure over the longer term, which impacted the pre-tax margin by 2.7 points. 

Global Financing 

Global Financing is a reportable segment that is measured as a stand-alone entity. Global Financing facilitates IBM clients acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has the expertise, while generating strong returns on equity. Global Financing also optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients. Sales of equipment include equipment returned at the end of a lease, surplus internal equipment and used equipment purchased externally. Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based upon this product information, Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.

Results of Operations 



In the second quarter of 2018, Global Financing total revenue of $867 million increased 23.0 percent compared to the prior year. Internal revenue increased 62.9 percent, driven by an increase in internal used equipment sales (up 77.6 percent to $373 million), and an increase in internal financing (up 24.2 percent to $100 million). External revenue decreased 4.9 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency), due to a decrease in external used equipment sales (down 21.2 percent to $95 million), partially offset by an increase in external financing (up 1.8 percent to $299 million). 

The increase in total revenue of $228 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 was due to an increase in internal revenue of 38.0 percent, driven by an increase in internal used equipment sales (up 46.2 percent to $698 million) and an increase in internal financing (up 16.0 percent to $204 million). External revenue decreased 2.5 percent (5 percent adjusted for currency), driven by a decline in external used equipment sales (down 18.3 percent to $187 million), partially offset by an increase in external financing (up 3.7 percent to $612 million). 

The year-to-year increases in internal financing revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were due to higher asset yields and higher average asset balances. The increases in external financing revenue in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to the same periods in 2017, respectively, were due to higher average asset balances, partially offset by lower asset yields. 

Total sales of used equipment represented 54.0 percent and 52.0 percent of Global Financings revenue in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to 46.9 percent and 48.0 percent in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively. The increases in both periods were due to a higher volume of used equipment sales for internal transactions. The gross profit margin on used sales was 58.3 percent and 50.5 percent in the second quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 58.6 percent and 51.0 percent in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in the gross profit margin was driven by a shift towards higher margin internal equipment sales. 

Global Financing pre-tax income increased 26.8 percent to $357 million in the second quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to higher gross profit of $95 million, partially offset by an increase in expense of $19 million. Pre-tax income increased 23.9 percent to $734 million in the first six months of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to higher gross profit of $154 million, partially offset by an increase in expense of $12 million. The increase in expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in financing receivables provisions due to higher reserve requirements in the current year. 

Global Financing return on equity was 31.2 percent and 31.9 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to 26.0 percent and 25.1 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. The increase in return on equity in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to the same periods of 2017, was due to the increase in net income, partially offset by an increase in equity. See page 88 for the details of the after-tax income and return on equity calculation. 

Total unguaranteed residual value of leases, including operating leases, was $686 million as of June 30, 2018. In addition to the unguaranteed residual value, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease. Third-party residual value guarantees increase the minimum lease payments as provided for by accounting standards that are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease, direct financing lease or operating lease. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees of sales-type leases were $134 million and $63 million for the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively and $156 million and $106 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Licensing of intellectual property including royalty-based fees decreased 40.7 percent and 37.3 percent year to year in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. The company entered into new partnership agreements in the first six months of 2018, which included two transactions with period income greater than $100 million. There was one transaction greater than $100 million in the first six months of 2017. The company licenses IP to partners who allocate their skills to extend the value of assets that are high value, but may be in mature markets. The timing and amount of licensing, sales or other transfers of IP may vary significantly from period to period depending upon the timing of licensing agreements, economic conditions, industry consolidation and the timing of new patents and know-how development.

Interest Expense 



Interest expense increased $26 million and $56 million year to year in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings if the related external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external business. Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was $367 million and $713 million, respectively, an increase of $47 million and $101 million versus the comparable prior year periods, primarily driven by a higher average debt balance and higher average interest rates. 

Retirement-Related Plans 





Table of Contents 

Management Discussion  (continued) 



In the second quarter of 2018, total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost increased by $39 million compared to the second quarter of 2017, primarily driven by lower expected return on plan assets ($66 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($26 million); partially offset by lower interest costs ($52 million). Total cost for the first six months of 2018 increased by $102 million versus the first six months of 2017, primarily driven by lower expected return on plan assets ($114 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($67 million), partially offset by lower interest costs ($93 million). 

As discussed in the Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings section on page 56, the company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in the second quarter of 2018 were $364 million, a decrease of $7 million compared to the second quarter of 2017, primarily driven by lower defined contribution plans cost ($7 million). Non-operating costs of $394 million in the second quarter of 2018 increased $45 million year to year, driven primarily by lower expected return on plan assets ($66 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($26 million), partially offset by lower interest costs ($52 million). For the first six months of 2018, operating retirement-related costs were $750 million, an increase of $2 million compared to the first six months of 2017. Non-operating costs of $796 million increased $100 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by lower expected return on plan assets ($114 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($67 million); partially offset by lower interest costs ($93 million). 

Taxes 

The continuing operations effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was 13.5 percent, an increase of 8.9 points compared to the second quarter of 2017. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first six months of 2018 was (4.3) percent, an increase of 1.4 points compared to the first six months of 2017. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the second quarter was 16.0 percent, an increase of 6.7 points compared to the second quarter of 2017. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the first six months of 2018 was 0.2 percent, a decrease of 1.6 points compared to the first six months of 2017. 

The increase in the continuing operations effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a discrete tax benefit in the second quarter of 2017 attributable to foreign audit activity (7.0 points) and a decrease in foreign tax credits (3.7 points). These impacts were partially offset by a more favorable mix of geographic income year to year (1.2 points) and a provisional benefit due to IRS guidance related to U.S. tax reform enactment issued in April 2018 (0.5 points). The higher operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was driven by the same factors, except for the impact of the provisional tax benefit related to U.S. tax reform. 

The change in the continuing operations effective tax rate for the first six months of 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by the year to year impacts above, as well as a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2018 from the resolution of certain tax matters related to the ongoing U.S. federal audit of the companys 2013 and 2014 tax returns and the completion of the U.S. federal audit of amended tax returns of prior years in the first quarter of 2018. These benefits were

partially offset by the prior-year tax benefit related to the intercompany transfer of IP recognized in the first quarter of 2017, and a first-quarter 2018 provisional tax charge due to the January 2018 IRS guidance related to U.S. tax reform enactment. 

The change in the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was primarily driven by the same factors, except for the impact of the provisional net tax charge in the first six months of 2018 related to U.S. tax reform enactment. 

Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. 





Actual shares outstanding at June 30, 2018 were 912.8 million. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution during the second quarter and first six months of 2018 were 20.2 million and 21.3 million shares lower than the same periods of 2017. The decreases were primarily the result of the common stock repurchase program. 

Financial Position 

Dynamics 

At June 30, 2018, the balance sheet remained strong and the company continues to have the financial flexibility to support the business for the long term. Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $11,926 million. The company continues to manage the investment portfolio to meet its capital preservation and liquidity objectives. Total debt of $45,497 million decreased $1,326 million from December 31, 2017, driven by debt maturities of $3,652 million; partially offset by new debt issuances of $2,535 million. Within total debt, $31,056 million, or approximately 68 percent, is in support of the Global Financing business. In the first six months of 2018, the company generated $6,896 million in cash from operations, compared to $7,421 million in the first six months of 2017. The company has consistently generated strong cash flows from operations and continues to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its credit facilities.

The assets and debt associated with the Global Financing business are a significant part of the companys financial position. The financial position amounts appearing on pages 5 and 6 are the consolidated amounts including Global Financing. 







At June 30, 2018, substantially all client and commercial financing assets were IT related assets, and approximately 54 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers. The increase in investment grade year to year (2 points) was driven primarily by rating changes within the existing portfolio, not by changing the companys approach to the market. This investment grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio. 

The company has a long-standing practice of taking mitigating actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties, including credit insurance, financial guarantees, non-recourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease. Adjusting for the mitigation actions, the investment grade content would increase by 15 points to 70 percent, an increase of 2 points year to year.

· A decline in receivables of $3,290 million ($2,797 million adjusted for currency) driven by declines in financing receivables of $1,915 million and trade receivables of $1,483 million; partially offset by 

· An increase of $583 million ($633 million adjusted for currency) in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to the reclassification of certain trade receivables due to the adoption of the new revenue standard.

· A decrease in taxes payable of $1,439 million ($1,369 million adjusted for currency) principally driven by the resolution in the first-quarter 2018 of certain matters related to the ongoing U.S. tax audit of the companys 2013-2014 tax returns; and 

· A decrease in accounts payable of $933 million ($859 million adjusted for currency) reflecting declines from typically higher year-end balances; partially offset by 

· An increase in short-term debt of $659 million ($719 million adjusted for currency) primarily as a result of maturities of $3,601 million; partially offset by reclassifications of $3,774 million from long-term debt to reflect upcoming maturities.

The total IBM receivables provision coverage was 1.8 percent at June 30, 2018, an increase of 20 basis points compared to December 31, 2017. The majority of the write-offs during the six months ended June 30, 2018 related to Global Financing receivables, which had been previously reserved. 

Global Financing Receivables and Allowances 

The following table presents external Global Financing receivables excluding residual values, the allowance for credit losses and immaterial miscellaneous receivables. 



The percentage of Global Financing receivables reserved increased from 1.1 percent at December 31, 2017, to 1.2 percent at June 30, 2018. The increase was driven by the overall decline in gross receivables. Specific reserves decreased 1 percent from $258 million at December 31, 2017, to $255 million at June 30, 2018. Unallocated reserves increased 7 percent from $78 million at December 31, 2017, to $84 million at June 30, 2018.

Global Financings bad debt expense was $20 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $6 million for the same period in 2017 due to higher specific reserve requirements in 2018. 

Global Financings bad debt expense was $24 million for the six months ended June 30, 3018 compared to $16 million for the same period in 2017, primarily as a result of the same factor. 

Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities 



· A decrease of $768 million in long-term financing receivables ($645 million adjusted for currency) reflecting seasonal reductions from higher year-end balances; and 

· A decrease in intangibles and goodwill of $705 million ($365 million adjusted for currency) resulting from intangibles amortization and currency impacts; partially offset by 

· An increase in retirement plan assets of $732 million ($811 million adjusted for currency) driven by the expected returns on plan assets, partially offset by interest costs. 


· Reclassifications to short-term debt of $3,774 million to reflect upcoming maturities; partially offset by 

· Issuances of $2,396 million. 


· A decrease in retirement and nonpension postretirement liabilities of $758 million driven by a currency impact of $308 million. 

Debt 

The companys funding requirements are continually monitored and strategies are executed to manage the overall asset and liability profile. Additionally, the company maintains sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as needed. 


Table of Contents 

Management Discussion  (continued) 


Total debt of $45,497 million decreased $1,326 million from December 31, 2017, driven by debt maturities of $3,652 million; partially offset by new debt issuances of $2,535 million. 


Non-Global Financing debt of $14,441 million was down $949 million from December 31, 2017 and down $2,186 million from June 30, 2017. 

Global Financing debt-to-equity ratio 


The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arms-length pricing. 

Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the companys external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financings external client and internal business is included in the Global Financing Results of Operations on page 70 and in note 7, Segments, on pages 36 and 37. In the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense. 

Equity 

Total equity increased by $923 million from December 31, 2017 primarily due to increases from net income ($4,083 million), an increase in retirement-related amounts ($1,121 million) and transition adjustments related to the adoption of the new revenue standard ($524 million); partially offset by decreases from dividends ($2,819 million) and an increase in treasury stock ($1,859 million) primarily due to share repurchases. 

Cash Flow 

The companys cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 7, are summarized in the following table. These amounts include the cash flows associated with the Global Financing business.

· An increase in cash income tax payments of $710 million; and 

· A decrease in cash provided by financing receivables of $432 million; partially offset by 

· Working capital improvements of $507 million. 


· An increase in net non-operating financing receivables of $394 million; 

· An increase in cash used for net capital expenditures of $329 million; and 

· An increase from net purchases of marketable securities and other investments of $327 million. 


· An increase in net cash used in debt transactions of $3,506 million primarily driven by lower net debt issuances; partially offset by 

· A decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases of $959 million. 

Looking Forward 

The companys strategies, investments and actions are all made with an objective of optimizing long-term performance. A long-term perspective ensures that the company is well-positioned to take advantage of the major shifts in technology, business and the global economy. 

As part of its strategic model, the company expects to continue to allocate capital efficiently and effectively to investments, and to return value to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Over the long term, in consideration of the opportunities it will continue to develop, the company expects to have the ability to generate low single-digit revenue growth, and with a higher-value business mix, mid single-digit profit growth, high single-digit operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share growth, with free cash flow realization of GAAP net income over 90 percent. 

Over the last several years, the company has been making investments and shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into its offerings while building new solutions and modernizing its existing platforms. These investments not only drive current performance, but will extend the companys innovation leadership into the future. The companys key differentiators are built around three pillars - innovative technology, industry expertise and trust and security, uniquely delivered through an integrated model. 

The companys results in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 reflect the work that has been done to reposition the business through investment, shifting skills and reallocating capital. These shifts reflect the companys vision of what clients value in a rapidly re-ordering IT industry, driven by cloud, data and AI. In the second quarter, the company delivered revenue growth, as reported and adjusted for currency, pre-tax income growth (GAAP and operating (non-GAAP)) 


Table of Contents 

Management Discussion  (continued) 

and earnings per share growth. The company expects typical seasonality for the third quarter with respect to sequential revenue performance and year-to-date earnings per share attainment. Since April 2018 expectations, currency markets experienced significant volatility and the company now expects currency to be a 1 point tailwind for full-year 2018 revenue growth, which includes a 1 to 2 point headwind in the second half of the year. Even with this change, the company continues to expect full-year revenue growth at mid-July spot rates, and the companys expectations of pre-tax profit remain unchanged. 

Consistent with the long-term model, the company also expects, over the course of 2018, to continue to acquire key capabilities, remix skills, invest in areas of growth and return value to shareholders. A high level of investment is important as the company continues to build its capabilities in AI, cloud, security and blockchain, among others. The actions taken in the first-quarter 2018 to reposition the business are aligned with this strategy. While there was some benefit in the second quarter, the majority of the benefit from first-quarter workforce rebalancing actions is expected in the second-half 2018. In the second half of 2018, the company will continue to invest in Cloud but will also continue to realize scale efficiencies partially driven by as-a-Service revenue. The company continues to expect expansion of total services margins in the second half. 

Overall, the company expects GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for 2018 to be at least $11.60; excluding acquisition-related charges of $0.78 per share, non-operating retirement-related items of $1.32 per share and U.S. tax reform related one-time charges of $0.10 per share, operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share is expected to be at least $13.80. 

Free cash flow realization, which is defined as free cash flow to income from continuing operations (GAAP), is expected to be over 100%. The company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2018. Free cash flow expectations for the year include a year-to-year headwind from strong receivables performance in 2017, a year-to-year headwind from cash tax payments, which has been fully realized by the end of the second quarter, and a full year expected increase in capital expenditures. 

For 2018, the company expects the GAAP tax rate to be approximately 2 points lower than the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate expectation. The company expects its operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for 2018 to be 16 percent, plus or minus 2 points (excluding discrete items), which is a headwind year to year. The tax rates reflect U.S. tax reform, which includes a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, offset by the broader tax base and reduced foreign tax credit utilization. The rate will change year to year based on discrete tax events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies. The GAAP tax rate could also be affected by any change to the net provisional charge recorded by the company for U.S. tax reform enactment. 

The company expects 2018 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $3.1 billion, an increase of approximately $200 million compared to 2017. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2017. Consistent with the new FASB guidance for the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2017. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, an increase of approximately $200 million compared to 2017, driven by lower income from expected return on assets and a year-to-year impact due to the pension obligation adjustment resulting from the successful resolution of the UK pension litigation matter in 2017. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2018, approximately flat compared to 2017. 

Currency Rate Fluctuations 

Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar (USD) affect the companys financial results and financial position. At June 30, 2018, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars than at year-end 2017. The company uses financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign currency-based transactions. 

During periods of sustained movements in currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, the company may use some of the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve its position competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially passing on a portion of the currency advantage to its customers. Competition will frequently take the same action. Consequently, the company believes that some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to clients. The company also maintains 


Table of Contents 

Management Discussion  (continued) 

currency hedging programs for cash management purposes which temporarily mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on the companys financial results. 

The company translates revenue, cost and expense in its non-U.S. operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to adjusted for currency or constant currency reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula. However, this constant currency methodology that the company utilizes to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted the companys year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in the first six months of 2018. Based on the currency rate movements in the first six months of 2018, total revenue increased 4.4 percent as reported and 0.8 percent at constant currency versus the first six months of 2017. On an income from continuing operations before income tax basis, these translation impacts offset by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) increase of approximately $175 million in the first six months of 2018 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately $200 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The same mathematical exercise resulted in no impact as reported and a decrease of approximately $10 million in the first six months of 2017 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The company views these amounts as a theoretical maximum impact to its as-reported financial results. Considering the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any particular period, but the company believes it could be substantially less than the theoretical maximum given the competitive pressure in the marketplace. 

For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations. Generally, the company manages currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars. 

In the recent months there have been reported economic events impacting the Argentinean economy, such as significant depreciation of the Argentine peso, increases in interest rates and the Argentine government requesting financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund. The three-year cumulative inflation rates, using a combination of monthly indices, exceeds the 100% threshold for hyperinflation. As a result, effective July 1, 2018, the company changed the functional currency from local currency to U.S. dollar functional for Argentina. The impact from the change is not expected to be material given the size of the companys operations in the country (less than 1 percent of total 2017 revenue). 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

In the companys 2017 Annual Report, on pages 67 to 70, there is a discussion of the companys liquidity including two tables that present five years of data. The table presented on page 67 includes net cash from operating activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of the companys global credit facilities for each of the past five years. For the six months ended, or as of, as applicable, June 30, 2018, those amounts are $6.9 billion for net cash from operating activities, $11.9 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $15.3 billion in global credit facilities, respectively. 

The major rating agencies ratings on the companys debt securities at June 30, 2018 appear in the table below. The ratings remain unchanged from December 31, 2017. The company does not have ratings trigger provisions in its debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. The companys contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if the companys credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At June 30, 2018, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $256 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the companys outstanding instruments and market conditions. The company has no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity. 


The company prepares its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 7 of this Form 10-Q and highlights causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 84. For the purpose of running its business, the company manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different manner. 


Table of Contents 

Management Discussion  (continued) 

Management uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows. As previously noted, the company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result the company does not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric. 

The following is managements view of cash flows for the first six months of 2018 and 2017 prepared in a manner consistent with the description above.  



In the first six months of 2018, the company generated free cash flow of $3.2 billion, a decrease of $0.4 billion versus the prior year driven by higher cash taxes and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by working capital performance. Net capital expenditures of $1.9 billion increased $0.3 billion year to year reflecting increased investments to build out global cloud datacenters. In the first six months of 2018, the company continued to focus its cash utilization on returning value to shareholders including $2.8 billion in dividends and $1.8 billion in gross common stock repurchases (11.7 million shares). 

Events that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed previously and in the companys 2017 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation, future pension funding requirements during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more completely described in note 13, Contingencies, in this Form 10-Q. With respect to pension funding, the company expects to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. defined benefit plans of approximately $400 million in 2018. Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2018. Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status. The company is not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations. 

In 2018, the company is not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit plans. 

The companys U.S. cash flows continue to be sufficient to fund its current domestic operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service. The companys U.S. operations generate

substantial cash flows, and, in those circumstances where the company has additional cash requirements in the U.S., the company has several liquidity options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates, utilizing its committed global credit facility, repatriating certain foreign earnings and utilizing intercompany loans with certain foreign subsidiaries.
