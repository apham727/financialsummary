Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements  

For purposes of this Quarterly Report, the terms Oracle, we, us and our refer to Oracle Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that are not historical in nature, are predictive in nature, or that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or otherwise contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include, among other things, statements regarding:  

       our expectations regarding the impacts of the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our tax position and ability to access and use cash and other balances held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries;  

       our expectation that we will continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy;  

       our belief that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value;  

       our expectation that, on a constant currency basis, our total cloud and on-premise software revenues generally will continue to increase due to expected growth from our cloud software as a service (SaaS) and cloud platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offerings, continued demand for our software products and related support offerings, and contributions from acquisitions;  

       our expectation that we will continue to place significant strategic emphasis on growing our cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS offerings, which has affected the growth of our new software license revenues and hardware revenues and to a lesser extent, has also affected the growth of our software license updates and product support revenues;  

       our intention that we will renew our cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS contracts when they are eligible for renewal;  

       our expectation that our hardware business will have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and on-premise software business;  

       our expectation that we will continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities, including those related to hardware products and services, and our belief that research and development efforts are essential to maintaining our competitive position;  

       our expectation that our international operations will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses;  

       the sufficiency of our sources of funding for working capital, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, debt repayments and other matters;  

       our belief that we have adequately provided under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for outcomes related to our tax audits and that the final outcome of our tax related examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations, and our belief that our net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future;  

       our belief that the outcome of certain legal proceedings and claims to which we are a party will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any;  

       the possibility that certain legal proceedings to which we are a party could have a material impact on our future cash flows and results of operations;  

       our expectations regarding the timing and amount of expenses relating to the Fiscal 2017 Oracle Restructuring Plan and the improved efficiencies in our operations that such plan will create;  


Table of Contents 

       the timing and amount of our stock repurchases, including our expectation that the levels of our future stock repurchase activity may be modified in comparison to past periods in order to use available cash for other purposes;  

       our expectations regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements;  

       our expectation that to the extent customers renew support contracts or cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS contracts from companies that we have acquired, we will recognize revenues for the full contracts values over the respective renewal periods;  

       our ability to predict quarterly hardware revenues;  

as well as other statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, and business strategies. Forward-looking statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, strives, estimates, will, should, is designed to and similar expressions. We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for all forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about our business that could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Risk Factors included in documents we file from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2017 and our other Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed by us in our fiscal year 2018, which runs from June 1, 2017 to May 31, 2018.  

We have no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or risks, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. New information, future events or risks could cause the forward-looking events we discuss in this Quarterly Report not to occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect our expectations only as of the date of this Quarterly Report.

 1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

Basis of Presentation  

We have prepared the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. However, we believe that the disclosures herein are adequate to ensure the information presented is not misleading. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017.  

We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring items, have been included in the accompanying financial statements to present fairly the results of the interim periods. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for any subsequent interim period or for our fiscal year ending May 31, 2018. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, operating income or net income (loss).  


Impacts of the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  

The comparability of our operating results in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year periods, and of our consolidated balance sheets as of February 28, 2018 relative to May 31, 2017, was impacted by the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Effective January 1, 2018, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; creates a quasi-territorial tax system that a) generally allows, among other provisions, companies to repatriate certain foreign source earnings without incurring additional U.S. income tax for such earnings generated after December 31, 2017 and b) generally requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings generated prior to December 31, 2017 that, in substantial part, were previously tax deferred; creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings; limits deductibility of certain future compensation arrangements to certain highly compensated employees; and provides tax incentives for the exportation of U.S. products to foreign jurisdictions and for the purchase of qualifying capital equipment, among other provisions.  

Because we have a May 31 fiscal year end, our fiscal 2018 blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate will be approximately 29%.  


       a $7.6 billion expense related to the application of the one-time transition tax to certain foreign subsidiary earnings that were generated prior to December 31, 2017, which expense was substantially recorded to non-current income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet and which corresponds to the amount we currently expect to periodically settle over an eight year period as provided by the Act;  

partially offset by:  

       a $744 million benefit related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future; and  


Table of Contents 

ORACLE CORPORATION  

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  



       the net favorable impacts of the Act on our tax profile and effective tax rate beginning on January 1, 2018, which we generally expect will continue into future periods.  

The net expense related to the enactment of the Act has been accounted for during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 based on provisional estimates pursuant to the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. Subsequent adjustments, if any, will be accounted for in the period such adjustments are identified. The provisional estimates incorporate, among other factors, assumptions made based on interpretations of the Act and existing tax laws, and a range of historical and forecasted financial and tax-specific facts and information, including, without limitation, the amount of cash and other specified assets anticipated to be held by the Companys foreign subsidiaries on relevant dates and estimates of deferred tax balances during interim periods pending finalization of those balances.  

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash  

Restricted cash that was included within cash and cash equivalents as presented within our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of February 28, 2018 and May 31, 2017 and our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 was nominal.  

Acquisition Related and Other Expenses  

Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs and stock-based compensation for transitional and certain other employees, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net.  


Non-Operating Income, net  

Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Japan) and net other income, including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments and net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading.

Sales of Financing Receivables  

We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. Financing receivables sold to financial institutions were $360 million and $1.3 billion for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, and $296 million and $1.3 billion for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2017, respectively.

Fiscal 2018 Proposed Acquisitions  

During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we entered into certain non-material agreements to acquire certain companies and expect these proposed acquisitions to close during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.  

Fiscal 2017 Acquisition of NetSuite Inc., a Related Party  

On November 7, 2016, we completed our acquisition of NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite), a provider of cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and related applications and a related party to Oracle. We acquired NetSuite to, among other things, expand our cloud software as a service offerings with a complementary set of cloud ERP and related cloud software applications for customers.  

Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracles Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer and Oracles largest stockholder, is an affiliate of NetSuites largest stockholder, NetSuite Restricted Holdings LLC (a single member

ORACLE CORPORATION  

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  



 LLC investment entity whose interests are beneficially owned by a trust controlled by Mr. Ellison), which owned approximately 40% of the issued and outstanding NetSuite Shares immediately prior to the conclusion of the merger.  

The total purchase price for NetSuite was approximately $9.1 billion, which consisted of approximately $9.0 billion in cash and $78 million for the fair values of restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed. In allocating the purchase price based on estimated fair values, we recorded approximately $6.7 billion of goodwill, $3.2 billion of identifiable intangible assets and $763 million of net tangible liabilities. Goodwill generated from our acquisition of NetSuite was primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017 for additional information regarding our acquisition of NetSuite.  

Other Fiscal 2017 Acquisitions  

During fiscal 2017, we acquired certain companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our cloud-based offerings. These acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate. We have included the financial results of the acquired companies in our condensed consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates, and the results from each of these companies were not individually material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. The total of the purchase prices, certain of which were preliminary, for these acquisitions was approximately $3.0 billion, which consisted of approximately $3.0 billion in cash and $13 million for the fair values of restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed. As of February 28, 2018, we recorded $243 million of net tangible assets and $948 million of identifiable intangible assets, based on their estimated fair values, and $1.8 billion of residual goodwill related to our fiscal 2017 acquisitions. Certain amounts included in these totals were preliminary and subject to change during the respective measurement periods (up to one year from the respective acquisition dates) as we obtain additional information for the preliminary fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The primary areas of those preliminary estimates that are not yet finalized related to certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, identifiable intangible assets, certain legal matters, income and non-income based taxes and residual goodwill.  

Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information  

The unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for Oracle, NetSuite and certain other companies that we acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2017 that were considered relevant for the purposes of unaudited pro forma financial information disclosure as if the companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2017. The unaudited pro forma financial information for all periods presented included the business combination accounting effects resulting from these acquisitions, including amortization charges from acquired intangible assets (certain of which are preliminary), stock-based compensation charges for unvested restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed, if any, and the related tax effects as though the aforementioned companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2017. The unaudited pro forma financial information as presented below is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2017.  

The unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018 presented the historical results of Oracle for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018 as we did not complete any material acquisitions during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.  

The unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2017 combined the historical results of Oracle for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2017, the historical results of NetSuite for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 (adjusted due to differences in reporting periods and considering the date we acquired NetSuite) and the historical results of certain other companies that

 3.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

We perform fair value measurements in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurement. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  




Based on the trading prices of the $60.9 billion and $54.0 billion of senior notes and the related fair value hedges that were outstanding as of February 28, 2018 and May 31, 2017, respectively, the estimated fair values of the senior notes and the related fair value hedges using Level 2 inputs at February 28, 2018 and May 31, 2017 were $62.0 billion and $56.5 billion, respectively.

 5.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL  







 (1)   Pursuant to our business combinations accounting policy, we recorded goodwill adjustments for the effects on goodwill of changes to net assets acquired during the period that such a change is identified, provided that any such change is within the measurement period (up to one year from the date of the acquisition).

 6.  NOTES PAYABLE AND OTHER BORROWINGS  

Senior Notes  



We issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment of indebtedness and future acquisitions. The interest is payable semi-annually. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances.  

The senior notes rank pari passu with any other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Oracle Corporation. All existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of the subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation are or will be effectively senior to the senior notes. We were in compliance with all debt-related covenants at February 28, 2018.  

There have been no other significant changes in our notes payable or other borrowing arrangements that were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017.  


Fiscal 2017 Oracle Restructuring Plan  

During fiscal 2017, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our recent acquisitions and certain other operational activities (2017 Restructuring Plan). In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, our management supplemented the 2017 Restructuring Plan to reflect additional actions that we expect to take. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2017 Restructuring Plan are up to $1.1 billion and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our condensed consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. We recorded $516 million of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2017 Restructuring Plan in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and we expect to incur the majority of the estimated remaining $112 million through the end of fiscal 2018. Any changes to the estimates of executing the 2017 Restructuring Plan will be reflected in our future results of operations.  


Table of Contents 

ORACLE CORPORATION  

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  



Summary of All Plans  


 (1)   Restructuring costs recorded for individual line items primarily related to employee severance costs.  

 (2)   The balances at February 28, 2018 and May 31, 2017 included $298 million and $242 million, respectively, recorded in other current liabilities, and $33 million and $22 million, respectively, recorded in other non-current liabilities.  

 (3)   Costs recorded for the respective restructuring plans during the current period presented.  

 (4)   All plan adjustments were changes in estimates whereby increases and decreases in costs were generally recorded to operating expenses in the period of adjustments.  

 (5)   Represents foreign currency translation and certain other adjustments.  

 (6)   Other restructuring plans presented in the table above included condensed information for other Oracle based plans and other plans associated with certain of our acquisitions whereby we continued to make cash outlays to settle obligations under these plans during the period presented but for which the periodic impact to our condensed consolidated statements of operations was not significant.  




Deferred software license updates and product support revenues and deferred hardware revenues substantially represent customer payments made in advance for support contracts that are typically billed on a per annum basis in advance with corresponding revenues being recognized ratably over the support periods. Deferred cloud software as a service (SaaS) and deferred cloud platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) revenues generally resulted from customer payments made in advance for our cloud-based offerings that are recognized over the corresponding contractual term. Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed.  


Table of Contents 

ORACLE CORPORATION  

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  



 Deferred new software licenses revenues typically resulted from customer payments that relate to undelivered products or specified enhancements, customer specific acceptance provisions, time-based license arrangements and software license transactions that cannot be separated from undelivered consulting or other services.  

In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS, cloud PaaS and IaaS and software license updates and product support obligations, among others, assumed from our acquired companies. We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumed using a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations. These aforementioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud SaaS, cloud PaaS and IaaS, software license updates and product support, and hardware deferred revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over the terms of the acquired obligations during the post-combination periods.  

 9.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  


       interest rate swap agreements, which are used to protect us against changes in the fair values of certain of our fixed-rate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate movements and are accounted for as fair value hedges;  

       cross-currency swap agreements, which are used to manage foreign currency exchange risk by converting certain of our fixed-rate Euro-denominated borrowings to fixed-rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and are accounted for as cash flow hedges; and  

       foreign currency borrowings, which are used to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar and are accounted for as net investment hedges.  

We also held certain foreign currency contracts that were not designated as hedges pursuant to ASC 815. As of February 28, 2018 and May 31, 2017, the notional amounts of such forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $4.5 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, and the notional amount of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal as of February 28, 2018 and May 31, 2017. The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activities. Net gains or losses related to these forward contracts are included in non-operating income, net.

Effects of Derivative and Non-Derivative Instruments Designated as Hedges on Income and Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) or Loss (OCL)  




Common Stock Repurchases  

Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $24.0 billion. As of February 28, 2018, approximately $22.8 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 131.6 million shares for $6.5 billion during the nine months ended February 28, 2018 (including 2.1 million shares for $105 million that were repurchased but not settled) and 74.6 million shares for $3.0 billion during the nine months ended February 28, 2017 under the stock repurchase program.  


Table of Contents 

ORACLE CORPORATION  

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  



Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.  

Dividends on Common Stock  

During the nine months ended February 28, 2018, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.57 per share of our outstanding common stock, which we paid during the same period.  

In March 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on May 1, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 17, 2018. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.  

Fiscal 2018 Stock-Based Awards Activity, Valuation and Compensation Expense  

During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we issued 41 million restricted stock-based awards and 77 million stock options (consisting of 8 million service-based stock options (SOs) and 69 million performance-based and market-based stock options (PSOs)). Substantially all of the awards were issued as a part of our annual stock-based award process and are subject to service-based vesting restrictions, with the PSOs primarily having performance-based and market-based vesting restrictions. Our fiscal 2018 stock-based awards issuances were partially offset by forfeitures and cancellations of 16 million shares during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.  

The RSUs and SOs that were granted during the nine months ended February 28, 2018 have vesting restrictions, valuations and contractual lives of a similar nature to those described in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017.

ORACLE CORPORATION  

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  






Our effective tax rates for each of the periods presented are the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018 the Act was signed into law. The more significant provisions of the Act as applicable to us are described in Note 1 above under Impacts of the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal 2018 periods presented varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Act due primarily to the January 1, 2018 effective date of the Act, the impacts of the Act upon adoption, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Prior to the January 1, 2018 effective date of the Act, our provision for income taxes historically differed from the tax computed at the previous U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Our effective tax rates were 222.0% and 95.2% for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, and 17.0% and 21.3% for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2017, respectively. 

Our net deferred tax assets were $1.6 billion and $683 million as of February 28, 2018 and May 31, 2017, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change.  

Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2016. Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007, and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2004, and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods.  

Internationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1997.

On July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. A final decision has yet to be issued by the Tax Court due to other outstanding issues related to the case. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations. We have reviewed this case and its impact on Oracle and concluded that no adjustment to the consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time. We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements.  

We are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, India, Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom, where the amounts under controversy are significant. In some, although not all, cases, we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it could result in a further charge to expense.  

We believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits. However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof.  


ASC 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision makers (CODMs) are our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer. We are organized by line of business and geographically. While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. In recent periods, customer demand has increased at a greater rate for cloud-based IT deployment models relative to on-premise IT deployment models. Our CODMs view the operating results of our three businesses and allocate resources in a manner that is consistent with the changing market dynamics that we have experienced. As a result, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we updated our operating segments. The footnote information below presents the financial information provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the companys performance and allocating company resources.  

We have three businessescloud and on-premise software, hardware and serviceseach of which is comprised of a single operating segment.  

Our cloud and on-premise software line of business markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through our cloud offerings and software offerings. Our Oracle Cloud SaaS and Cloud PaaS and IaaS offerings deliver certain of our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we host, manage and support. Our IaaS offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and security services for on-premise, cloud-based or hybrid IT infrastructures. Our cloud and on-premise software business also licenses our software products, generally on a perpetual basis, including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among

 others, for cloud and other IT environments. Customers that license our software have the option to purchase software license updates and product support contracts, which provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases, patch releases, internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel during the support period.  

Our hardware business provides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems including the Oracle Solaris operating system and management software to support diverse IT environments. Our hardware business also includes hardware support, which provides customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.  

Our services business provides services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies.  

We do not track our assets for each business. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment.  




 (2)   The margins reported reflect only the direct controllable costs of each line of business and do not include allocations of product development, general and administrative and certain other allocable expenses, net. Additionally, the margins reported above do not reflect amortization of intangible assets, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, stock-based compensation, interest expense or certain other non-operating income, net.

Hewlett-Packard Company Litigation  

On June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company, now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HP), filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action including breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, defamation, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The complaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HPs Itanium-based servers, it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20, 2010 between HP and Mark Hurd (the Hurd Settlement Agreement), who is our Chief Executive Officer and was both HPs former chief executive officer and chairman of HPs board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties rights and obligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief.  

Oracle answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint, which was amended on December 2, 2011. The amended cross-complaint alleged claims including violation of the Lanham Act. Oracle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor, and had misrepresented to customers that the Itanium microprocessor had a long roadmap, among other claims. Oracle sought equitable rescission of the Hurd Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief.  

The court bifurcated the trial and tried HPs causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012. The court issued a final statement of decision on August 28, 2012, finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HPs Itanium-based servers and to port such products at no cost to HP for as long as HP sells those servers (the Phase One Ruling). A jury trial began on May 23, 2016. On June 30, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and against Oracle on its claim for violation of the Lanham Act (the Phase Two Jury Verdict). The jury awarded HP damages in the amount of $3.0 billion, and HP is entitled to post-judgment interest on this award. On August 30, 2016, the court denied HPs motion for pre-judgment interest. Judgment was entered on October 20, 2016. Oracle posted certain court-mandated surety bonds with the court in order to proceed with its motion for a new trial and entered into related indemnification agreements with each of the surety bond issuing companies. Oracle filed a motion for a new trial on November 14, 2016, which was denied.

Derivative Litigation  

On May 3, 2017, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The derivative suit is brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracles behalf, against Oracle, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Technology Officer in his capacities as a director, officer and an alleged controlling stockholder, one of our Chief Executive Officers (who is also a director), three other directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) at an excessive price. Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, an order rescinding or reforming the NetSuite transaction, unspecified monetary damages (including interest), attorneys fees and costs, and disgorgement of various unspecified profits, fees, compensation, and benefits. On July 19, 2017, defendants moved to dismiss this complaint.  

On July 18, 2017, a second stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, brought by another alleged stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracles behalf. The suit is brought against all current members and one former member of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite at an excessive price. Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, unspecified monetary damages (including interest), and attorneys fees and costs.  

On August 9, 2017, the court consolidated the two derivative cases, and vacated the scheduling order relating to defendants motion to dismiss the first case. In a September 7, 2017 order, the court appointed plaintiffs counsel in the second case as lead plaintiffs counsel and designated the July 18, 2017 complaint as the operative complaint. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on October 27, 2017, and the plaintiffs filed an opposition on December 15, 2017. The defendants filed their reply on January 9, 2018, and the court heard oral argument on January 25, 2018. On March 19, 2018, the court denied this motion. The court ordered supplemental briefing on the issue whether all of the defendants, except for our Chief Technology Officer and one of our Chief Executive Officers, should be dismissed from this case.  

While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.  

Other Litigation  

We are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any.

 Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

We begin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.  

Business Overview  

Oracle Corporation provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology (IT) environmentsapplications, platform and infrastructure. Our applications, platform and infrastructure offerings are delivered to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models including cloud based, on-premise or hybrid, which enable customer choice and flexibility. We market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.  


Our comprehensive and fully integrated stack of Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings integrate the software, hardware and services on the customers behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage for the customer. Our integrated Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between cloud and on-premise IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between on-premise IT environments and the Oracle Cloud; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and to be secure, standards-based and reliable. We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud IT environments, including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure. Our products and services are the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services, our partners cloud services and our customers cloud IT environments.  

In addition to providing a broad spectrum of cloud offerings, we develop and sell our applications, platform and infrastructure products and services to our customers worldwide for use in cloud-based IT environments and other IT environments. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue our investments in, and innovation with respect to, our products and services that we offer through our cloud and on-premise software, hardware and services businesses. We have a deep understanding as to how applications, platform and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another within IT environments. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more cost-effective and easier to deploy, manage and maintain for our customers and to improve their computing performance relative to our competitors. After the initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to benefit from our research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings for their software and hardware deployments, which may include unspecified product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and by renewing their cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts with us.  

As customers deploy with the Oracle Cloud, many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT instances are deployed using the Oracle Cloud, while other of their IT instances are deployed using Oracle on-premise offerings, with both instances designed with capabilities to be managed as though they are a single instance. Our Oracle Cloud at Customer program provides another deployment option for customers to utilize the Oracle Cloud Machine and Oracle Database Exadata Cloud Machine to bring certain Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings to a customers on-premise IT environment to meet data sovereignty, data residency, data protection and regulatory business policy requirements, among others, while benefiting from the many advantages of a cloud service.  


Table of Contents 

A selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy.  

In recent periods, customer demand has increased at a greater rate for cloud-based IT deployment models relative to on-premise IT deployment models. To address this demand, we have increased our investments in and focus on the development, marketing and sale of our cloud-based applications, platform and infrastructure technologies resulting in higher growth of our cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues as customer preferences have pivoted to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and as customers migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing on-premise workloads. We expect these trends to continue. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better address customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer offerings and more restrictive deployment models. We enable our customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT deployment model at whatever pace is most appropriate for them.  


Cloud and On-Premise Software Business  

Our cloud and on-premise software line of business, which represented 81% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and on-premise software offerings.  

Our Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings deliver applications, platform and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that we host, manage and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Our IaaS offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and security services for on-premise, cloud-based, or hybrid IT infrastructure for a stated period. The majority of our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS arrangements have a duration of 12 to 36 months and we strive to renew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal.  

We offer customers the ability to license our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among others, for cloud-based and other IT environments. Our new software license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized when unrestricted access to the software license is granted provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. The timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software licenses revenues, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud-based offerings in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the subscription period. New software license customers have the option to purchase software license updates and product support contracts, which grant rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period, as well as technical support assistance. Our software license updates and product support contracts are generally one year in duration and are generally billed in advance of the service being performed and are generally recognized as revenues as the software support services are delivered.  


Table of Contents 

Our cloud SaaS, cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues and new software licenses revenues are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions, governmental budgetary constraints, the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings, our acquisitions, our ability to deliver and renew our cloud contracts with our existing customers and foreign currency rate fluctuations. In recent periods, we have placed significant strategic emphasis on growing our cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues, which represented 16% of our total consolidated revenues during each of the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, and 13% and 12% of our total consolidated revenues during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively. This emphasis has affected the growth of our new software licenses revenues and, to a lesser extent, has also affected the growth of our software license updates and product support revenues. We expect these trends will continue with the mix of this business revenues continuing to shift toward cloud-based services.  



       expected growth in our cloud SaaS offerings and our cloud PaaS and IaaS offerings;  

       continued demand for our software products and related software support, including the high percentage of customers that purchase and renew their software license updates and product support contracts; and  

       contributions from our acquisitions.  

We believe all of these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and on-premise software revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development to develop and improve our cloud and on-premise software products and services.  

Our cloud and on-premise software business margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term.  

Hardware Business  

Our hardware business, which represented 10% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, provides a broad selection of hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems, and management software that are generally recognized as revenues upon delivery to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met, and also include related hardware support. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues as the hardware support services are delivered.  


Table of Contents 

We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and on-premise software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs.  


Services Business  

Our services business helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, and broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services, advanced support services and education services and represented 9% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and on-premise software and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are impacted by our strategy for and the competitive position of our services; customer demand for our cloud and on-premise software and hardware offerings and the associated services for these offerings; our strategic emphasis on growing our cloud revenues; certain of our acquisitions; general economic conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers IT departments; and tighter controls over discretionary spending.  

Acquisitions  

Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies, including NetSuite Inc. in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions. We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  


       Revenue Recognition;  


Table of Contents 

       Business Combinations;  

       Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments;  

       Accounting for Income Taxes; and  

       Legal and Other Contingencies.  

In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  

During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2017 provides a more complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.  

Results of Operations  

Impacts of the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  

The comparability of our operating results in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year periods was impacted by the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Effective January 1, 2018, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; creates a quasi-territorial tax system that a) generally allows, among other provisions, companies to repatriate certain foreign source earnings without incurring additional U.S. income tax for such earnings generated after December 31, 2017 and b) generally requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings generated prior to December 31, 2017 that, in substantial part, were previously tax deferred; creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings; limits deductibility of certain future compensation arrangements to certain highly compensated employees; and provides tax incentives for the exportation of U.S. products to foreign jurisdictions and for the purchase of qualifying capital equipment; among other provisions.  

Because we have a May 31 fiscal year end, our fiscal 2018 blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate will be approximately 29%.  


       a $7.6 billion expense related to the application of the one-time transition tax to certain foreign subsidiary earnings that were generated prior to December 31, 2017, which expense was substantially recorded to non-current income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet and which corresponds to the amount we currently expect to periodically settle over an eight year period as provided by the Act;  

partially offset by:  

       a $744 million benefit related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future; and  

       the net favorable impacts of the Act on our tax profile and effective tax rate beginning on January 1, 2018, which we generally expect will continue into future periods.  

We expect the enactment of the Act to generally provide greater flexibility for us to access and utilize our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries as of January 1, 2018, as well as for prospective assets generated by these foreign subsidiaries future earnings and profits. We believe we have sufficient cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances, as well as access to other capital resources, if required, to settle the $7.6 billion one-time transition tax described above.  


Table of Contents 

The net expense related to the enactment of the Act has been accounted for during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 based on provisional estimates pursuant to the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. Subsequent adjustments, if any, will be accounted for in the period such adjustments are identified. The provisional estimates incorporate, among other factors, assumptions made based on interpretations of the Act and existing tax laws, and a range of historical and forecasted financial and tax-specific facts and information, including, without limitation, the amount of cash and other specified assets anticipated to be held by the Companys foreign subsidiaries on relevant dates and estimates of deferred tax balances during interim periods pending finalization of those balances.  

Impacts of Acquisitions  



       any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies, including our sales force integration efforts. We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated, the relative mix of products and services sold would have been different; and  

       although substantially all of our software license customers, including customers from acquired companies, renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal, and we strive to renew cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS contracts and hardware support contracts, the amounts shown as cloud and on-premise software deferred revenues and hardware deferred revenues in our Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges (presented below) are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew.  

Seasonality  

Our quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans, which are common in the technology industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. The operating margins of our businesses, in particular, our cloud and on-premise software business and hardware business, are generally affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term.  

Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information  

In our results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our condensed consolidated statement of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses.  


Table of Contents 

In addition, we discuss below the results of each our three businessescloud and on-premise software, hardware and serviceswhich are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each business in the discussion below.  

Consistent with our internal management reporting processes, the below operating segment presentation includes revenues adjustments related to cloud and on-premise software contracts and hardware support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements. Refer to Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges below for additional discussion of these items and Note 12 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for a reconciliation of the summations of our total operating segment revenues as presented in the discussion below to total revenues as presented per our condensed consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.  


Constant Currency Presentation  

Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses revenues and expenses. As a result, each businesses revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Quarterly Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2017, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on February 28, 2018 and 2017, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.23 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 (using 1.23 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.06 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 (using 1.06 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the results for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 using the May 31, 2017 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency.

Total Revenues and Operating Expenses  


 (1)   Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa  

 (2)   The Asia Pacific region includes Japan  


Excluding the effects of unfavorable foreign currency rate variations of 3 percentage points, our total operating expenses decreased during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower hardware products costs and a related decrease in sales and marketing costs, both of which aligned to lower hardware revenues; lower software license updates and product support expenses related primarily to a reduction in certain jurisdictional specific statutory obligation expenses; lower research and development expenses primarily related to lower employee expenses; and a decrease in restructuring expenses. These constant currency expense decreases were partially offset by higher expenses during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 related to higher cloud SaaS expenses and cloud PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increases in our cloud SaaS revenues and cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues; and higher general and administrative expenses that were primarily related to higher professional fees that were legal related.  


Table of Contents 

In constant currency, our total operating margin and operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as our total revenues grew while our total expenses declined.  


Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate variations, our total operating expenses increased during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS expenses due to similar reasons as noted above; higher sales and marketing expenses; increased stockbased compensation expenses; increased restructuring expenses; and higher intangible asset amortization due to additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired in connection with our acquisition of NetSuite and other recently acquired companies. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by constant currency expense decreases during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 related to lower constant currency hardware expenses and lower constant currency software license updates and product support expenses, primarily due to similar reasons as noted above.  

In constant currency, our total operating margin increased during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 due to the increase in our total revenues and operating margin as a percentage of total revenues remained flat.  

Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges  

To supplement our condensed consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. You should review the introduction under Impact of Acquisitions (above) for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre- and post-acquisition information.  



 (1)   In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS subscription and hardware obligations assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize the cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS, and hardware revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers for which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts values over the respective contracts renewal periods.  

 (2)   Certain acquired companies capitalized sales commissions associated with subscription agreements and amortized these amounts over the related contractual terms. Business combination accounting rules generally require us to eliminate these acquired capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date and our post-combination GAAP sales and marketing expenses generally do not reflect the amortization of these acquired deferred sales commissions balances. This adjustment is intended to include, and thus reflect, the full amount of amortization related to such balances as though the acquired companies operated independently in the periods presented.  


Table of Contents 



 (4)   Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs and stock-based compensation expenses for transitional and certain other employees, integration related professional services, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net.  

 (5)   Restructuring expenses during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2017 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2017 Restructuring Plan). Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in the discussion below under Restructuring Expenses, Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, and in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017.  



    Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated generally upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards.  

 (7)   For the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before provision for income taxes after adjusting for the effects of items within the table above, excluding income tax reform (see footnote (8) below), resulted in effective tax rates of 16.1% and 21.9%, respectively, instead of 222.0% and 95.2%, respectively, which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our condensed consolidated statements of operations, primarily due to the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense and acquisition related items, including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets. The income tax effects presented for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017 were calculated reflecting effective tax rates of 21.6% and 24.1%, respectively, instead of 17.0% and 21.3%, respectively, which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our condensed consolidated statements of operations, primarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items, including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets, and the net tax effects of stock-based compensation.  

 (8)   The income tax reform adjustments for the fiscal 2018 periods presented in the table above were due to the our enactment of the Act (refer to Impacts of the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act above for additional discussion), which increased our GAAP provision for income taxes during these fiscal 2018 periods.  

Cloud and On-Premise Software Business  

Our cloud and on-premise software business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS offerings and the licensing of our software for cloud-based and other IT environments with the option to purchase software license updates and product support contracts. Our cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS  


Table of Contents 

 and IaaS offerings are generally subscription based and generally recognized as revenues over the subscription period. New software licenses revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and other IT environments and are generally recognized when unrestricted access to the software license is granted provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Software license updates and product support revenues are typically generated through the sale of software support contracts related to new software licenses purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and on-premise software business are included in cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses, software license updates and product support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS offerings and software support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and software offerings, and marketing program costs.  


 (1)   Includes cloud and on-premise software revenue adjustments related to certain cloud and software support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our GAAP-based consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements. Such revenue adjustments were included in our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs. See Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information above for additional information.  

 (2)   Excludes stock-based compensation and certain allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information above.  

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total revenues from our cloud and on-premise software business increased in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, relative to the corresponding prior  


Table of Contents 

 year periods, due to growth in our cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues, growth in our software license updates and product support revenues and revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions. The increases in our constant currency cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues during the fiscal 2018 periods presented were primarily due to the continued strategic emphasis we placed on selling, marketing and growing our cloud offerings and we expect these revenue trends will continue. The increases in constant currency software license updates and product support revenues during the fiscal 2018 periods presented were a result of substantially all customers electing to purchase software support contracts in conjunction with their purchase of new software licenses, and due to the renewal of substantially all of the software support customer base eligible for renewal during the trailing 4-quarter period. The Americas region contributed 48% and 68%, respectively, the EMEA region contributed 28% and 21%, respectively, and the Asia Pacific region contributed 24% and 11%, respectively, of the constant currency revenues growth for this business during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively.  

In constant currency, total cloud and on-premise software expenses increased in the fiscal 2018 periods presented relative to the corresponding prior year periods primarily due to higher cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and technology infrastructure expenses that were incurred to support the related cloud SaaS and cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues increases; and higher sales and marketing expenses primarily resulting from increased headcount. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by a decrease in software license updates and product support expenses during the fiscal 2018 periods presented, which were primarily related to a reduction in certain jurisdictional specific statutory obligation expenses.  

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and on-premise software segments total margin increased during the fiscal 2018 periods presented relative to the corresponding prior year periods primarily due to the increases in revenues during the fiscal 2018 periods presented. In constant currency, total margin as a percentage of revenues increased in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenues, and was flat in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.

Hardware Business  

Our hardware business revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer server, storage, and industry-specific hardware products for IT environments that are generally recognized as revenues upon delivery to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings. 


 (1)   Includes hardware revenue adjustments related to certain hardware contracts that would have otherwise been recorded as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our GAAP-based consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements. Such revenue adjustments were included in our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs. See Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information above for additional information.  

 (2)   Excludes stock-based compensation and certain allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under Presentation of Operating Segments and Other Financial Information above.  

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware revenues decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, relative to the corresponding prior year periods, due to our continued emphasis on the development, marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of customers that purchased hardware support contracts during the fiscal 2018 periods.  

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses decreased in the fiscal 2018 periods presented, relative to the fiscal 2017 periods presented, due primarily to lower hardware products costs and lower employee related expenses, which aligned to lower hardware revenues.  


Table of Contents 

In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues for our hardware segment increased during the fiscal 2018 periods presented, relative to the corresponding prior year periods, as expenses decreased at a rate faster than our revenues for this business.  

Services Business  

We offer services to customers and partners to help to maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies. Services revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses.  


 (1)   Excludes stock-based compensation and certain allocations. Also excludes certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under Presentation of Operating Segments and Other Financial Information above.  


Total services expenses were flat in constant currency in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 relative to the corresponding prior year period. In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues decreased during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to the decrease in revenues for this business.  


In constant currency, total services expenses were flat during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, while total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues declined slightly.

 (1)   Excluding stock-based compensation  

On a constant currency basis, total research and development expenses decreased during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, each relative to the corresponding prior year periods, primarily due to lower fiscal 2018 employee related expenses related to lower headcount resulting from the restructuring of certain of our research and development operations during the fiscal 2018 periods presented. These fiscal 2018 cost savings were partially offset by investments in the development of our cloud-based offerings and by higher stock-based compensation during the fiscal 2018 periods relative to the corresponding prior year periods.  



 (1)   Excluding stock-based compensation  

On a constant currency basis, total general and administrative expenses increased during the fiscal 2018 periods presented relative to the corresponding prior year periods due primarily to higher professional services expenses that were primarily legal related, and higher stock-based compensation.  





Table of Contents 

 intangible assets that became fully amortized during the trailing four quarter period. These decreases during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were partially offset by additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired since the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2017.  




On a constant currency basis, acquisition related and other expenses decreased in the fiscal 2018 periods presented, relative to the corresponding prior year periods, primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expenses and were also offset by certain benefits we recorded to professional fees and other, net during the fiscal 2018 periods presented.  



Restructuring expenses in the fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 periods presented primarily related to our 2017 Restructuring Plan. Our management approved, committed to and initiated the 2017 Restructuring Plan in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, our management supplemented the 2017 Restructuring Plan to reflect additional actions that we expect to take. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2017 Restructuring Plan are up to $1.1 billion and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our condensed consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. The total estimated remaining restructuring costs associated with the 2017 Restructuring Plan were approximately $112 million as of February 28, 2018 and the majority of the remaining costs are expected to be incurred through the end of fiscal 2018. Our estimated costs are subject to change in future periods.  

The majority of the initiatives undertaken by our 2017 Restructuring Plan were effected to implement our continued move toward developing, marketing and selling our cloud-based offerings. These initiatives impacted  


Table of Contents 

 certain of our sales and marketing and research and development operations. Cost savings that are expected to be realized pursuant to our 2017 Restructuring Plan initiatives are primarily expected to be offset by investments in resources and geographies that best address the development, marketing and sale of our cloud-based offerings as customer preferences pivot to the Oracle Cloud.  



Interest expense increased in the fiscal 2018 periods presented relative to the corresponding prior year periods, primarily due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $10.0 billion of senior notes in November 2017 (refer to Recent Financing Activities presented below for additional information), which was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting from the maturity and repayment of $3.5 billion of senior notes during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.  



On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net increased during the fiscal 2018 periods presented, relative to the fiscal 2017 periods presented, primarily due to an increase in other income, net related to higher net realized gains on the sale of certain marketable securities and higher interest income resulting from higher cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances and higher interest rates.  




Provision for income taxes increased in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, relative to the corresponding prior year periods, primarily due to the net unfavorable impacts due to our initial accounting for the enactment of the Act on January 1, 2018 (refer to Impacts of the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act above for additional information) and, to a lesser extent, by the tax effect of higher income before provision for income taxes (determined after taking into account the net favorable impact of the Act on our tax profile) during the fiscal 2018 periods presented; and changes in unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements with tax authorities and other events during fiscal 2017 not present in fiscal 2018. These unfavorable impacts to our provision for income taxes were partially offset by higher fiscal 2018 realized excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  




As a result of the enactment of the Act on January 1, 2018, we expect greater flexibility in accessing and utilizing our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, as well as prospective assets generated by these foreign subsidiaries future earnings and profits. We believe we have sufficient cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and access to additional capital resources, if required, to settle the $7.6 billion one-time transition tax described under Impacts of the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act above.  

The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally weakened against certain major international currencies during the first nine months of  


Table of Contents 

 fiscal 2018, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries increased on a net basis as of February 28, 2018 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from the May 31, 2017 balance sheet date.  

Days sales outstanding, which we calculate by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter, was 36 days at February 28, 2018 compared with 44 days at May 31, 2017. The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the impact of any revenue adjustments resulting from business combinations that reduced our acquired cloud, on-premise software and hardware obligations to fair value.  



Net cash provided by operating activities increased during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for the one-time income tax accounting effects of our adoption of the Act (refer to Impacts of the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for additional discussion).  


Net cash used for investing activities decreased in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 relative to the first nine months of fiscal 2017 due primarily to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by an increase in cash used to purchase marketable securities and other investments, net of proceeds received from sales and maturities.  


Net cash used for financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $4.5 billion in comparison to net cash provided by financing activities of $5.8 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. The decrease in financing activities cash flows during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 relative to the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to debt related cash flows for which we had $2.6 billion of cash inflows from borrowings, net of repayments, in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 in comparison to $9.8 billion of cash inflows form borrowings, net of repayments, in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 and an increase in repurchases of common stock during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.

       $2.25 billion of 4.00% senior notes due November 2047.  

We issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment of indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additionally, during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we repaid $3.5 billion of senior notes pursuant to their terms. Additional details regarding the senior notes are included in Note 6 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017. There have been no other significant changes in our notes payable or other borrowing arrangements that were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017.

We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements, including the $7.6 billion one-time transition tax described under Impacts of the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act above. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.  


Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options  

Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders.  

We recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2014 has been a weighted-average annualized rate of 1.2% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards or stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest and all stock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at February 28, 2018, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, 16.6% have exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. At February 28, 2018, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date, was 9.8%.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

The material set forth in Note 11 (pertaining to information regarding contingencies related to our income taxes) and Note 14 (pertaining to information regarding legal contingencies) of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference.  

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2017. The risks discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be insignificant also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results in the future.  

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  

Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On December 14, 2017 and February 2, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $24.0 billion. As of February 28, 2018, approximately $22.8 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program.  

Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
