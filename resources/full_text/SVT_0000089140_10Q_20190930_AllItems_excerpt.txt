SERVOTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (“consolidated financial statements”) have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019. The consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the 2018 annual report and the notes thereto. 

 2.Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Business Description 

Servotronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries, the Advanced Technology Group (“ATG”), that designs, manufactures and markets products consisting primarily of control components, and the Consumer Products Group (“CPG”), consisting of knives and various types of cutlery and other edged products. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Servotronics, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

Cash 

The Company considers cash to include all currency and coins owned by the Company as well as all deposits in the bank including checking accounts and savings accounts. 

Accounts Receivable 

The Company grants credit to substantially all of its customers and carries its accounts receivable at original invoice amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on history of past write-offs, collections, and current credit conditions. The allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to approximately $142,000 at September 30, 2019 and $170,000 at December 31, 2018. The Company does not accrue interest on past due receivables. 

Note Receivable 

There is a note receivable with a balance of $125,000 as of September 30, 2019 and recorded as other non-current assets in the accompanying balance sheet. The note is with a third party with the intent to develop a business venture. As of October 21, 2019, the note receivable plus an additional $18,000 was converted to capitalized tooling and owned by the CPG. The total capitalized tooling is approximately $143,000. The tooling will be used by an off-shore third party supplier for the initial production of new product for the new business venture.

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes all costs incurred to bring each product to its present location and condition. Market provisions in respect of lower of cost or market adjustments and inventory expected to be used in greater than two years are applied to the gross value of the inventory through a reserve of approximately $1,488,000 and $1,543,000 at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Pre-production and start-up costs are expensed as incurred. 


Shipping and Handling Costs 

Shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of cost of goods sold. 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost; expenditures for new facilities and equipment and expenditures which substantially increase the useful lives of existing plant and equipment are capitalized; expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon disposal of properties, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any profit or loss on disposition is included in income. 



Income Taxes 

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as operating loss and credit carryforwards. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return, combined New York, Connecticut and Texas state income tax returns and separate Pennsylvania and Arkansas income tax returns.

Supplemental Cash Flow Information 

Income taxes paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to approximately $0 and $875,000, respectively. Interest paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to approximately $88,000 and $80,000, respectively. 

Employee Stock Ownership Plan 

Contributions to the employee stock ownership plan are determined annually by the Company according to plan formula. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable based on undiscounted future operating cash flow analyses. If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value. Due to the losses incurred by our CPG segment, we performed a test for recoverability of the long-lived assets by comparing its carrying value to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect will be generated by the asset group. Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal. The Company has determined that no impairment of long-lived assets existed at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Reclassifications 

Certain balances, as previously reported, were reclassified to conform to classifications adopted in the current period. 

Research and Development Costs 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 

Concentration of Credit Risks 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risks principally consist of cash accounts in financial institutions. Although the accounts exceed the federally insured deposit amount, management does not anticipate nonperformance by the financial institutions. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The carrying amount of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable estimates of their fair value due to their short maturity. Based on variable interest rates and the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans similar to its long-term debt, the fair value approximates its carrying amount. 


SERVOTRONICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Revenue Recognition 

Revenues are recognized at the time of shipment of goods, transfer of title and customer acceptance, as required. Our revenue transactions generally consist of a single performance obligation to transfer contracted goods and are not accounted for under industry-specific guidance. Purchase orders generally include specific terms relative to quantity, item description, specifications, price, customer responsibility for in-process costs, delivery schedule, shipping point, payment and other standard terms and conditions of purchase. Service sales, principally representing repair, are recognized at the time of shipment of goods. 

The costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering, development and repair activities of our products under agreements with commercial customers are expensed as incurred. Subsequently, the revenue is recognized as products are delivered to the customers with the approval by the customers. 


Revenue excludes taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from a customer (e.g., sales and use taxes). Revenue includes payments for shipping activities that are reimbursed by the customer to the Company. 

Performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time. Performance obligations are supported by contracts with customers, providing a framework for the nature of the distinct goods, services or bundle of goods and services. The timing of satisfying the performance obligation is typically indicated by the terms of the contract. As a significant portion of the Company’s revenue are recognized at the time of shipment, transfer of title and customer acceptance, there is no significant judgment applied to determine the timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations or transaction price. 

The timing of satisfaction of our performance obligations does not significantly vary from the typical timing of payment. The Company generally receives payment for these contracts within the payment terms negotiated and agreed upon by each customer contract. 

Warranty and repair obligations are assessed on all returns. Revenue is not recorded on any warranty returns. The Company warrants its products against design, materials and workmanship based on an average of twenty-seven months. The Company determines warranty reserves needed based on actual average costs of warranty units shipped and current facts and circumstances. As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 under the guidance of ASC460 the Company has recorded a warranty reserve of approximately $420,000 and $428,000, respectively. This amount is reflected in other accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheet. Revenue is recognized on repair returns, covered under a customer contract, at the contractual price upon shipment to the customer.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” The new standard requires a lessee to record on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases with lease terms of more than 12 months and requires both lessees and lessors to disclose certain key information about lease transactions. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has four pieces of equipment financed through a lease line of credit and have recognized a lease liability and a ROU asset for each piece of equipment. Finance lease assets are included in property, plant, and equipment, and liabilities are included in short-term and long-term debt. Accounting for finance leases is substantially unchanged. 



 4.Property, Plant and Equipment 


Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to approximately $339,000 and $259,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization expense primarily related to ROU assets amounted to approximately $18,000 and $20,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to approximately $902,000 and $761,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization expense, primarily related to ROU assets, amounted to approximately $59,000 and $57,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company maintains property and casualty insurance in amounts adequate for the risk and nature of its assets and operations and which are generally customary in its industry.

The Company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 450,000 shares of its common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. As of September 30, 2019, the Company has purchased 360,255 shares and there remains 89,745 shares available to purchase under this program. There were 5,232 shares purchased by the Company during the nine month period ended September 30, 2019. 

On January 1, 2019, 26,250 shares of restricted stock vested of which 9,729 shares were withheld by the Company for approximately $99,000 to satisfy statutory minimum withholding tax requirements for those participants who elected this option as permitted under the Company’s 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. 

On May 25, 2018, the Company issued 78,750 shares of restricted stock to Executive Officers and certain key management of the Company under the Company’s 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The restricted share awards have varying vesting periods between January 2019 and January 2021; however, these shares have voting rights and accrue dividends prior to vesting. The accrued dividends are paid upon vesting of the restricted shares. The aggregate amount of expense to the Company, measured based on grant date fair value is expected to be approximately $735,000 and will be recognized over the requisite service period. 

The Company’s director compensation policy provides that non-employee directors receive a portion of their annual retainer in the form of restricted stock under the Company’s 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. These shares vest quarterly over a twelve month service period, have voting rights and accrue dividends that are paid upon vesting. The aggregate amount of expense to the Company, measured based on the grant date fair value, will be recognized over the requisite service period. An aggregate of 4,288 restricted shares were issued on May 25, 2018 with a grant date fair value of $40,000. An aggregate of 7,836 restricted shares were issued on April 26, 2019 with a grant date fair value of $100,000. 

On May 15, 2019 the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a $0.16 per share cash dividend. The dividend was subsequently paid on July 15, 2019 to shareholders of record on June 28, 2019 and was approximately $413,000 in the aggregate. These dividends do not represent that the Company will pay dividends on a regular or scheduled basis. The amount is recorded in dividends payable and as a reduction to retained earnings on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 

Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or any unvested restricted shares of common stock. These unvested restricted shares, although classified as issued and outstanding, are considered forfeitable until the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic EPS calculation until the shares are vested. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period plus the number of shares of common stock that would be issued assuming all contingently issuable shares having a dilutive effect on the earnings per share that were outstanding for the period. Incremental shares from assumed conversions are calculated as the number of shares that would be issued, net of the number of shares that could be purchased in the marketplace with the cash received upon stock option exercise. The dilutive effect of unvested restrictive stock is determined using the treasury stock method.

Upon retirement and after attaining at least the age of 65, the Company will pay for the retired Executive’s and dependent’s health benefits and will continue the Company-provided life insurance offered at the time of retirement. The retiree’s health insurance benefits ceases upon the death of the retired executive. Approximately $719,000 and $644,000 has been accrued as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and is reflected as Post Retirement Obligation in the accompanying balance sheet. 


Litigation. The Company has pending litigation relative to leases of certain equipment and real property with a former related party. Aero, Inc. is suing Servotronics, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary and has alleged damages in the amount of $3,000,000. The Company has filed a response to the Aero, Inc. lawsuit and has also filed a counter-claim in the amount of $3,191,000. The Company considers the risk of loss remote, and is unable to reasonably or accurately estimate the likelihood and amount of any liability or benefit that may be realized as a result of this litigation. Accordingly, no gain or loss has been recognized in the accompanying financials statements related to this litigation. 

There are no other legal proceedings currently pending by or against the Company other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the business or earnings of the Company.

The Company paid legal fees and disbursements of approximately $81,000 and $117,000 in the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for services provided by a law firm that is owned by a member of the Company’s Board of Directors. Legal fees paid for the three month period ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to approximately $33,000 and $23,000, respectively. Additionally, the Company had accrued unbilled legal fees at September 30, 2019 and 2018 of approximately $49,000 and $19,000, respectively, with this firm. 


The Company operates in two business segments, ATG and CPG. The Company’s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. The segments are composed of separate corporations and are managed separately. Operations in ATG primarily involve the design, manufacture, and marketing of servo-control components (i.e., torque motors, control valves, actuators, etc.) for government, commercial and industrial applications. CPG’s operations involve the design, manufacture and marketing of a variety of cutlery products for use by consumers and government agencies. The Company derives its primary sales revenue from domestic customers, although a portion of finished products are for foreign end use. 

As of September 30, 2019, the Company had identifiable assets of approximately $45,701,000 ($41,685,000 – December 31, 2018) of which approximately $36,339,000 ($31,639,000 – December 31, 2018) was for ATG and approximately $9,362,000 ($10,046,000 – December 31, 2018) was for CPG.

 Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview 

During the nine and three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 approximately 9% of the Company’s consolidated revenues were derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government or their prime contractors and their subcontractors. The Company believes that government involvement in military operations overseas will continue to have an impact on the financial results in both the ATG and CPG markets. While the Company is optimistic in relation to these potential opportunities, it recognizes that sales to the government are affected by defense budgets, the foreign policies of the U.S. and other nations, the level of military operations and other factors, and as such, it is difficult to predict the impact on future financial results. 

The Company’s commercial business is affected by such factors as uncertainties in today’s global economy, global competition, the vitality and ability of the commercial aviation industry to purchase new aircraft, the effects and threats of terrorism, market demand and acceptance both for the Company’s products and its customers’ products which incorporate Company made components. 


The CPG consumer products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets. Consumer sales are moderately seasonal. Sales are direct to consumer, through national and international distributors, and through retailers such as big box, hardware, supermarket, variety, department, discount, gift, drug, outdoors and sporting stores. The CPG also sells knives and tools, principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives, to various branches of the United States Government which accounted for less than 2% of the Company’s consolidate revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. 

See also Note 10, Business Segments, for information concerning business segment operating results. 


Results of Operations 





Revenue 

The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $3,159,000 or 9.0% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. During this period the ATG increased both commercial shipments by approximately $3,117,000 and government shipments by approximately $781,000. This was partially offset by the CPG decrease of commercial shipments by approximately $655,000 and government shipments by approximately $84,000. 

The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations decreased approximately $406,000 or 3.2% for the three month period ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. During this period the ATG increased both commercial shipments by approximately $197,000 and government shipments by approximately $344,000. This was offset by the CPG decrease of commercial shipments by approximately $889,000 and government shipments by approximately $58,000. 

Gross Margin 

The Company’s consolidated gross margin for the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 was flat when compared to the same period in 2018. 

Gross margin increased in the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 due to the increase in units shipped of approximately $797,000 and due to an increase in average prices and mix of product sold of approximately $301,000 at the ATG as compared to the same period of 2018. This is offset by a decrease in units shipped of approximately $377,000 and a decrease due to average prices and mix of product sold of approximately $758,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period of 2018. 

The Company’s consolidated gross margin for the three month period ended September 30, 2019 decreased approximately $405,000 or 10.3% when compared to the same period in 2018. 

Gross margin decreased in the three month period ended September 30, 2019 due to a decrease in units shipped, average prices and mix of product sold of approximately $533,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period of 2018. This is partially offset by an increase in the gross margin due to an increase in units shipped, average prices and mix of product sold of approximately $128,000 at the ATG as compared to the same period of 2018. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 




Interest Expense 

Interest expense increased by 10.0% and 10.7% in the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2019, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2018. This is primarily due to the higher interest rates on the bank loans and a full year of interest paid on the equipment financing lease obligations. 

Income Taxes 

The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 17.4% and 20.0% for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 17.4% and 20.7% for the three month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate in both years reflects federal and state income taxes, permanent non-deductible expenditures, the deduction for foreign-derived intangible income and the federal tax credit for research and development expenditures. 

Net Income 

Net income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 decreased approximately $551,000. This decrease is primarily the result of decreases at the CPG business segments and increases in selling, general and administrative expenses at both business segments. Net income for the three month period ended September 30, 2019 decreased approximately $325,000, when compared to the same periods in 2018. This decrease is primarily the result of decreases in gross margin at the CPG business segment and increases in selling, general and administrative expenses at the ATG business segments. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company’s primary liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relate to working capital needs; primarily inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and principal payments on debt. At September 30, 2019, the Company had working capital of approximately $24,978,000 ($23,141,000 – 2018) of which approximately $1,158,000 ($2,598,000 – 2018) was comprised of cash. The increase in working capital is attributable to an increase in inventory, mainly attributable to the ATG’s production increase slightly offset by improved number of days in accounts payable. 

The Company used approximately $245,000 in cash from operations during the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 as compared to a usage of cash of approximately $4,000 during the same period in 2018. Cash was generated primarily through net income of approximately $1,944,000, adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash of approximately $1,042,000 and timing of accounts payable of approximately $848,000. The primary use of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 include working capital requirements, mainly an increase in accounts receivables and inventories of approximately $334,000 and $4,674,000, respectively. Cash used in operations is consistent with sales volume, customer expectations and competitive pressures. 

The Company’s primary generation of cash in its financing and investing activities in the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 included approximately $676,000 of proceeds from equipment financing and the line of credit draw of approximately $1,000,000. This is offset by the usage of cash due to approximately $411,000 of principal payments on long-term debt, approximately $404,000 for the cash dividend paid in July, as well as capital expenditures of approximately $1,660,000 to increase production requirements at the ATG. 


The Company has a $4,000,000 line of credit. The interest rate is a rate per year equal to the bank’s prime rate or Libor plus 1.4%. In addition, effective June 17, 2019, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.15% on the unused portion of the line of credit. The line of credit expires September 19, 2021. There was $1,000,000 outstanding at September 30, 2019 and zero at December 31, 2018. 

The Company has an equipment loan facility in the amount of $2,500,000 available until November 30, 2019. This line is non-revolving and non-renewable. The loan term for the equipment covered by the agreement is 60 months. Monthly payments will be fixed for the term of each funding based upon the Lender’s lease pricing in effect at the time of such funding. There was approximately $661,000 outstanding at September 30, 2019 and no balance outstanding at December 31, 2018. 

The Company believes its cash generating capability and financial condition, together with available credit facilities will be adequate to meet our future operating, investing and financing needs.

The Company’s business is performed under fixed price contracts and the following factors, among others discussed herein, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: uncertainties in today’s global economy and global competition, and difficulty in predicting defense appropriations, the vitality of the commercial aviation industry and its ability to purchase new aircraft, the willingness and ability of the Company’s customers to fund long-term purchase programs, and market demand and acceptance both for the Company’s products and its customers’ products which incorporate Company-made components. The success of the Company also depends upon the trends of the economy, including interest rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes and those risk factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.
