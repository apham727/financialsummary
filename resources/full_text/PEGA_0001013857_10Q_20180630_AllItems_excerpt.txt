NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

Pegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.) for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

On January 1, 2018 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) using the full retrospective method which required each prior reporting period presented be adjusted to reflect the application of this ASU. See Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements for additional information.  

In the opinion of management, the Company has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on the same basis as its audited financial statements, and these financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented.  

The operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year 2018.  

2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

Financial Instruments  

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model for credit losses. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of other-than-temporary impairments. The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  

Leases  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets, recognizing a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects that most of its operating lease commitments will be subject to this ASU and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption with no material impact to its results of operations and cash flows.  

ASC 606 and ASC 340-40  

On January 1, 2018 the Company adopted the ASC 606 revenue recognition standard and has adjusted prior periods to conform.  


       

Perpetual licenses with extended payment terms and term licenses - Revenue from perpetual licenses with extended payment terms and term licenses is now recognized when control is transferred to the client, the point in time when the client can use and benefit from the license. Previously, the Company recognized revenue over the term of the agreements as payments became due or earlier if prepaid. Any unrecognized license revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period that control transfers or as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of December 31, 2015. Unbilled receivables in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets increased significantly upon adoption due to the revenue from term licenses being recognized prior to amounts billed, or prepaid by, clients and perpetual licenses with extended payment terms.  

       

Allocation of future credits and significant discounts - Perpetual or term licenses delivered are a separate performance obligation which now requires us to allocate any future credits and discounts to the performance obligations in the arrangement based upon their relative stand-alone selling prices.  

       

Deferred contract costs - Sales incentive programs and other incremental costs to obtain a contract were previously expensed when incurred. ASC 340-40 requires these costs be recognized as an asset when incurred and expensed over the period of expected benefit, which is on average five years. This change primarily impacts the Companys contracts related to multi-year cloud offerings, maintenance on term and perpetual licenses, and those long-term term and perpetual licenses with client usage rights that increase over time.

       

Taxes - The corresponding effect on tax balances of the above impacts has also been recognized.  

For additional information on the Companys accounting policies as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 see Note 4. Receivables, Contract Assets, and Deferred Revenue, Note 5. Deferred Contract Costs, and Note 9. Revenue.  




Includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, income taxes receivable, other current assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-term assets (as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017).

PEGASYSTEMS INC.  

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  


Adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 had no impact on total cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing activities in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2017.  




Table of Contents 

PEGASYSTEMS INC.  

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  


As of June 30, 2018, the Company did not hold any investments with unrealized losses that are considered to be other-than-temporary.  

As of June 30, 2018, remaining maturities of marketable securities ranged from July 2018 to August 2021, with a weighted-average remaining maturity of approximately 1.5 years.  

4. RECEIVABLES, CONTRACT ASSETS, AND DEFERRED REVENUE  

Receivables  


Unbilled receivables is the amount due from clients where the only condition on the right of payment is the passage of time. The Company regularly assesses receivables for collectability. As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the allowance for doubtful accounts was not material.  



Contract assets and deferred revenue  


 (1) Included in other current assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

 (2) Included in other long-term assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

 (3) Included in other long-term liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

Contract assets and deferred revenue are presented net at the contract level for each reporting period. Contract assets are amounts under client contracts where revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation. Deferred revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition.  


Table of Contents 

PEGASYSTEMS INC.  

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  

The change in deferred revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2018, was primarily due to new billings in advance of revenue recognition and $168.2 million of revenue recognized, excluding the impact of the netting of contract assets and deferred revenue, during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2017.  

Major clients  

No client represented 10% or more of the Companys total receivables as of June 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017.  

5. DEFERRED CONTRACT COSTS  

Sales incentives paid by the Company are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a client. These costs are deferred, as a long-term asset, and then amortized using the straight-line method over the period of benefit which is on average five years. The Company determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration client contracts, the Companys technology, and other factors. The Company utilizes a practical expedient available under ASC 606 to expense costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the original amortization period is one year or less.  


 (1) Included in other long-term assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.  



 (1) Included in selling and marketing expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.  

During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, impairment of deferred contract costs was not material.  

6. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  





 (1) Included in other long-term assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  

The Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and investments in privately-held companies at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  


       

Level 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  

       

Level 2 - significant other inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; and  

       

Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs on which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.  

The Companys cash equivalents are composed of money market funds and time deposits which are classified as Level 1 and Level 2, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy. The Companys marketable securities, which are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on a market approach using quoted prices, when available, or matrix pricing compiled by third party pricing vendors, using observable market inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, and credit risk. The Companys investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are valued using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.  


Table of Contents 

PEGASYSTEMS INC.  

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  

If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs. There were no transfers between levels during the six months ended June 30, 2018.  



 (1) Included in other long-term assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying value approximates their fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these items.  

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis  

Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including property and equipment and intangible assets, are recognized at fair value when they are impaired. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not recognize any impairments of its assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  


Revenue policy  


       

Software license revenue is primarily derived from sales of the Companys software applications and Pega Platform.  

       

Maintenance revenue includes revenue from client support including software upgrades, on a when and-if available basis, telephone support, and bug fixes or patches.  

       

Services revenue is primarily derived from cloud revenue, which is sales of the Companys hosted Pega Platform and software application environments and consulting revenue which is primarily related to new license implementations.  

Contracts with multiple performance obligations  

The Companys license and cloud arrangements often contain multiple performance obligations, including maintenance, consulting, and training. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. If the transaction price contains discounts or the Company expects to provide a future price concession, these elements are considered when determining the transaction price prior to allocation. Variable fees within the transaction price are estimated and recognized in revenue as the Company satisfies each performance obligation to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable fee is resolved. If the contract grants the client the option to acquire additional products or services, the Company assesses whether or not any discount on the included products and services is in excess of levels normally available to similar clients and, if so, accounts for that discount as an additional performance obligation.

PEGASYSTEMS INC.  

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  

Software licenses  

The Company has concluded that its software licenses are distinct performance obligations as the client can benefit from the software on its own. Software license revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the client, which is defined as the point in time when the client can use and benefit from the license. The software license is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without services, updates, and technical support. Stand-alone selling price for software licenses is determined using the residual approach. The Company utilizes the residual approach as license performance obligations are sold for a broad range of amounts (the selling price is highly variable) and a stand-alone selling price is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. Periodically, the Company evaluates whether the residual approach is appropriate for its license and cloud performance obligations when sold with other performance obligations. As a result, if the standalone selling price analysis illustrates that the license and cloud performance obligations are no longer highly variable, the Company will utilize the relative allocation method for such arrangements.  

Term license fees are usually payable in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the license agreement, which is typically three to five years and may be renewed for additional terms at the clients option. Perpetual license fees are usually payable when the contract is executed.  

Maintenance  

Software maintenance contracts entitle clients to receive technical support and software updates, on a when and if available basis, during the term of the maintenance contract. Technical support and software updates are considered distinct services but accounted for as a single performance obligation as they each constitute a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the client. Software maintenance revenue is recognized over time on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Maintenance fees are usually payable in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the agreement.  

Each of the performance obligations included in maintenance are priced as a percentage of the selling price of the related software license, which is highly variable. The Company determined the standalone selling price of each performance obligation included in maintenance based on this pricing relationship, which has remained constant within a narrow range, and observable data from standalone sales of maintenance, along with all other observable data.  

Services  

The Companys services revenue is comprised of consulting and training, including software license implementations, training, reimbursable expenses, and cloud which is derived from sales of the Companys hosted Pega Platform and software application environments. The Company has concluded that most services are distinct performance obligations. Consulting may be provided on a stand-alone basis or bundled with license and software maintenance services.  

The stand-alone selling price for consulting in time and materials contracts is determined by observable prices in similar transactions without multiple performance obligations and recognized as revenue as the services are performed. Fees for time and materials consulting contracts are usually payable shortly after the service is provided.  

The Company estimates the stand-alone selling price for fixed price services based on the estimated hours versus actual hours in similar geographies and for similar contract sizes. Revenue for fixed price services is recognized over time as the services are provided. Fees for fixed price services consulting contracts are usually payable as contract milestones are achieved.  

The stand-alone selling price of cloud sales of production environments is determined based on the residual approach when sold with services and is recognized over the term of the service. The Company utilizes the residual approach as cloud performance obligations are sold for a broad range of amounts (the selling price is highly variable) and a stand-alone selling price is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. The stand-alone selling price for cloud sales of development and testing environments is developed using observable prices in similar transactions without multiple performance obligations and is recognized over time over the term of the service. Cloud fees are usually payable in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the service.

Expense  


The Company recognizes stock-based compensation using the accelerated recognition method, treating each vesting tranche as if it were an individual grant. As of June 30, 2018, the Company had, net of estimated forfeitures, $79.7 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, related to all unvested restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options, which was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.  

Grants  




Includes approximately 0.1 million RSUs which were granted in connection with the election by certain employees to receive 50% of their 2018 target incentive compensation under the Companys Corporate Incentive Compensation Plan in the form of RSUs instead of cash. Stock-based compensation of approximately $8.2 million associated with this RSU grant is expected to be recognized over a one-year period beginning on the grant date.  

RSU vestings and stock option exercises  

During the six months ended June 30, 2018, 0.9 million shares of common stock were issued due to stock option exercises and RSU vestings under the Companys stock-based compensation plans.

Effective income tax rate  




       


       

a decrease in the estimated annual effective income tax rate primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. statutory federal tax rate from 35% to 21% pursuant to the Tax Reform Act;  

       

an increase in U.S. research and development tax credits; and  

       

a decrease in uncertain tax benefits as a result of the settlement of a foreign tax audit for 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.  

Tax reform act  

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act) was enacted into law, which significantly changed U.S. tax law and included many provisions, such as a reduction of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, imposed a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign earnings, and included a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of foreign subsidiaries, a special tax deduction for foreign derived intangible income, and a base erosion anti-abuse tax measure (BEAT) that may tax payments between a U.S. corporation and its foreign subsidiaries, among other tax changes.  

Under the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), the Company recognized the provisional tax impacts in the three months ended December 31, 2017 that included $20.4 million of income tax expense to re-measure its net deferred tax assets to the 21% enacted rate. However, the Company has revised its provisional amount to reflect the impact of the retrospective adoption of ASC 606 and has recognized a $12.6 million income tax benefit for the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities on a retrospective basis in the three months ended December 31, 2017.  

The final amounts may differ from those provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Reform Act.  

The Tax Reform Act also provided for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through December 31, 2017. However, based on the Companys provisional analysis performed as of that date, the Company does not expect to be subject to the one-time transition tax due to the Companys foreign subsidiaries being in a net accumulated deficit position. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized no significant adjustments to these estimates.  


       

The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax base foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiarys tangible assets. The Company expects that it will be subject to incremental U.S. tax resulting from GILTI inclusions beginning in 2018. As of June 30, 2018, the Company has included an estimate of the effect of its GILTI provisions in its estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company continues to monitor IRS guidance and will update its estimates as guidance is issued.  

       

The BEAT provisions in the Tax Reform Act impose an alternative minimum tax on taxpayers with substantial base-erosion payments. The Companys preliminary assessment is that the Company will not be subject to the BEAT in 2018. The Company continues to monitor IRS guidance and will update its estimates as guidance is issued.

12. EARNINGS PER SHARE  

Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and RSUs, using the treasury stock method. In periods of loss, all stock options and RSUs are excluded, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.  




Certain outstanding stock options and RSUs were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive in the period presented. These awards may be dilutive in the future.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICES  

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) and the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and expectations of what could occur in the future given available information.

Revenue  

We account for revenue in accordance with ASC 606. Our revenue recognition policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates.  

Our clients contracts with us typically contain promises by us to provide multiple products and services. Judgment is required to determine whether each product and service is considered to be a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately under the contract. We allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations based on relative stand-alone selling price. We estimate stand-alone selling price based on the prices charged to clients, or by using information such as market conditions and other observable inputs. However, the selling price of our software licenses and cloud performance obligations are highly variable. Thus, we estimate stand-alone selling price for software licenses and cloud performance obligations using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price minus the stand-alone selling price of other performance obligations promised in the contract.  

In applying our revenue recognition policy, we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred and recognized in future periods. We analyze various factors including, but not limited to, the selling price of undelivered services when sold on a stand-alone basis, our pricing policies, and contractual terms and conditions to help us make such judgments about revenue recognition. Changes in judgment on any of these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a given period.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  


Revenue  

License and Cloud Revenue  



Table of Contents 

We continue to experience a shift in client preferences from perpetual arrangements to term and cloud arrangements. Revenue for cloud arrangements is recognized over the service period of the cloud contract, as compared to license arrangements, which is generally recognized at the contract effective date.  

The decrease in term license revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to $35.3 million in revenue recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2017 from a large term license renewal.  

Maintenance  


The increases in maintenance revenue were primarily due to the continued growth in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software and strong renewal rates significantly in excess of 90%.  

Consulting and training  


Our consulting and training revenue may fluctuate in future periods depending on the mix of new implementation projects we perform as compared to those performed by our enabled clients or led by our partners.  

The increases in consulting and training revenue were primarily due to higher billable hours driven by an increase in the number of projects during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.  

Gross profit  


The increase in total gross profit in the three months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to a large term license recognized in revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2018.  

Maintenance and cloud gross profit percent  

The increases in maintenance gross profit percent in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were driven by decreases of $0.7 million and $1 million, respectively, in compensation and benefits due to decreased headcount and a decrease in client support expenses as we transferred resources to provide dedicated support to our growing cloud business.  

The increases in cloud gross profit percent in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were driven by cost efficiency gains as our cloud business continues to grow and scale, partially offset by an increase in client support expenses as we expanded our cloud client support function to sustain our growing cloud business.  

Consulting and training gross profit percent  

The decreases in consulting and training gross profit percent in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were driven primarily by lower utilization rates and the impact of our policy introduced late in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to offer our web-based training free of charge to users which reduced training revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 by $0.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively.

Operating expenses  

Selling and marketing  


Selling and marketing expenses include compensation, benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with our selling and marketing personnel as well as advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Selling and marketing expenses also include the amortization of client-related intangibles. The increase in headcount reflects our efforts to increase our sales capacity to target new accounts in existing industries, as well as to expand coverage in new industries and geographies, and to increase the number of sales opportunities.  

The increases in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of $13.7 million and $25.4 million, increased employee travel and entertainment, and increased expenses related to the realignment of contract negotiation resources.  

Research and development  


Research and development expenses include compensation, benefits, contracted services, and other headcount-related expenses associated with the creation and development of our products, as well as enhancements and design changes to existing products and the integration of acquired technologies.  

The increases in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of $1 million and $5.5 million, respectively, attributable to increased headcount and the expansion of our application development team to support the continued development of our expanding suite of software.  

General and administrative  


General and administrative expenses include compensation, benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, corporate governance, and other administrative headcount. They also include accounting, legal, and other professional consulting and administrative fees. The general and administrative headcount includes employees in human resources, information technology, and corporate services departments, whose costs are partially allocated to other operating expense areas.  

The decrease in the three months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits of $1.6 million, due to decreased headcount reflecting the realignment of contract negotiation and product development resources to augment our selling and marketing and research development functions, respectively.  

The increase in the six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to an increase of $1.2 million in legal fees.

Stock-based compensation  


The increase in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to the increased value of our annual periodic equity awards granted in March 2018 and 2017. These awards generally have a five-year vesting schedule.  








       

excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 of $11.4 million and $18.1 million were disproportionately greater relative to income before benefit from income taxes;  

       

a decrease in the estimated annual effective income tax rate primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. statutory federal tax rate from 35% to 21% pursuant to the Tax Reform Act;  

       

an increase in U.S. research and development tax credits; and  

       

a decrease in the balance of our uncertain tax positions as a result of the settlement of a foreign tax audit for 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.  

The inclusion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation in the provision for income taxes has increased the fluctuation of the effective tax rates in recent periods. This fluctuation may continue in future periods, as the amount of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation awards varies depending on our future stock price in relation to the fair value of awards, the timing of RSU vestings, exercise behavior of our stock option holders, and the total value of future grants of stock-based compensation awards.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  


We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations, quarterly cash dividends, and stock repurchases for at least the next 12 months.  

If it became necessary to repatriate foreign funds, we may be required to pay U.S. state and local taxes, as well as foreign taxes, upon repatriation. Due to the complexity of the income tax laws and the effects of the Tax Reform Act, it is impracticable to estimate the amount of taxes we would have to pay.  

Cash provided by operating activities  

The primary drivers during the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $71.8 million in cash generated from receivables and contract assets, largely due to increased cash collections and the timing of billings.  

The primary driver during the six months ended June 30, 2017 was net income of $56.7 million.  

Cash used in investing activities  

Cash used in investing activities is primarily driven by the timing of investment maturities and purchases of new investments.  

Cash used in financing activities  

We used cash primarily for repurchases of our common stock under our publicly announced stock repurchase programs, stock repurchases for tax withholdings for the net settlement of our equity awards, and the payment of our quarterly dividend.  

Stock Repurchase Program  

Since 2004, our Board of Directors has approved annual stock repurchase programs with the aggregate authority to repurchase up to $221.8 million of our common stock. Purchases under these programs have been made on the open market. As of June 30, 2018, $169.4 million had been repurchased, $46 million remained available for repurchase, and $6.4 million had expired.  

Common stock repurchases  



Represents activity under our publicly announced stock repurchase programs.  


During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, instead of receiving cash from the equity holders, we withheld shares with a value of $21.1 million and $20.7 million for the exercise price of options. These amounts have been excluded from the table above.  


Table of Contents 

Dividends  

During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we paid cash dividends of $4.7 million and $4.6 million. It is our current intention to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share, however, the Board of Directors may terminate or modify this dividend program at any time without prior notice.  

 ITEM 3.  

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily related to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Other than the item discussed below, there were no significant changes to our market risk exposure during the first six months ended June 30, 2018.  

See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a more complete discussion of our market risk exposure.  

Foreign currency exposure  

Translation Risk  

Our international sales are usually denominated in foreign currencies. However, the operating expenses of our foreign operations are also primarily denominated in foreign currencies, which partially offset our foreign currency exposure.  



Remeasurement Risk  

We have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our results of operations as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We are primarily exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with Australian dollar, Euro, and U.S. dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and intercompany receivables and payables held by our U.K. subsidiary, a British pound functional entity.  



 ITEM 4.
