 Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements  

 Note 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation  

 TESSCO Technologies Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (TESSCO, we, or the Company), architects and delivers innovative product and value chain solutions to support wireless systems. The Company provides marketing and sales services, knowledge and supply chain management, product-solution delivery and control systems utilizing extensive internet and information technology. Approximately 97% of the Company’s sales are made to customers in the United States. The Company takes orders in several ways, including phone, fax, online and through electronic data interchange. Almost all of the Company’s sales are made in United States Dollars.  

 In management’s opinion, the accompanying interim Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include all adjustments, consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position for the interim periods presented. These statements are presented in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the Company’s annual financial statements have been omitted from these statements, as permitted under the applicable rules and regulations. The results of operations presented in the accompanying interim Consolidated Financial Statements are not necessarily representative of operations for an entire year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.  

 Note 2. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  


 In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments which amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on expected losses rather than incurred losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. This may result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. This ASU is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and will adopt the standard on the first day of the Company’s 2021 fiscal year.  



 Table of Contents  


 Effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. This ASU requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets related to the rights and obligations created by those leases. The ASU also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to the nature, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The Company adopted this standard on the first day of the 2020 fiscal year, using a modified retrospective approach. This standard resulted in the Company recording a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases, but otherwise the standard did not have a material impact on the financial statements. Prior periods were not adjusted to reflect this change.   

 Effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The new standard changes the classification of certain cash payments and receipts within the cash flow statement. Specifically, payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, including third-party costs, premiums paid, and other fees paid to lenders that are directly related to the debt prepayment or debt extinguishment, excluding accrued interest, are now classified as financing activities. Previously, these payments were classified as operating expenses. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company, included herein.  

 Note 3. Stock-Based Compensation   

 The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal quarter and six months ended September 29, 2019 includes $391,800 and $730,700, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal quarter and six months ended September 30, 2018 includes $384,800 and $705,300, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense is primarily related to our Performance Stock Units (PSUs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and Stock Options, granted or outstanding under the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Stock and Incentive Plan (the “1994 Plan”) and 2019 Stock and Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan” and together with the 1994 Plan, the “Plans”), which was approved at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on July 25, 2019. No additional awards may be granted under the 1994 Plan, although awards outstanding under the 1994 Plan remain outstanding and governed by its terms.  



 During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) approved the grant of PSUs to select key employees, providing them with the opportunity to earn up to 45,500 shares of the Company’s common stock in the aggregate, depending upon whether certain earnings per share targets, and individual performance metrics, are satisfied, for fiscal year 2020. These not-yet-earned PSUs have only one measurement year (fiscal 2020), and assuming the performance 


 Table of Contents  

metrics are met to a sufficient extent, the shares earned at the end of fiscal 2020 on the basis of that performance will vest in four equal installments beginning on or about May 15, 2020 and continuing on the same date in calendar 2021, 2022 and 2023, provided that the respective employee remains employed by the Company on each such date. Pursuant to the typical PSU award agreement, however, performance metrics are deemed met upon the occurrence of a change in control, and shares earned are issued earlier upon the occurrence of a change in control, or death or disability of the employee, or upon termination of the employee’s employment without cause or by the employee for good reason, as those terms are defined in the applicable PSU award agreement. In connection with his hiring as President and Chief Executive Officer on August 20, 2019, the Compensation Committee, with concurrence of the full Board of Directors, granted an additional PSU to Mr. Mukerjee, providing him with the opportunity to earn up to 6,116 shares of the Company’s common stock. This PSU was granted on the same terms as the PSUs granted in May 2019, except that this PSU was granted under the 2019 Plan and any shares earned pursuant to it on the basis of fiscal 2020 performance will vest in four equal installments beginning on the first anniversary of the commencement of the employment of Mr. Mukerjee and continue in calendar 2021, 2022 and 2023 on the same date as the other PSUs vest, provided that Mr. Mukerjee remains employed by the Company on each such date.  

 The PSUs cancelled during fiscal 2020 primarily related to the fiscal 2019 grant of PSUs, which also had a one-year measurement period (fiscal 2019). The PSUs were cancelled because the applicable fiscal 2019 performance targets were not fully attained. Per the provisions of the 1994 Plan, the shares related to these forfeited and cancelled PSUs were added back to the 1994 Plan and became available for future issuance under the 1994 Plan.  

 If all PSUs granted thus far in fiscal 2020 are assumed to be earned on account of the applicable performance metrics being fully met, or otherwise in accordance with terms of the applicable award agreement, total unrecognized compensation costs on these PSUs plus all earned but unvested PSUs would be approximately $0.9 million as of September 29, 2019, and would be expensed through fiscal 2023. To the extent the maximum number of PSUs granted in fiscal 2020 are not earned, stock-based compensation related to these awards will differ from this amount.  


 On August 8, 2017, the Compensation Committee, with the concurrence of the full Board of Directors, approved the grant of an aggregate of up to 56,000 RSUs to several senior executives. The number of shares earned by a recipient is determined by multiplying the number of RSUs covered by the award by a fraction, the numerator of which is the cumulative amount of dividends (regular, ordinary and special) declared and paid, per share, on the Common Stock, over an earnings period of up to four years, and the denominator of which is $3.20. Subject to earlier issuance upon the occurrence of certain events (as described in the applicable award agreement), any earned shares are issued and distributed to the recipient upon the fourth anniversary of the award date. As of September 29, 2019, 8,000 of these 56,000 RSUs have been canceled due to employee departures, leaving 48,000 of the 56,000 RSUs outstanding. An additional 2,000 RSU’s with similar terms (but with a shorter earnings period) were awarded in fiscal 2019, and in connection with his hiring as our new President and Chief Executive Officer, the Company issued an additional RSU grant to Mr. Mukerjee under the 2019 Plan for 


 Table of Contents  

19,000 shares and with similar terms (a four-year earning period and a denominator of $3.20). As a result, an aggregate of 69,000 dividend-based RSUs currently remain outstanding.  

 As of September 29, 2019, there was approximately $0.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all outstanding RSUs, assuming all shares are earned. Unrecognized compensation costs are expected to be recognized ratably over a weighted average period of approximately three years.   

 PSUs and RSUs are expensed based on the grant date fair value, calculated as the closing price of TESSCO common stock as reported by Nasdaq on the date of grant minus the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the common stock before the award vests, because dividends or dividend-equivalent amounts do not accrue and are not paid on unvested PSUs and RSUs.   

 The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimate expected forfeitures. To the extent that forfeitures occur, stock-based compensation related to the restricted awards may be different from the Company’s expectations.   


 The value of each option at the date of grant is amortized as compensation expense over the service period. This occurs without regard to subsequent changes in stock price, volatility, or interest rates over time, provided the option remains outstanding.   

 The following tables summarize the pertinent information for outstanding options.

 As of September 29, 2019, there was approximately $0.9 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to these options. These unrecognized compensation costs are expected to be recognized ratably over a period of approximately three years.   

 Note 4. Borrowings Under Revolving Credit Facility  

 On October 19, 2017, the Company and its primary operating subsidiaries, as co-borrowers, and SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent and Lender, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as a Lender, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), which amended and restated the terms of a previously established secured Revolving Credit Facility with the same lenders , and which resulted in, among other modifications, an increase in the Company’s borrowing limit to up to $75 million, from the previous borrowing limit of up to $35 million. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this and the following three paragraphs have the meanings ascribed to each in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  


 Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement initially accrue interest from the applicable borrowing date at an Applicable Rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin. The Eurodollar Rate is the rate per annum obtained by dividing (i) LIBOR by (ii) a percentage equal to 1.00 minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage. When the Applicable Rate is the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin, the Applicable Margin is 1.50% if Average Availability is greater than or equal to $15 million, and 1.75% otherwise. On September 29, 2019, the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the secured Revolving Credit Facility was 3.61%. Under certain circumstances, the Applicable Rate is subject to change at the Lenders’ option from the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. Following an Event of Default, in addition to changing the Applicable Rate to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, the Lenders’ may at their option set the Applicable Margin at 0.50% if the Base Rate applies or 1.75% if the Eurodollar Rate applies, and increase the Applicable Rate by an additional 200 basis points. 


 Table of Contents  

The Applicable Rate adjusts on the first Business Day of each calendar month. The Company is required to pay a monthly Commitment Fee on the average daily unused portion of the secured Revolving Credit Facility provided for pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, at a per annum rate equal to 0.25%.  

 In connection with the entering into of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company, the other Company affiliate borrowers under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and other subsidiaries of the Company, referred to collectively as the Loan Parties, executed and delivered to SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent, a Reaffirmation Agreement, pursuant to which the obligations of the Loan Parties under a Guaranty and Security Agreement previously delivered by them in connection with the secured Revolving Credit Facility as previously existing (including the previously existing guaranty by the Loan Parties not otherwise Borrowers and the previously existing grant by the Company and the other Loan Parties of a continuing first priority security interest in inventory, accounts receivable and deposit accounts, and on all documents, instruments, general intangibles, letter of credit rights, and all proceeds) were ratified and confirmed as respects the Obligations arising from time to time under the secured Revolving Credit Facility provided for under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and as respects certain other obligations of the Loan Parties to the Lenders and their affiliates arising from time to time, relating to swaps, hedges and cash management and other bank products.   

 Borrowings may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, and as further provided in, and subject to the applicable terms of, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of September 29, 2019, borrowings under the secured Revolving Credit Facility totaled $35.3 million and, therefore, the Company had $39.7 million available for borrowing as of September 29, 2019, subject to the Borrowing Base limitation and compliance with the other applicable terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the covenants referenced above. The line of credit has a lockbox arrangement associated with it and therefore the outstanding balance is classified as a current liability on our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2019, borrowings under the secured Revolving Credit Facility totaled $14.4 million and, therefore, the Company had $60.6 million available on its revolving line of credit facility as of March 31, 2019, again subject to the Borrowing Base limitation and compliance with the other applicable terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the covenants referenced above.  

 Note 5. Earnings Per Share  

 The Company presents the computation of earnings per share (“EPS”) on a basic and diluted basis. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reported period. Diluted earnings per share is computed similarly to basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential additional common shares that were dilutive had been issued. Common shares are excluded from the calculation if they are determined to be anti-dilutive. At September 29, 2019, stock options with respect to 678,375 shares of common stock were outstanding, of which 229,000 were anti-dilutive. At September 30, 2018, stock options with respect to 574,000 shares of common stock were outstanding, of which 50,000 were anti-dilutive. There were no anti-dilutive PSUs or RSUs outstanding as of September 29, 2019 or September 30, 2018, respectively.

 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations from the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.  

 Business Overview and Environment  

 TESSCO architects and delivers innovative product and value chain solutions to support wireless broadband systems. Although we sell products to customers in many countries, approximately 97% of our sales are made to customers in the United States. We have operations and office facilities in Hunt Valley, Maryland, Reno, Nevada and San Antonio, Texas.   



 Our ongoing ability to earn revenues and gross profits from customers and suppliers looking to us for product and supply chain solutions depends upon a number of factors. The terms, and accordingly the factors, applicable to each relationship often differ. Among these factors are the strength of the customer’s or supplier’s business, the supply and demand for the product or service, including price stability, changing customer or supplier requirements, and our ability to support the customer or supplier and to continually demonstrate that we can improve the way they do business. In addition, the agreements or arrangements on which our customer and supplier relationships are based are typically of limited duration, typically do not include any obligation in respect of any specific product purchase or sale and are terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise relatively short notice. Because of the nature of our business, we have been affected from time to time in the past by the loss and changes in the business habits of significant customer and supplier relationships, and expect that we will again be so affected from time to time in the future. Our customer relationships could 


 Table of Contents  

also be affected by wireless carrier consolidation or the overall global economic environment.  

 The wireless communications distribution industry is competitive and fragmented and is comprised of several national distributors. In addition, many manufacturers sell direct. Barriers to entry for distributors are relatively low, particularly in the mobile devices and accessories market, and the risk of new competitors entering the marketplace is high. Consolidation of larger wireless carriers has and will most likely continue to impact our current and potential customer base. Our ability to maintain customer and supplier relationships is subject to competitive pressures and challenges. We believe, however, that our strength in service, the breadth and depth of our product offering, our information technology system, industry experience and knowledge, and our large customer base and purchasing relationships with approximately 400 manufacturers, provide us with a significant competitive advantage over new entrants to the marketplace.  

 Results of Operations  

 Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2019  

 Total Revenues. Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased 10.6% compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Revenues in our public carrier market, value-added resellers and integrators market and retail market decreased by 1.3%, 6.1% and 24.1%, respectively. The decline in the commercial segment was primarily due to a decrease in revenue in our value-added resellers and integrators market where we are not yet realizing the full benefits of our sales reorganization. The decline in the retail segment was driven by significantly lower revenues from one of our more significant retail customers following its acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, change in business model and subsequent transition of its business elsewhere, as well as ongoing overall market softness.  

 Total Gross Profit. Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased by 16.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume combined with the impact of tariffs. Overall gross profit margin decreased from 19.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to 18.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Within our commercial segment, gross profit margin in our public carrier market increased from 12.0% to 12.4% due to changes in customer mix. Gross profit margin in our value-added resellers and integrators market decreased from 24.6% to 23.8%. This decline was due to a change in product mix, including lower sales of our higher margin Ventev products in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Within our retail segment, gross profit margin decreased from 19.3% to 16.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the impact of tariffs.  

 As discussed above under the heading “Business Overview and Environment,” our ongoing ability to earn revenues and gross profits from customers and suppliers depends upon a number of factors which often differ for each relationship. Agreements or arrangements on which these relationships are based typically do not include any obligation in respect of any specific product purchase or sale, are of limited duration, and are terminable by either party upon relatively short notice. We have been affected from time to time in the past by the loss and changes in the business habits of significant customer and supplier relationships, and expect that we will again be so affected from time to time in the future.   

 Selling, General, Administrative and Restructuring Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $3.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 18.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, to 18.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020.  


 Table of Contents  

 The decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease of $1.5 in freight expense, $1.0 million in compensation expense, $0.7 million in rewards expense, and $0.6 million in marketing expense, during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. These decreases were largely due to the decline in overall revenues.   

 We continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve based on this evaluation. We also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective and current customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such customers based on this evaluation. We had bad debt recovery, net of expense, of $107,900 and bad debt expense of $665,100 for the three months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively.   

 Interest, Net. Net interest expense increased from $244,800 for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to $335,100 for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Increased focus on business opportunities for sales to our public carrier customers has required us to maintain increased inventory levels, and at times has resulted in increased borrowings and interest expense under our secured Revolving Credit Facility (discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). We expect this higher level of interest expense to continue for at least the next several quarters.   

 Income Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share. The effective tax rate increased from 28.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to 90.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate is the result of permanent and other tax adjustments remaining consistent year over year while pre-tax income decreased year over year. The significant increase in rates is also due to a change in estimated fiscal year pre-tax earnings from the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to the second quarter of fiscal 2020, resulting in a significant adjustment in this quarter’s rate. Net income decreased 98.2% and diluted earnings per share decreased 100% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the corresponding prior-year quarter.   

 First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2019  

 Total Revenues. Revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2019 decreased 12.0% compared with the first six months of fiscal 2019. Revenues in our public carrier market, value-added resellers and integrators market and retail market decreased by 9.2%, 3.4% and 26.3%, respectively. The decline in the commercial segment was primarily due to the project-oriented nature of this business. Several large customers adjusted their forecasts or pushed out their product requirements from the first six months into the remainder of the fiscal year. The decline in the retail segment was driven by significantly lower revenues from one of our more significant retail customers following its acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, change in business model and subsequent transition of its business elsewhere, as well as ongoing overall market softness.  

 Total Gross Profit. Gross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2020 decreased by 16.9% compared to the first six months of fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume combined with the impact of tariffs. Overall gross profit margin decreased from 20.1% in the first six months of fiscal 2019 to 18.9% in the first six months of fiscal 2020. Within our commercial segment, gross profit margin in our public carrier market and value-added resellers and integrators market decreased slightly from 13.0% to 12.5%, and 24.5% to 24.1%, respectively due to changes in customer mix. Within our retail segment, gross profit margin decreased from 19.8% to 15.9% in the first six months of fiscal 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the impact of tariffs and inventory write-offs.  

 As discussed above under the heading “Business Overview and Environment,” our ongoing ability to earn revenues and gross profits from customers and suppliers depends upon a number of factors which often differ for each relationship. Agreements or arrangements on which these relationships are based typically do not

include any obligation in respect of any specific product purchase or sale, are of limited duration, and are terminable by either party upon relatively short notice. We have been affected from time to time in the past by the loss and changes in the business habits of significant customer and supplier relationships, and expect that we will again be so affected from time to time in the future.   

 Selling, General, Administrative and Restructuring Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $4.6 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020, compared to the first six months of fiscal 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from 18.9% for the first six months of fiscal 2019, to 19.8% for the first six months of fiscal 2020.  

 The decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease of $1.5 million in freight expense, $1.5 million in compensation expense, and $1.4 million in rewards expense, during the first six months of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2019. These decreases were largely due to the decline in overall revenues.  

 The Company also incurred a $0.5 million restructuring charge related to severance expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2020.  

 We continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve based on this evaluation. We also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective and current customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such customers based on this evaluation. We incurred bad debt expense, net of recovery, of $27,500 and $1,021,300 for the six months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively.   

 Interest, Net. Net interest expense increased from $419,200 for the first six months of fiscal 2019 to $543,800 for the first six months of fiscal 2020. Increased focus on business opportunities for sales to our public carrier customers has required us to maintain increased inventory levels, and at times has resulted in increased borrowings and interest expense under our secured Revolving Credit Facility (discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). We expect this higher level of interest expense to continue for at least the next several quarters.   

 Income Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share. The effective tax rate decreased from 27.4% for the first six months of fiscal 2019 to 24.9% for the first six months of fiscal 2020. Net income decreased 205.2% and diluted earnings per share decreased 207.4% for the first six months of fiscal 2020, compared to the first six months of fiscal 2019.   

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 The following table summarizes our cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the six months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018.  



 Table of Contents  

 We used $14.0 million of net cash from operating activities for the first six months of fiscal 2020, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $3.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2019. This fiscal 2020 outflow was driven by a net loss and an increase in inventory. Both current and potential opportunities within our public carrier business caused a significant investment in inventory.   

 Net cash used in investing activities of $3.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020 increased from cash used of $2.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2019. Cash used in both periods was due to capital expenditures largely comprised of investments in information technology.   

 Net cash provided by financing activities was $17.4 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020, compared to $5.5 million provided in the first six months of fiscal 2019. We utilized our asset based secured Revolving Credit Facility during the first six months of fiscal 2020 and 2019, leading to a cash inflow of $20.9 million and $8.9 million, respectively, during those periods. We had cash outflows of $3.4 million during the first six months of both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, due to cash dividends paid to shareholders.   

 On October 19, 2017, the Company and its primary operating subsidiaries, as co-borrowers, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as a lender (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), which amended and restated the terms of a previously established secured Revolving Credit Facility and which resulted in, among other modifications, an increase in the Company’s borrowing limit to up to $75 million, from the previous borrowing limit of up to $35 million. In addition to increasing the borrowing limit, and among other modifications, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement extended the applicable maturity date to October 19, 2021. As of September 29, 2019, borrowings under the secured Revolving Credit Facility totaled $35.3 million; therefore, we then had $39.7 million available, subject to the Borrowing Base limitations and compliance with the other applicable terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the financial and other covenants discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement accrue interest at the rates, and the Company is required to pay a monthly commitment fee, as also discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

 In connection with the entering into of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company and the other Company affiliate borrowers under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and other subsidiaries, referred to collectively as the Loan Parties, executed and delivered to SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent, a Reaffirmation Agreement, pursuant to which the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Guaranty and Security Agreement previously delivered by the Loan Parties in connection with the secured Revolving Credit Facility as previously existing (including the previously existing guaranty by the Loan Parties not otherwise Borrowers and the previously existing grant by the Company and the other Loan Parties of a continuing first priority security interest in inventory, accounts receivable and deposit accounts, and on all documents, instruments, general intangibles, letter of credit rights, and all proceeds) were ratified and confirmed as respects the Obligations arising from time to time under the secured Revolving Credit Facility provided for pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.   

 We have made quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock since the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Our most recent quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share was paid in August 2019. On October 29, 2019, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.20 per share, payable on November 27, 2019 to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2019.   

 Any future declaration of dividends and the establishment of any corresponding record and payment dates remains subject to further determination from time to time by the Board of Directors.

 In addition, our liquidity could be negatively impacted by decreasing revenues and profits resulting from a decrease in demand for our products or a reduction in capital expenditures by our customers, or by the weakened financial conditions of our customers or suppliers, in each case as a result of a downturn in the global economy, among other factors.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  

 The Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.

Based on the evaluation of these controls and
