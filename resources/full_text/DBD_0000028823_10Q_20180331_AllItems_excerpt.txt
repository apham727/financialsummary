 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements




The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and therefore do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP); however, such information reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.

The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, some of the Company’s statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q may involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected future results. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year.

The Company has reclassified the presentation of certain prior-year information to conform to the current presentation. The Company included finance lease receivables of $13.3 and $14.4 in other assets as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)



Recently Issued Accounting Guidance



Revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. 

The Company's payment terms vary depending on the individual contracts and are generally fixed fee. The Company recognizes advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue. In certain contracts where services are provided prior to billing, the Company recognizes a contract asset within trade receivables.

Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.

The Company recognizes shipping and handling fees billed when products are shipped or delivered to a customer and includes such amounts in net sales. Although infrequent, shipping and handling associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer is not a separate performance obligation, rather is accounted for as a fulfillment cost. Third-party freight payments are recorded in cost of sales.

The Company includes a warranty in connection with certain contracts with customers, which are not considered to be separate performance obligations. The Company provides its customers a manufacturer’s warranty and records, at the time of the sale, a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs. For additional information on product warranty refer to note 9. The Company also has extended warranty and service contracts available for its customers, which are recognized as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized on these contracts ratably as the Company has a stand-ready obligation to provide services when or as needed by the customer. This input method is the most accurate assessment of progress toward completion the Company can apply.

Nature of goods and services 

The following is a description of principal activities, separated by reportable operating segments, from which the Company generates its revenue. For more detailed information about reportable operating segments, see note 20.

Services

Product-related services provided by the Company include proactive monitoring and rapid resolution of incidents through remote service capabilities or an on-site visit. First and second line maintenance, preventive maintenance and on-demand services keep the distributed assets of the Company's customers up and running through a standardized incident management process. Managed services and outsourcing consists of the end-to-end business processes, solution management, upgrades and transaction processing. The Company also provides a full array of cash management services, which optimizes the availability and cost of physical currency across the enterprise through efficient forecasting, inventory and replenishment processes.

Services may be sold separately or in bundled packages. The typical contract length for service is generally one year and is billed and paid in advance except for installations, among others. 

For bundled packages, the Company accounts for individual services separately if they are distinct. A distinct service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells the services. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates stand-alone selling prices using the cost plus expected margin approach. Revenue on service contracts is recognized ratably over time, generally using an input measure, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance as the services are performed. In some circumstances, when global service supply chain services are not included in a term contract and rather billed as they occur, revenue on these billed work services are recognized at a point in time as transfer of control occurs. 

The Company applies the ‘as invoiced’ practical expedient related to performance obligations satisfied over time which permits the Company to recognize revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice the customer if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date.

Software

The Company provides front-end applications for consumer connection points and back-end platforms that manage channel transactions, operations and integration. These hardware-agnostic software applications facilitate millions of transactions via automated teller machines (ATMs), point of sale (POS) terminals, kiosks and other self-service devices. The Company's platform software is installed within bank and retail data centers to facilitate omnichannel transactions, endpoint monitoring, remote asset management, customer marketing, merchandise management and analytics. These offerings include highly configurable, application program interface (API) enabled software that automates legacy banking and retail transactions across channels.

The Company’s software solution includes its professional services team who provide systems integration, customization, consulting and project management. The Company’s advisory services team collaborates with its customers to help define optimal user experience, improve business processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technology to meet branch and store automation objectives.

Software licenses and professional services may be sold separately or in bundled packages. Software licenses when bundled with significant professional services, where the service is modifying the intellectual property (IP), is non-distinct from the professional service. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between distinct obligations in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates stand-alone selling prices using the cost plus expected margin approach or in the case of the software license the residual approach may be used. The Company’s software licenses are functional in nature (the IP has significant standalone functionality); as such, the revenue recognition of distinct software license sales is at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the rights granted by the license. Revenue from professional services are recognized over time, because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance as the services are performed. In the case of more significant professional services agreements, when the Company’s performance creates an asset with no alternative use to the Company and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, revenue is also recognized over time. Generally revenue will be recognized using an input measure, typically cost incurred, in the more significant professional services agreements.

Systems

The systems portfolio for banking customers consists of cash recyclers and dispensers, intelligent deposit terminals, teller automation tools and physical security devices. For retail customers, the checkout portfolio includes modular, integrated and mobile POS systems that meet evolving automation and omnichannel requirements of consumers. Supplementing the POS system is a broad range of peripherals, including printers, scales and mobile scanners, as well as the cash management portfolio which offers a wide range of banknote and coin processing systems. Also in the portfolio, the Company provides self-checkout terminals and ordering kiosks which facilitate an efficient and user-friendly purchasing experience. The Company’s hybrid product line can alternate from an attended operator to self-checkout with the press of a button as traffic conditions warrant throughout the business day.

For bundled packages, the Company accounts for individual system products separately if they are distinct - i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between distinct obligations in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells the products. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates stand-alone selling prices using the cost plus expected margin approach. Revenue on systems is recognized at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the system, which could be upon delivery or upon completion of installation services, depending on contract terms. 

Disaggregation of revenue



Contract balances



Contract assets are minimal for the periods presented. The amount of revenue recognized in 2018 from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, mainly due to the changes in the estimate of variable consideration and contract modifications was de minimis. There have been $8.8 and $9.8 impairment losses recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to receivables or contract assets arising from the Company's contracts with customers.

As of January 1, 2018, the Company had $437.5 of unrecognized deferred revenue constituting the remaining performance obligations that are either unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied). In 2018, the Company recognized revenue of $121.9 related to the Company's deferred revenue balance at January 1, 2018.

Contract assets are the rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Contract assets of the Company primarily relate to the Company's rights to consideration for goods shipped and services provided but not contractually billable at the reporting date.

DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

FORM 10-Q as of March 31, 2018

 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)



The contract assets are reclassified into the receivables balance when the rights to receive payment become unconditional. Contract liabilities are recorded for any services billed to customers and not yet recognizable if the contract period has commenced or for the amount collected from customers in advance of the contract period commencing. In addition, contract liabilities are recorded as advanced payments for products and other deliverables that are billed to and collected from customers prior to revenue being recognizable.

Transaction price and variable consideration

The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. This consideration can include fixed and variable amounts and is determined at contract inception and updated each reporting period for any changes in circumstances. The transaction price also considers variable consideration, time value of money and the measurement of any non-cash consideration, all of which are estimated at contract inception and updated at each reporting date for any changes in circumstances. 

Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations

As of March 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $2,200. The Company expects to recognize revenue on the remaining performance obligations over the next twelve months. The Company enters into service agreements with cancellable terms after a certain period without penalty. Unsatisfied obligations reflect only the obligation during the initial term. The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. 

Cost to obtain and cost to fulfill a contract 

The Company has minimal cost to obtain or fulfill contracts for customers for the periods presented. The Company pays commissions to the sales force based on multiple factors including but not limited to order entry, revenue recognition and portfolio growth. These incremental commission fees paid to the sales force meet the criteria to be considered a cost to obtain a contract, as they are directly attributable to a contract, incremental and management expects the fees are recoverable. The Company applies the practical expedient and recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. The costs that are not capitalized are included in cost of sales. The costs related to contracts with greater than a one-year term are immaterial and continue to be recognized in cost of sales.

Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of sales. The Company has minimal cost for shipping and handling costs for the periods presented.

Changes in accounting policies

Except for the changes below, the Company has consistently applied the accounting policies to all periods presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements.

The Company adopted Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, with a date of initial application of January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed below. 

The Company applied Topic 606 using the cumulative effect method - i.e. by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying Topic 606 as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at January 1, 2018. Therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under Topic 605. The Company applied the practical expedient related to assessment of contract modifications, whereby the Company is essentially allowed to use hindsight when assessing the effect of a modification and accounting for the modified contract as if it existed from the beginning of the original contract. 

The details of the significant changes and quantitative impact of the changes are set out below.

 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)



Professional service contracts

Previously, the Company recognized revenue for professional services contracts either on a milestone method or completed contract basis. Under Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control transfers to a customer. As professional services can be highly customized for each customer, there is no alternative use for the services. When there is an enforceable right to payment for service completed combined with no alternative use of the services, the services meet criteria for over time revenue recognition. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided and as the customer benefits from the service. Revenue is recognized progressively based on the costs incurred method. When the professional services are not highly customized as in basic software installation services, customers do not take control of the services until they are completed. Therefore, the Company continues to recognize revenue for such contracts when the services are completed and customers formally accept them.

Impacts on financial statements

The following tables summarize the impacts of adopting Topic 606 on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended March 31, 2018 as if the Company continued to follow its accounting policies under the previous revenue recognition guidance.


The impact to net sales and cost of sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 would have been an increase of $0.9 and a decrease of $0.3, respectively. The impact after tax was $0.8 and was primarily a result of timing of deferred revenue related to Systems and Software for certain amounts being recognized that would have previously been deferred, and certain amounts being deferred that would have previously been recognized.


Basic earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding. Under the two-class method of computing earnings (loss) per share, non-vested share-based payment awards that contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends are considered participating securities. The Company’s participating securities include restricted stock units (RSUs), director deferred shares and shares that were vested but deferred by employees. The Company calculated basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share under both the treasury stock method and the two-class method. For the years presented there were no differences in the earnings (loss) per share amounts calculated under the two methods. Accordingly, the treasury stock method is disclosed below.

In May 2018, the Company announced its decision to reallocate future dividend funds towards debt reduction and other capital resource needs.


The Company’s share-based compensation payments to employees are recognized based on their grant-date fair values during the period in which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. Share-based compensation is primarily recognized as a component of selling and administrative expense. Total share-based compensation expense was $13.7 and $6.8 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Performance shares are granted to employees and vest based on the achievement of certain performance objectives, as determined by the board of directors each year. Each performance share earned entitles the holder to one common share of the Company. The Company's performance shares include performance objectives that are assessed after a three-year period as well as performance objectives that are assessed annually over a three-year period. No shares are vested unless certain performance threshold objectives are met.

As of March 31, 2018, there were 0.1 non-employee director deferred shares vested and outstanding.

On April 25, 2018, the Company's shareholders approved amendments to the 2017 Plan, which provide for an additional 1.2 common shares available for grant. The 2017 Plan is expected to attract and retain directors, officers and employees of the Company by providing incentives and rewards for performance.

The effective tax rate on the net loss was (44.2) percent three months ended March 31, 2018. The tax expense on the loss is due primarily from impacts of the Tax Act, more specifically, impacts related to the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) on the estimated annual tax rate. The effective tax rate could vary in future periods based on the Company's earnings before taxes and clarifications around the Tax Act.

The effective tax rate on the net loss was 30.2 percent for the three months ended 2017. Companies are required to apply their estimated annual tax rate on a year-to-date basis in each interim period. Companies should not apply the estimated annual tax rate to interim financial results if the estimated annual tax rate is not reliably predictable. In this situation, the interim tax rate should be based on the actual year-to-date results. As of March 31, 2017, the Company was not able to reasonably estimate the annual effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2017, because small fluctuations in the Company's earnings before taxes could have resulted in a material change in the estimated annual tax rate. For this reason, the Company did not believe the estimated annual tax rate would provide a reliable estimate and as a result, the Company computed the interim tax rate based on the actual year-to-date results. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily a result of the jurisdictional income (loss) mix and varying statutory rates in the Company's global footprint.





The Company’s investments, primarily in Brazil, consist of certificates of deposit that are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in AOCI. Realized gains and losses are recognized in investment income and are determined using the specific identification method. There were no realized gains from the sale of securities or proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.

In May 2017, the Company announced a strategic partnership with Kony, a leading enterprise mobility and application company, to offer white label mobile application solutions for financial institutions and retailers. The Company acquired a minority equity stake in Kony, which is accounted for using the cost method of accounting. As of March 31, 2018, the Company's carrying value in Kony was $14.0 and the fair value was not estimated as there were no events or changes in circumstances in the investment. 

Securities and other investments also includes a cash surrender value of insurance contracts of $78.8 and $79.8 as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

The Company has finance lease receivables of $13.3 and $14.4 in other assets as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

There were no significant changes in provision for credit losses, recoveries and write-offs during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. As of March 31, 2018, finance leases and notes receivable individually evaluated for impairment were $32.4 and $15.0, respectively, with no provision recorded. As of March 31, 2017, finance leases and notes receivable individually evaluated for impairment were $56.9 and $18.6, respectively.

The Company records interest income and any fees or costs related to financing receivables using the effective interest method over the term of the lease or loan. The Company reviews the aging of its financing receivables to determine past due and delinquent accounts. Credit quality is reviewed at inception and is re-evaluated as needed based on customer-specific circumstances. Receivable balances 60 days to 89 days past due are reviewed and may be placed on nonaccrual status based on customer-specific circumstances. Receivable balances are placed on nonaccrual status upon reaching greater than 89 days past due. Upon receipt of payment on nonaccrual financing receivables, interest income is recognized and accrual of interest is resumed once the account has been made current or the specific circumstances have been resolved.

As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the recorded investment in past due financing receivables on nonaccrual status was $0.3 and $0.6, respectively, and there were no recorded investments in finance receivables past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. The recorded investment in impaired notes receivable was $4.1 as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and was fully reserved and as of March 31, 2018 are all greater than 89 days past due.

The Company provides its global operations guarantees and standby letters of credit through various financial institutions for suppliers, customers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers. If the Company is not able to make payments or fulfill contractual obligations, the suppliers, customers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers may draw on the pertinent bank. At March 31, 2018, the maximum future payment obligations related to these various guarantees totaled $182.0, of which $28.0 represented standby letters of credit to insurance providers, and no associated liability was recorded. At December 31, 2017, the maximum future payment obligations relative to these various guarantees totaled $195.1, of which $28.0 represented standby letters of credit to insurance providers, and no associated liability was recorded.

The Company provides its customers a manufacturer’s warranty and records, at the time of the sale, a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs. Estimated future obligations due to warranty claims are based upon historical factors such as labor rates, average repair time, travel time, number of service calls per machine and cost of replacement parts. The decrease in the liability was primarily due to warranties expiring in Brazil.

During 2016, the Company launched a multi-year integration and transformation program, known as DN2020. The DN2020 plan focuses on the utilization of cost efficiencies and synergy opportunities that result from the transformational acquisition of Wincor Nixdorf AG (Diebold Nixdorf AG), which aligns employee activities with the Company's goal of delivering cost reductions of approximately $240 by the year 2020. The Company incurred restructuring charges of $3.8 and $12.9 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to DN2020. The Company anticipates additional restructuring costs of approximately $50 primarily related to severance anticipated for completion of the Company's integration and transformation plans throughout the three lines of business to be incurred through the end of DN2020.

Delta Program

At the beginning of the 2015, Diebold Nixdorf AG initiated the Delta Program related to restructuring and realignment. As part of a change process that has spanned several years, the Delta Program is designed to hasten the expansion of software and professional services operations and to further enhance profitability in the services business. This program includes expansion in the high-end fields of managed services and outsourcing. It also involves capacity adjustments on the hardware side, enabling the Company to respond more effectively to market volatility while maintaining its abilities with innovation. There were no charges during the periods presented. As of the date of the acquisition of Diebold Nixdorf AG, the restructuring accrual balance acquired was $45.5 and consisted of severance activities.

In connection with the Incremental Agreement, the interest rate with respect to the Term Loan B Facility - USD is based on, at the Company’s option, adjusted LIBOR plus 2.75 percent (with a floor of 0.00 percent) or Alternate Base Rate (ABR) plus 1.75 percent (with an ABR floor of 1.00 percent) and the interest rate with respect to the Term Loan B Facility - Euro is based on adjusted Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) plus 3.00 percent (with a floor of 0.00 percent).

The DPLTA offers the Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders, at their election, (i) the ability to put their Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary shares to Diebold KGaA in exchange for cash compensation of €55.02 per Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary share or (ii) to remain Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders and receive a recurring compensation in cash of €3.13 (€2.82 net under the current taxation regime) per Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary share for each full fiscal year of Diebold Nixdorf AG. The redemption value adjustment includes the updated cash compensation pursuant to the DPLTA. The Company paid $1.7 during the first quarter of 2017, along with a minimal impact in 2018, in cash compensation to redeem Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary shares in connection with the DPLTA. The ultimate timing and amount of any future cash payments related to the DPLTA are uncertain. 

The remaining balance relates to certain noncontrolling interests with redemption features, that include put rights that are not within the control of the issuer, which are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. The redeemable noncontrolling interests were recorded at fair value as by applying the income approach using unobservable inputs for projected cash flows, including but not limited, to net sales and operating profit, and a discount rate, which are considered Level 3 inputs. The results of operations for these redeemable noncontrolling interests were not significant. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the put rights are uncertain.

During 2017, the Company divested its legacy Diebold business in the U.K. to Cennox Group for $5.0, fulfilling the requirements previously set forth by the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The divestiture closed on June 30, 2017. As part of the Company's routine efforts to evaluate its business operations, during 2017, the Company divested its electronic security (ES) businesses located in Mexico and Chile in the second and third quarters of 2017, respectively. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.2 related to these transactions. The combined net sales of the divestitures represented less than one percent of total net sales of the Company for 2017.


The Company has qualified retirement plans covering certain U.S. employees that have been closed to new participants since 2003 and frozen since December 2013. Plans that cover salaried employees provide retirement benefits based on an employee’s compensation during the ten years before the date of the plan freeze or the date of the employee's actual separation from service, if earlier. The Company’s funding policy for salaried plans is to contribute annually based on actuarial projections and applicable regulations. Plans covering hourly employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service. The Company’s funding policy for hourly plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by applicable regulations.

The Company has non-qualified pension plans to provide supplemental retirement benefits to certain officers, which were also frozen since December 2013. Benefits are payable at retirement based upon a percentage of the participant’s compensation, as defined. In addition to providing retirement benefits, the Company provides post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits (referred to as other benefits) for certain retired employees. Retired eligible employees in the U.S. may be entitled to these benefits based upon years of service with the Company, age at retirement and collective bargaining agreements. There are no plan assets and the Company funds the benefits as the claims are paid. The post-retirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and life insurance plans together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates.

The Company also has defined benefit plans in Germany and Switzerland, among others. In Germany, post-employment benefit plans are set up as employer funded pension plans and deferred compensation plans. The employer funded pension commitments in Germany are based upon direct performance-related commitments in terms of defined contribution plans. Each beneficiary receives, depending on individual pay-scale grouping, contractual classification or income level, different yearly contributions. The contribution is multiplied by an age factor appropriate to the respective pension plan and credited to the individual retirement account of the employee. The retirement accounts may be used up at retirement by either a one-time lump-sum payout or payments of up to ten years. Insured events include disability, death and reaching of retirement age. In Switzerland, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The employees receive their pension payments as a function of contributions paid, a fixed interest rate and annuity factors. Insured events are disability, death and reaching of retirement age. 



Contributions

There have been no significant changes to the expected 2018 plan year contribution amounts previously disclosed. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, contributions of $22.6 and $6.9, respectively, were made to the qualified and non-qualified pension plans.

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business or financing activities. The Company’s derivative foreign currency instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and cash payments principally related to the Company’s non functional currency assets and liabilities. The Company's interest rate derivatives are used to manage the differences in amount due to variable rate interest rate borrowings.



As a result of the adoption of ASU 2017-12, $2.6 was included in net sales and $0.1 in cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 which would have been included in foreign exchange gain (loss), net in the prior period. 

Foreign Exchange

Net Investment Hedges The Company has international subsidiaries with net balance sheet positions that generate cumulative translation adjustments within AOCI. The Company uses derivatives to manage potential changes in value of its net investments. The Company uses the forward-to-forward method for its quarterly measurement of ineffectiveness assessments of hedge effectiveness. No ineffectiveness results if the notional amount of the derivative matches the portion of the net investment designated as being hedged because the Company uses derivative instruments with underlying exchange rates consistent with its functional currency and the functional currency of the hedged net investment. Changes in value that are deemed effective are accumulated in AOCI where they will remain until they are reclassified to income together with the gain or loss on the entire investment upon substantial liquidation of the subsidiary. The fair value of the Company’s net investment hedge contracts were $(0.1) and $2.0 as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The net loss recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge derivative instruments $0.9 and $3.0 in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

On August 15, 2016, the Company designated its €350.0 euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility as a net investment hedge of its investments in certain subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency in order to reduce volatility in stockholders' equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the euro with respect to the U.S. dollar. Effectiveness is assessed at least quarterly by confirming that the respective designated net investments' net equity balances at the beginning of any period collectively continues to equal or exceed the balance outstanding on the Company's euro-denominated term loan. Changes in value that are deemed effective are accumulated in AOCI. When the respective net investments are sold or substantially liquidated, the balance of the cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI will be reclassified into earnings. The net loss recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge foreign currency borrowings was $5.8 and $6.1 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. On March 30, 2017, the Company de-designated €130.6 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility and on May 9, 2017, the Company designated an additional €66.8 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility as a result of its repricing described under note 11. On September 21, 2017, the Company de-designated €100.0 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility. 

Non-Designated Hedges A substantial portion of the Company’s operations and revenues are international. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates can create substantial foreign exchange gains and losses from the revaluation of non-functional currency

FORM 10-Q as of March 31, 2018

 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)




Cash Flow Hedges The Company is exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies against its functional currency. At the Company, both sales and purchases are transacted in foreign currencies. The Company has certain subsidiaries with the euro (EUR) as its functional currency that are primarily exposed to the U.S. dollar (USD) and Great Britain pound sterling (GBP). This risk is considerably reduced by natural hedging (i.e. management of sales and purchases by choice location and suppliers). For the remainder of the risk that is not naturally hedged, foreign currency forwards are used to manage the exposure between EUR-GBP and EUR-USD.



Interest Rate

Cash Flow Hedges The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The Company has multiple pay-fixed receive-variable interest rate swaps outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $400.0.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. The fair value of the Company's interest rate contracts was $13.1 and $9.8 as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. The Company estimates that a minimal amount will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense over the next year.

The Company has an interest rate swap for a nominal sum of €50.0, which was entered into in May 2010 with a ten-year term from October 1, 2010 until September 30, 2020. This interest rate swap mitigated the interest rate risk associated with the European Investment Bank debt, which was paid in full during 2017. For this interest rate swap, the three-month EURIBOR is received and a fixed interest of 2.97 percent is paid. The fair value, which is measured at market prices, as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $(6.1) and $(5.5), respectively. The interest rate contract is not designated and changes in the fair value of non-designated interest rate swap agreements are recognized in miscellaneous, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized $0.5 and $0.3 in interest expense relating to the interest rate swap for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Additionally, the Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any additional derivatives that are not designated as hedges.

Contractual Obligation

At March 31, 2018, the Company had purchase commitments due within one year totaling $3.5 for materials and services through contract manufacturing agreements at negotiated prices. The Company guarantees a fixed cost of certain products used in production to its China strategic partners.

Indirect Tax Contingencies

The Company accrues non-income-tax liabilities for indirect tax matters when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. In the event any losses are sustained in excess of accruals, they are charged against income. In evaluating indirect tax matters, management takes into consideration factors such as historical experience with matters of similar nature, specific facts and circumstances, and the likelihood of prevailing. Management evaluates and updates accruals as matters progress over time. It is reasonably possible that some of the matters for which accruals have not been established could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require recognizing future expenditures. Also, statutes of limitations could expire without the Company paying the taxes for matters for which accruals have been established, which could result in the recognition of future gains upon reversal of these accruals at that time. 



In August 2012, one of the Company's Brazil subsidiaries was notified of a tax assessment of approximately R$270.0, including penalties and interest, regarding certain Brazil federal indirect taxes (Industrialized Products Tax, Import Tax, Programa de Integração Social and Contribution to Social Security Financing) for 2008 and 2009. The assessment alleges improper importation of certain components into Brazil's free trade zone that would nullify certain indirect tax incentives. On September 10, 2012, the Company filed its administrative defenses with the tax authorities.

In March 2017, the administrative proceedings concluded and the assessment was reduced approximately 95 percent to a total of R$17.3 including penalties and interest as of March 2017. The Company is pursuing its remedies in the judicial sphere and management continues to believe that it has valid legal positions. In addition, this matter could negatively impact Brazil federal indirect taxes in other years that remain open under statute. It is reasonably possible that the Company could be required to pay taxes, penalties and interest related to this matter, which could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had $4.9 accrued related to the Brazil indirect tax matter.

The Company has challenged the customs rulings in Thailand seeking to retroactively collect customs duties on previous imports of ATMs. Management believes that the customs authority’s attempt to retroactively assess customs duties is in contravention of World Trade Organization agreements and, accordingly, challenged the rulings. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company received a prospective ruling from the U.S. Customs Border Protection which is consistent with the Company's interpretation of the treaty in question. In August 2017, the Supreme Court of Thailand ruled in the Company's favor, finding that Customs' attempt to collect duties for importation of ATMs is improper. In addition, in August 2016 and February 2017, the tax court of appeals rendered decisions in favor of the Company related to more than half of the assessments at issue. The surviving matters remain at various stages of the appeals process and the Company will use the Supreme Court's decision in support of its position in those matters. Management remains confident that the Company has a valid legal position in these appeals. Accordingly, the Company does not have any amount accrued for this contingency.

A loss contingency is reasonably possible if it has a more than remote but less than probable chance of occurring. Although management believes the Company has valid defenses with respect to its indirect tax positions, it is reasonably possible that a loss could occur in excess of the estimated accrual. The Company estimated the aggregate risk at March 31, 2018 to be up to $144.6 for its material indirect tax matters, of which $25.8 and $27.0, respectively, primarily relates to the Brazil indirect tax matter and

 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)



Thailand customs matter disclosed above. The aggregate risk related to indirect taxes is adjusted as the applicable statutes of limitations expire.

Legal Contingencies

At March 31, 2018, the Company was a party to several lawsuits that were incurred in the normal course of business, which neither individually nor in the aggregate are considered material by management in relation to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. In management’s opinion, the Company's consolidated financial statements would not be materially affected by the outcome of these legal proceedings, commitments or asserted claims.


The Company's accounting policies derive segment results that are the same as those the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) regularly reviews and uses to make decisions, allocate resources and assess performance. The Company continually considers its operating structure and the information subject to regular review by its Chief Executive Officer, who is the CODM, to identify reportable operating segments. The Company’s operating structure is based on a number of factors that management uses to evaluate, view and run its business operations, which currently includes, but is not limited to, product, service and solution. The Company measures the performance of each segment based on several metrics, including net sales and segment operating profit. The CODM uses these results to make decisions, allocate resources and assess performance by LOB.

Segment revenue represents revenues from sales to external customers. Segment operating profit is defined as revenues less expenses identifiable to those segments. The Company does not allocate to its segments certain operating expenses, which it manages at the corporate level; that are not routinely used in the management of the segments; or information that is impractical to report. These unallocated costs include certain corporate costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and deferred revenue, restructuring charges, impairment charges, legal, indemnification, and professional fees related to acquisition and divestiture expenses, along with other income (expenses). Segment operating profit reconciles to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes by deducting corporate costs and other income or expense items that are not attributed to the segments. Assets are not allocated to segments, and thus are not included in the assessment of segment performance, and consequently, we do not disclose total assets and depreciation and amortization expense by reportable operating segment.

For additional information related to the Company's revenue sources, refer to note 2. In addition to the considerations mentioned above regarding the CODM, the Company has assessed several factors in disaggregating revenue which include the information disclosed in this report and other disaggregated revenue information provided in investor presentations and board of director presentations.

Gross Profit



Services and software gross margin was lower due to software margin declines across AP and EMEA from a higher volume of lower margin business and increased professional services costs. Services margin was adversely impacted by lower margin in the Americas and AP from lower margin services business in China.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations as of March 31, 2018

DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES



Systems gross margin in the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased primarily as a result of higher purchase accounting adjustments in the prior year of $14.5 and the current year benefit from Brazil indirect tax accrual reversal of $3.7. Deferred Revenue Adjustments included a $5.2 prior year reduction of revenue and $9.3 higher asset amortization.

Operating Expenses




Selling and administrative expense in the three months ended March 31, 2018, decreased $19.1 primarily from cost reduction initiatives as well as lower non-routine charges of $10.6 and restructuring of $7.1. These decreases were partially offset by an unfavorable currency impact of $21.2.

Non-routine costs in selling and administrative expense of $38.5 and $49.1 were included in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The primary components of the non-routine expenses in the first quarter 2018 pertained to purchase accounting adjustments of $23.8 related to intangible asset amortization and integration costs totaling $14.2. Selling and administrative expense included restructuring charges of $1.3 and $8.4 in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Research, development and engineering expense in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was flat including an unfavorable currency impact of $4.0. Excluding the impact of currency, research, development and engineering expense decreased primarily from lower restructuring and non-routine integration cost as well as lower software research, development and engineering expense. 

In the three months ended March 31, 2018, the gain on sale of assets was primarily related to the sale of a building in North America of $4.5 and the liquidation of the Barbados operating entity of $3.3. 

Operating expense as a percent of net sales in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 24.6 percent compared with 26.4 percent in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease is related primarily to lower restructuring and non-routine expense inclusive of the previously mentioned gain on sale of a building in North America.

Operating Profit



The operating loss decreased in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due primarily from decreased operating expenses as a result of lower non-routine and restructuring charges.

Other Income (Expense)



The decrease in interest income in the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, was the result of lower average balances and reduced current period rates of short-term investments in Brazil. Interest expense was lower in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same prior-year period due to the favorable impact of refinancing the debt related to the Acquisition. Foreign exchange loss in the three-month period was primarily due to the strengthening of the euro compared to the prior year period.

Net Income (Loss)



Net loss was $63.3 and $52.2 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to the reasons described above and the change in income tax (benefit) expense.

The effective tax rate on the net loss was (44.2) percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The tax expense on the loss is due primarily from impacts of the Tax Act, more specifically, impacts related to GILTI on the estimated annual tax rate. The effective tax rate could vary in future periods based on the Company's earnings before taxes and clarifications around the Tax Act.

The effective tax rate on the net loss was 30.2 percent for the three months ended 2017. Companies are required to apply their estimated annual tax rate on a year-to-date basis in each interim period. Companies should not apply the estimated annual tax rate to interim financial results if the estimated annual tax rate is not reliably predictable. In this situation, the interim tax rate should be based on the actual year-to-date results. As of March, 31, 2017, the Company was not able to reasonably estimate the annual effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2017, because small fluctuations in the Company's earnings before taxes could have resulted in a material change in the estimated annual tax rate. For this reason, the Company did not believe the estimated annual tax rate would provide a reliable estimate and as a result, the Company computed the interim tax rate based on the actual year-to-date results. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily a result of the jurisdictional income (loss) mix and varying statutory rates in the Company's global footprint.

Segment Net Sales and Operating Profit Summary



In the three months ended March 31, 2018, services net sales increased $19.0 or 3.3 percent and included a net favorable currency impact of $39.9 and Deferred Revenue Adjustments of $5.2. Excluding currency and Deferred Revenue Adjustments, net sales decreased $26.1 attributable to lower installation revenue tied to decreased banking systems volumes in the Americas and EMEA.

Segment operating profit decreased $7.4 due to lower gross profit corresponding with systems volume declines in the Americas as a result of lower volume and supply chain delays. Additionally, services operating profit was favorably impacted by higher gross profit on maintenance revenue from increased retail systems volume across all regions while total operating expense was flat between years.


In the three months ended March 31, 2018, software net sales increased $9.1 or 8.2 percent including a net favorable currency impact of $10.2. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales decreased $1.1 primarily related to lower systems volumes in EMEA and AP. This was partially offset by higher banking project volume in the Americas.

Segment operating profit increased $2.1 in the three months ended March 31, 2018 due primarily to lower research, development and engineering expenses. Lower research, development and engineering expense was attributable to higher capitalization of software development and cost reduction initiatives. 


In the three months ended March 31, 2018, systems net sales decreased $66.7 or 15.9 percent, including a net favorable currency impact of $38.5 and Deferred Revenue Adjustments of $5.2. Excluding currency and Deferred Revenue Adjustments, net sales decreased $110.4 from lower combined systems solutions across the Company. EMEA was adversely impacted by lower volume throughout the region and in the Americas, lower volume was a function of supply chain delays. Additionally, AP was adversely impacted by lower volume as previously mentioned in the geographic regions section.

Segment operating loss decreased $21.6 in the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily due to lower gross profit as a function of lower banking systems volume, specifically in the Americas from supply chain delays as well as AP. Operating expenses increased

from higher research, development and engineering expenses associated with new product development and higher associate related cost.

Liquidity and Capital Resources






Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring and integration activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.

Net cash used by operating activities was $142.3 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase in use of $76.0 from $66.3 for the same period in 2017.

convert to cash within the year. Accounts payable cash use improved primarily related to reduced spending in EMEA and the Americas.


The most significant changes in adjustments to net income includes increased depreciation and amortization expense and additional share-based compensation. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $8.5 to $67.1 during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $58.6 during the same period in 2017 primarily due to incremental intangible assets amortization expense related to the finalization of purchase accounting. Share-based compensation increased $6.9 to $13.7 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily due to a change in non-substantive vesting terms of certain awards and an increased number of unvested awards granted. Adjustments to net income also includes (gain) loss on sale of assets, net, which consists primarily of the gains from the sale of a building in North America.

Investing Activities

Net cash provided by investing activities was $39.1 and a use of $29.0 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The maturities and purchases of investments primarily relate to short-term investment activity in Brazil. The proceeds from the sale of assets primarily include cash from the sale of a building in North America. The $68.1 change was primarily due to the utilization of short-term investments in Brazil for cash needs across the organization.

Financing Activities

Net cash used by financing activities was $91.4 and $72.5 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $18.9. The change was primarily due to an additional $35.8 in debt repayments, net of borrowings primarily related to payment of the Revolving Facility and lower cash distributions of $15.2 to noncontrolling interests primarily related to Diebold Nixdorf AG which was paid in March 2017. Refer to note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for details of the Company's cash flows related to debt borrowings and repayments.

Debt As of March 31, 2018, the Company had various international short-term uncommitted lines of credit with borrowing limits of $213.2. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings on the short-term uncommitted lines of credit as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was 9.16 percent and 9.17 percent, respectively. Short-term uncommitted lines mature in less than one year. The amount available under the short-term uncommitted lines at March 31, 2018 was $193.9.

The Credit Agreement includes the Revolving Facility in the amount of up to $520.0 and the Term Loan A Facility in the amount of up to $230.0. On December 23, 2020, the Term Loan A Facility will mature and the Revolving Facility will automatically terminate. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding Revolving Facility borrowings as of December 31, 2017 was 3.63 percent which is variable based on the LIBOR. The amount available under the Revolving Facility as of March 31, 2018 was $520.0.

The Company has $400.0 aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Notes which are and will be guaranteed by certain of the Company’s existing and future domestic subsidiaries and expire in 2024.

On May 9, 2017, the Company entered into the Incremental Agreement which reduced the initial Term Loan B Facility of a $1,000.0 U.S. dollar-denominated tranche to $475.0. The reduction was funded using the $250.0 proceeds drawn from the Delayed Draw Term Loan A Facility, a replacement of $70.0 with Term Loan B Facility - Euro and previous principal payments.

In connection with the Incremental Agreement, the interest rate with respect to the Term Loan B Facility - USD is based on, at the Company’s option, adjusted LIBOR plus 2.75 percent (with a floor of 0.00 percent) or ABR plus 1.75 percent (with an ABR floor of 1.00 percent) and the interest rate with respect to the Term Loan B Facility - Euro is based on adjusted EURIBOR plus 3.00 percent (with a floor of 0.00 percent).

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various arrangements not recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets that have or could have an effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. The principal off-balance sheet arrangements that the Company enters into are guarantees, operating leases and sales of finance receivables. The Company provides its global operations guarantees and standby letters of credit through various financial institutions to suppliers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers. If the Company is not able to make payment, the suppliers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers may draw on the pertinent bank. Refer to note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details of guarantees. The Company has sold finance receivables to financial institutions while continuing to service the receivables. The Company records these sales by removing finance receivables from the condensed consolidated balance sheets and recording gains and losses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include revenue recognition, the valuation of trade, finance lease receivables, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, guarantee obligations and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, pension and post-retirement benefits and customer incentives, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors. Management monitors the economic conditions and other factors and will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 

Management believes there have been no significant changes during the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the items that the Company disclosed as its critical accounting policies and estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

On August 15, 2016, the Company designated its €350.0 euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility as a net investment hedge of its investments in certain subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency in order to reduce volatility in stockholders' equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the euro with respect to the U.S. dollar. Effectiveness is assessed at least quarterly by confirming that the respective designated net investments' net equity balances at the beginning of any period collectively continues to equal or exceed the balance outstanding on the Company's euro-denominated term loan. Changes in value that are deemed effective are accumulated in AOCI. When the respective net investments are sold or substantially liquidated, the balance of the cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI will be reclassified into earnings. The net gain (loss) recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge foreign currency borrowings was $(5.8) and $(6.1) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. On March 30, 2017, the Company de-designated €130.6 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility and on May 9, 2017, the Company designated an additional €66.8 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility as a result of its repricing described under note 11. On September 21, 2017, the Company de-designated €100.0 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility.
