FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and any exhibits to this Report contain “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “expect”, “intend”, “will”, “should” and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect management’s current beliefs, assumptions and expectations and are subject to a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially. Such factors include but are not limited to: our ability to address our business challenges in order to reverse revenue declines, reduce costs and increase productivity so that we can invest in and grow our business; changes in economic and political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements and tax laws in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; our ability to successfully develop new products, technologies and service offerings and to protect our intellectual property rights; the risk that multi-year contracts with governmental entities could be terminated prior to the end of the contract term and that civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could be imposed on us if we fail to comply with the terms of such contracts and applicable law; the risk that partners, subcontractors and software vendors will not perform in a timely, quality manner; actions of competitors and our ability to promptly and effectively react to changing technologies and customer expectations; our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to maintain and improve cost efficiency of operations, including savings from restructuring actions; the risk that individually identifiable information of customers, clients and employees could be inadvertently disclosed or disclosed as a result of a breach of our security systems; reliance on third parties, including subcontractors, for manufacturing of products and provision of services; our ability to manage changes in the printing environment and expand equipment placements; interest rates, cost of borrowing and access to credit markets; funding requirements associated with our employee pension and retiree health benefit plans; the risk that our operations and products may not comply with applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, particularly environmental regulations and directives and anti-corruption laws; the outcome of litigation and regulatory proceedings to which we may be a party; the outcome of our process to evaluate all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including terminating or restructuring Xerox's relationship with FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation ("Fujifilm"); international trade policies and their impact on the cost of and demand for our products and our competitive position, including the imposition of new tariffs or changes in existing tariff rates; and other factors that are set forth in the “Risk Factors” section, the “Legal Proceedings” section, the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 and our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Xerox assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments, except as required by law.

Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. (“Fuji Xerox”) is a joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm in which Xerox holds a noncontrolling 25% equity interest and Fujifilm holds the remaining equity interest. Given our status as a minority investor, we have limited contractual and other rights to information with respect to Fuji Xerox matters. In April 2017, Fujifilm formed an independent investigation committee (the “IIC”) to primarily conduct a review of the appropriateness of the accounting practices at Fuji Xerox’s New Zealand subsidiary and at other subsidiaries. The IIC completed its review during the second quarter 2017 and identified aggregate adjustments to Fuji Xerox’s financial statements of approximately JPY 40 billion (approximately $360 million) primarily related to misstatements at Fuji Xerox’s New Zealand and Australian subsidiaries. We determined that our share of the total adjustments identified as part of the investigation was approximately $90 million and impacted our fiscal years 2009 through 2017. We revised our previously issued annual and interim consolidated financial statements for 2014, 2015 and 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. Fujifilm and Fuji Xerox continue to review Fujifilm’s oversight and governance of Fuji Xerox as well as Fuji Xerox’s oversight and governance over its businesses in light of the findings of the IIC. 

In 2018, in connection with the completion of audits of Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year-end financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, as well as the review of Fuji Xerox’s unaudited interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, additional adjustments and misstatements were identified. These additional adjustments and misstatements were to the Net income of Fuji Xerox for the period from 2010 through 2017 previously revised for the items identified by the IIC noted above. At this time, we can provide no assurances relative to the outcome of any potential governmental investigations or any consequences thereof that may happen as a result of this matter.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)


Note 1 – Basis of Presentation

References herein to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “company” and “Xerox” refer to Xerox Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context suggests otherwise.

We have prepared the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the accounting policies described in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K ("2017 Annual Report") except as noted herein, and the interim reporting requirements of Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in our annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. You should read these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2017 Annual Report.

In our opinion, all adjustments, which are necessary for a fair statement of financial position, operating results and cash flows for the interim periods presented, have been made. These adjustments consist of normal recurring items. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results of the full year.

For convenience and ease of reference, we refer to the financial statement caption “Income before Income Taxes and Equity Income” as “pre-tax income.” 

In third quarter 2018, we determined that the Pension Benefit Obligation (PBO) for our UK funded pension plan at December 31, 2017 was overstated by approximately GBP 40 million (approximately USD $53 or $43 after-tax). The error was the result of the plan administrator under reporting benefit payments. The correction of the PBO was recorded as an out-of-period adjustment in the third quarter 2018 with the offset to the balance sheet recorded as a credit to Changes in defined benefit plans, net in Other comprehensive income for the period. We assessed the impact of this error and concluded that it was not material to the financial statements previously issued for any interim or annual period and the correction of the error in the third quarter 2018 is not expected to be material to the annual financial statements for 2018.

Note 2 – Adoption of New Revenue Recognition Standard


On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606), which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASC Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASC Topic 606 defines a five-step process to recognize revenue and requires more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process than required under previous U.S. GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. 

We adopted this standard using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Under ASC Topic 606, based on the nature of our contracts and consistent with prior practice, we recognize revenue upon invoicing the customer for the large majority of our revenue. Additionally, the unit of accounting, that is, the identification of performance obligations, is consistent with prior revenue recognition practice. Accordingly, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact for the large majority of our revenues. Lastly, a significant portion of our Equipment sales are either recorded as sales-type leases or through direct sales to distributors and resellers and these revenue streams are not impacted by the adoption of ASC Topic 606. The only change of significance identified in our adoption involves a change in the classification of certain revenues that were previously reported in Services revenues. These revenues relate to certain analyst services performed in connection with the installation of equipment that are being considered part of the equipment sale performance obligation in 2018. Accordingly, in 2018 these revenues are now reported as part of Sales. As a result of this change, $8 and $25 of revenue was recorded, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as Sales, which would have been previously recorded as Services revenue in prior periods. 

Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

Another change identified upon adoption was with respect to deferred contract costs, which include incremental costs of obtaining a contract and costs to fulfill a contract. Deferred contract costs had been minimal under our prior practices as most costs to obtain a contract and fulfill a contract were expensed as incurred. However, as a result of the contract cost guidance included in ASC Topic 606 and ASC Topic 340-40 "Contracts with Customers", upon adoption, we recorded a transition asset of $153, and a net of tax increase of $117 to Retained earnings, related to the incremental cost to obtain contracts. Substantially all of this adjustment is related to the deferral of sales commissions paid to sales people and agents in connection with the placement of equipment with post sale service arrangements.






We generate revenue through the sale of equipment, supplies and maintenance and printing services. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer or in the period the customer benefits from the service. With the exception of our sales-type lease arrangements, our invoices to the customer, which normally have short-term payment terms, are typically aligned to the transfer of goods or as services are rendered to our customers and therefore in most cases we recognize revenue based on our right to invoice customers. As a result of the application of this practical expedient for the substantial portion of our revenue, the disclosure of the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for our services is not required.

Significant judgments primarily include the identification of performance obligations in our Document management services arrangements as well the pattern of delivery for those services. 





Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

Our services contracts may also include the sale or lease of equipment and software. In these instances, we follow the policies noted for Equipment or Software Revenues and separately report the revenue associated with these performance obligations. Certain document management services arrangements may also include an embedded lease of equipment. In these instances, the revenues associated with the lease are recognized in accordance with the requirements for lease accounting. 


Distributors and resellers participate in various rebate, price-protection, cooperative marketing and other programs, and we estimate the variable consideration associated with these programs and record those amounts as a reduction to revenue when the sales occur. Similarly, we account for our estimates of sales returns and other allowances when the sales occur based on our historical experience.

In certain instances, we may provide lease financing to end-user customers who purchased equipment we sold to distributors or resellers. We are not obligated to provide financing and we compete with other third-party leasing companies with respect to the lease financing provided to these end-user customers.


Revenues under bundled arrangements are allocated considering the relative standalone selling prices of the lease and non-lease deliverables included in the bundled arrangement. Lease deliverables include the equipment, financing, maintenance and other executory costs, while non-lease deliverables generally consist of the supplies and non-maintenance services. The allocation for the lease deliverables begins by allocating revenues to the maintenance and other executory costs plus a profit thereon. These elements are generally recognized over the term of the lease as service revenue. The remaining amounts are allocated to the equipment and financing elements, which are subjected to the accounting estimates noted below under “Leases”.


We consider the economic life of most of our products to be five years, since this represents the most frequent contractual lease term for our principal products and only a small percentage of our leases are for original terms longer than five years. There is no significant after-market for our used equipment. We believe five years is representative of the period during which the equipment is expected to be economically usable, with normal service, for the purpose for which it is intended. Residual values are not significant.

With respect to fair value, we perform an analysis of equipment fair value based on cash selling prices during the applicable period. The cash selling prices are compared to the range of values determined for our leases. The range of cash selling prices must be reasonably consistent with the lease selling prices in order for us to determine that such lease prices are indicative of fair value.

Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

Our lease pricing interest rates, which are used in determining customer payments in a bundled lease arrangement, are developed based upon a variety of factors including local prevailing rates in the marketplace and the customer’s credit history, industry and credit class. We reassess our pricing interest rates quarterly based on changes in the local prevailing rates in the marketplace. These interest rates have generally been adjusted if the rates vary by 25 basis points or more, cumulatively, from the rate last in effect. The pricing interest rates generally equal the implicit rates within the leases, as corroborated by our comparisons of cash to lease selling prices.












Other Revenue Recognition Policies

Table of Contents 


For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract of $22 and $62, respectively, were deferred and the related amortization was $24 and $72, respectively. The balance of deferred incremental direct costs net of accumulated amortization at September 30, 2018 was $174. This amount is expected to be amortized over its estimated period of benefit, which we currently estimate to be approximately four years. 

We may also incur costs associated with our services arrangements to generate or enhance resources and assets that will be used to satisfy our future performance obligations included in these arrangements. These costs are considered contract fulfillment costs. These costs are amortized over the contractual service period of the arrangement to cost of services. In addition, we also provide inducements to certain customers in various forms, including contractual credits, which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract. Amounts deferred associated with contract fulfillment costs and inducements were $10 at September 30, 2018.

Equipment and software used in the fulfillment of service arrangements and where the Company retains control are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of their useful life or the term of the contract if an asset is contract specific.



Note 3 – Recent Accounting Pronouncements


Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, with additional amendments being issued in 2018. This update requires the recognition of right-to-use assets and lease obligations by lessees for those leases currently classified as operating leases under existing lease guidance. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. Short term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not required to be recognized. The update also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosure of key information regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements to increase transparency and comparability among companies. 

The accounting for lessors does not fundamentally change with this update except for changes to conform and align guidance to the lessee guidance as well as to the new revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09. Some of these conforming changes such as those related to the definition of minimum lease payments, may potentially result in certain lease arrangements, which are currently accounted for as operating leases, being classified and accounted for as sales-type leases with a corresponding up-front recognition of equipment sales revenue. 

This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019 and certain practical expedients can be elected upon adoption. On the Lessee side, a cross-functional implementation team has been established which is evaluating the lease portfolio, system, process and policy change requirements. The Company has made progress in gathering the necessary data elements for the lease population and a system provider has been selected, with system configuration and implementation underway. The company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial results and expects it will have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position primarily related to the recognition of previously off-book operating leases. The Company is currently planning to elect the package of practical expedients to not reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs and is evaluating the other practical expedients available under the guidance. On the Lessor side, the Company continues to assess the potential impacts of the guidance on its lease agreements with customers, including potential changes in contracting terms, and we also expect to elect the package of practical expedients. 

The aggregate undiscounted value of our operating lease commitments at December 31, 2017 was approximately $450 and was primarily related to leases of facilities.

Table of Contents 

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses and Derivatives

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets. The update impacts financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through Net income. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.


Intangibles - Internal-Use Software 

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract. This update aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). The update provides criteria for determining which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense. The capitalized implementation costs are required to be expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement. The update also clarifies the presentation requirements for reporting such costs in the entity’s financial statements. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2018-15 on our consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes



Cash Flows

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This update provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues where current guidance is either unclear or does not include specific requirements. We adopted ASU 2016-15 effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018. This update includes specific guidance, that requires cash collected on beneficial interests received in a sale of receivables be classified as inflows from investing activities. Formerly, those collections were reported in operating cash flows. We reported $60 and $170 of collections on beneficial interests as operating cash inflows on the Statement of Cash Flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. Since the update is required to be applied retrospectively, our reported 2017 operating and investing cash flows were revised accordingly in 2018 to report this amount as investing cash flows. There is no expected impact to our 2018 cash flows from this reporting change, due to the termination of all accounts receivable sales arrangements in North America and all but one arrangement in Europe and the final repurchase of previously sold finance receivables during the fourth quarter of 2017. The other seven issues noted in this update did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

Additionally, in November 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash. The update requires that amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. We adopted ASU 2016-18 effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018 and applied it retrospectively through a revision of previously reported amounts. We held $61 and $75 of restricted cash, currently reported in Other current or long-term assets at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The changes in our restricted cash balances were primarily related to our accounts receivable sales programs, which were terminated during the fourth quarter of 2017. Accordingly, this update did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 5 - Supplementary Financial Information for additional information.

Income Taxes

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory. This update requires recognition of the income-tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Under current GAAP, recognition of the income tax consequences for asset transfers other than inventory could not be recognized until the asset was sold to a third party. We adopted ASU 2016-16 effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have nor is it expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 


During the fourth quarter 2017, we recorded an estimated non-cash charge of $400 reflecting our provisional estimated impact associated with the provisions of the Tax Act based on currently available information. During third quarter 2018, we adjusted our provisional estimate by an additional charge of $95 reflecting certain positions taken on our recently filed 2017 income tax return as well as consideration of additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The adjustment includes changes to the determination of the one-time deemed repatriation tax as well as additional re-measurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower enacted statutory tax rate. The total charge of $495 related to the Tax Act remains a provisional estimate as we continue to evaluate and consider additional impacts including those related to interpretive guidance from the U.S. Treasury and IRS as well as filing positions we may take on our 2018 U.S. Tax Return. Accordingly, additional adjustments, possibly material, may be recorded in the fourth quarter 2018 as we finalize our estimate related to the Tax Act. Any adjustments to this provisional amount will be reported as a component of Income tax expense.

Note 6 – Accounts Receivable, Net



Amounts to be invoiced in the subsequent quarter for current services provided are included in amounts accrued.

We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is determined principally on the basis of past collection experience as well as consideration of current economic conditions and changes in our customer collection trends. 

Accounts Receivable Sales Arrangements 

Accounts receivable sales arrangements are utilized in the normal course of business as part of our cash and liquidity management. The accounts receivable sold are generally short-term trade receivables with payment due dates of less than 60 days. During the fourth quarter 2017, we terminated all accounts receivable sales arrangements in North America and all but one arrangement in Europe. The remaining facility in Europe enables us to sell accounts receivable associated with our distributor network on an ongoing basis, without recourse. Under this arrangement, we sell our entire interest in the related accounts receivable for cash and no portion of the payment is held back or deferred by the purchaser.

Of the accounts receivable sold and derecognized from our balance sheet, $98 and $161 remained uncollected as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

Note 9 – Investment in Affiliates, at Equity



Fuji Xerox

Equity in net income (loss) of Fuji Xerox is affected by certain adjustments required to reflect the deferral of profit associated with intercompany sales. These adjustments may result in recorded equity income (loss) that is different from that implied by our 25% ownership interest. In addition, the Equity in net income (loss) of Fuji Xerox for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 includes after-tax restructuring and other charges of $7 and $90, respectively. 

In 2018, in connection with the completion of the audits of Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year-end financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, as well the review of Fuji Xerox’s unaudited interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, out-of-period adjustments and misstatements were identified. These adjustments and misstatements were to the previously reported Net income of Fuji Xerox for the period from 2010 through 2017 and were incremental to the items that had been identified by the IIC (or Fujifilm's independent investigation committee completed in June 2017). These incremental adjustments primarily relate to Fuji Xerox’s Asia Pacific subsidiaries and involve improper revenue recognition, including revenue associated with leasing transactions, additional provisions for bad debt allowances and other asset impairments. In certain instances, some of the adjustments related to inappropriate accounting and reporting practices in the Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific subsidiaries where previous misstatements were identified.

Summary of Derivative Instruments Fair Value



Summary of Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)

Derivative gains (losses) affect the income statement based on whether such derivatives are designated as hedges of underlying exposures. The following is a summary of derivative gains (losses).

Designated Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)



During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, no amount of ineffectiveness was recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for these designated cash flow hedges and all components of each derivative’s gain or (loss) were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. In addition, no amount was recorded for an underlying exposure that did not occur or was not expected to occur.

As of September 30, 2018, a net after-tax loss of $7 was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with our cash flow hedging activity. The entire balance is expected to be reclassified into Net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions.

Non-Designated Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)

Non-designated derivative instruments are primarily instruments used to hedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. They are not designated as hedges since there is a natural offset for the re-measurement of the underlying foreign currency-denominated asset or liability.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 currency losses, net were $3 and $2, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 currency losses, net were $0 and $4, respectively. Net currency gains and losses include the mark-to-market adjustments of the derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and the related cost of those derivatives as well as the re-measurement of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and are included in Other expenses, net.

Note 13 – Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

The following table represents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The basis for the measurement at fair value in all cases is Level 2 – Significant Other Observable Inputs. 


We utilize the income approach to measure the fair value for our derivative assets and liabilities. The income approach uses pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves, currency exchange rates and forward prices, and therefore are classified as Level 2.

Fair value for our deferred compensation plan investments in mutual funds is based on quoted market prices for those funds. Fair value for deferred compensation plan liabilities is based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment selections.

Summary of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities 



The fair value amounts for Cash and cash equivalents and Accounts receivable, net, approximate carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair value of Short-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, and Long-term debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to us for debt of similar maturities (Level 2). The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at such date.

Plan Amendment

Retiree Health Plan 

In October 2018, we amended our U.S. Retiree Health Plan effective January 1 2019, to reduce certain benefits for existing non-union retirees through the reduction or elimination of coverage or cost-sharing subsidies for retiree health care and life insurance costs. This negative plan amendment is expected to result in a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of approximately $280, which consists of approximately $215 for the plan amendment and an actuarial gain of approximately $65 related to the required plan remeasurement upon amendment. The amount for the plan amendment is expected to be amortized to future net periodic benefit costs as a prior service credit and is expected to reduce 2019 costs by approximately $70 (approximately $15 for the fourth quarter of 2018). The plan amendment is also expected to reduce 2019 cash contributions from Xerox by approximately $20.

Contributions 

The following table summarizes cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans. 


There are no mandatory contributions required in 2018 for our U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit plans to meet the minimum funding requirements, and our estimated 2018 contributions no longer include $50 of voluntary contributions to these plans.

Note 15 – Stock-Based Compensation





The following is a summary of changes to our program design and performance metrics effective for our April 2018 grant and grants thereafter under our new program, as approved by our board of directors (the "Board"). The Board also approved a change in the timing of our annual grant of awards from July to April, to better align our grant date with other annual incentive compensation payments and the underlying performance period related to PSs. We grant RSUs and PSs to officers, selected executives and middle managers, and SOs to officers and selected executives only.

Performance Shares


Performance-Based Component

PSs vest contingent upon meeting pre-determined cumulative goals for revenue and free cash flow. The fair value of the performance-based component of our PSs is based upon the grant-date market price. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on management's estimate of the number of shares expected to vest. If the cumulative three-year actual results exceed the stated targets, all plan participants have the potential to earn additional shares of common stock up to a maximum overachievement of 100% of the original grant. If the stated targets are not met, any recognized compensation cost would be reversed. Shares granted through September 30, 2018 under our new program were 693, with a corresponding weighted average grant date fair value of $27.88 per share.

As a result of the change in management in the second quarter 2018, the Board is currently reviewing this plan and has not finalized the performance measures and corresponding weightings and therefore the plan remains discretionary as of the third quarter 2018. Since final performance measures have not been approved as of September 30, 2018, the criteria needed to establish a grant date has not been met and therefore the fair value of the April 2018 grant will continue to be revalued based on the period end stock price for each subsequent reporting period until the grant date criteria has been met.

Note 19 – Contingencies and Litigation

Legal Matters


Brazil Tax and Labor Contingencies

Our Brazilian operations are involved in various litigation matters and have received or been the subject of numerous governmental assessments related to indirect and other taxes, as well as disputes associated with former employees and contract labor. The tax matters, which comprise a significant portion of the total contingencies, principally relate to claims for taxes on the internal transfer of inventory, municipal service taxes on rentals and gross revenue taxes. We are disputing these tax matters and intend to vigorously defend our positions. Based on the opinion of legal counsel and current reserves for those matters deemed probable of loss, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The labor matters principally relate to claims made by former employees and contract labor for the equivalent payment of all social security and other related labor benefits, as well as consequential tax claims, as if they were regular employees. As of September 30, 2018, the total amounts related to the unreserved portion of the tax and labor contingencies, inclusive of any related interest, amounted to approximately $490, with the decrease from our December 31, 2017 balance of approximately $600, primarily related to currency and closed cases, partially offset by interest. With respect to the unreserved balance of approximately $490, the majority has been assessed by management as being remote as to the likelihood of ultimately resulting in a loss to the Company. In connection with the above proceedings, customary local regulations may require us to make escrow cash deposits or post other security of up to half of the total amount in dispute. As of September 30, 2018, we had $59 of escrow cash deposits for matters we are disputing and additional surety bonds and letters of credit of $87 and $108, respectively, which include associated indexation. There were no liens on any of our Brazilian assets as of September 30, 2018. Generally, any escrowed amounts would be refundable and any liens would be removed to the extent the matters are resolved in our favor. We routinely assess all these matters as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability against our Brazilian operations and record our best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where we assess the likelihood of an ultimate loss as probable.

Litigation Against the Company




Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

Another complaint filed by Darwin Deason, a Xerox shareholder, against Xerox and its directors in the same Court on March 2, 2018 alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by refusing Mr. Deason’s request for a waiver of the deadline for nomination of a new slate of Xerox directors, and sought to enjoin Xerox and its directors from enforcing Xerox’s advance notice by-laws, thereby allowing Mr. Deason to proceed with the nominations, as well as costs, fees, and other relief.

On April 27, 2018, the Court issued decisions and orders granting plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions, which (i) enjoin Xerox from “taking any further action to consummate the change of control transaction between Xerox and Fuji that was announced on January 31, 2018 pending a final determination of the claims asserted in the underlying action;” (ii) enjoin Xerox from enforcing its advance notice bylaw provision requiring shareholders to nominate directors for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting by December 11, 2017; and (iii) require Xerox to waive such advance notice bylaw provision to permit the noticing of a slate of director nominees for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting, and denying defendants’ motions to dismiss.

On May 1, 2018, Xerox entered into a Director Appointment, Nomination and Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, among others, that would have resolved the pending proxy contest in connection with Xerox’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, as well as the ongoing litigation brought by Mr. Deason against Xerox and its directors related to the Fuji Transaction. The agreement expired by its terms on May 3, 2018 without becoming effective.

On May 7, 2018, defendants filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department, notices of appeal of, and motions to stay pending appeal, the lower Court’s decision and order. Defendants also moved the appellate court for interim relief ordering that the appeal be heard on an expedited basis. At a hearing before the appellate court on May 7, 2018, the appellate court ruled that the appeals would be heard on an expedited basis and granted a partial interim stay allowing Xerox and Fujifilm to take steps to seek regulatory approvals related to the Fuji Transaction pending a ruling from the appellate court on defendants’ motions to stay pending appeal.

On May 13, 2018, a settlement agreement with respect to the Deason cases was signed on behalf of plaintiff Deason, the Icahn Group and related parties, and all defendants except Fujifilm, and a memorandum of understanding regarding settlement of the putative class case was signed by all defendants except Fujifilm. Pursuant to the settlements, the settling defendants withdrew their appeal and motion to stay in the Deason cases. The settling defendants also withdrew their motion to stay in the putative class case. Fujifilm's appeal and motion for a stay of the proceedings in the first Deason case and the putative class case remain pending before the Appellate Division. The Court entered a stipulation of discontinuance as to the settling parties in the second Deason case on May 14, 2018, and agreed on June 22, 2018 to do the same in the first Deason case. 

On June 14, 2018, Fujifilm filed answers in the first Deason case and the putative class case, along with cross-claims against the members of the Xerox Board (as constituted before May 13, 2018) and a third-party complaint against Xerox director Jonathan Christodoro, seeking contribution for any potential award against Fujifilm for aiding and abetting purported breaches of fiduciary duties.

On June 19, 2018, the putative class plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of a stipulation of settlement that would resolve the claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the putative class case against all defendants, other than Fujifilm. Carmen Ribbe, the plaintiff in the below derivative action, and Fujifilm filed oppositions to the motion on July 10, 2018. 

On June 22, 2018, the Court entered an order denying a joint motion by the putative class plaintiffs and the settling defendants to dissolve the injunction in the class case as against the settling defendants, and entered an order denying Fujifilm’s motion to dissolve the injunctions in the class case and the first Deason case in their entirety.

On July 16, 2018, the Court held a hearing concerning the putative class plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval of the settlement in the putative class case. The Court indicated that it was not inclined to consider motions for approval of the settlement prior to considering whether the putative class should be certified.

On August 2, 2018, the Appellate Division entered orders recognizing the Xerox defendants’ withdrawal of their appeal in the Deason cases and denying all appellants’ motions to stay pending determination of appeals in the Deason and class cases.

On August 2, 2018, the Appellate Division entered orders (i) at their request, deeming withdrawn the Xerox defendants’ appeal and motion to stay in the Deason cases; and (ii) upon their request, deeming withdrawn the Xerox defendants’ motion to stay, pending determination of appeal, the putative class case; and (iii) denying Fujifilm’s motion to stay pending determination of its appeals in the Deason and putative case cases.

On September 21, 2018, putative class plaintiffs filed a motion for certification of a settlement class and a motion to transmit notice of the proposed settlement to the proposed class. On October 17, 2018, derivative plaintiff Carmen

Ribbe and Fujifilm filed oppositions to the putative class plaintiffs’ motion to transmit notice to the proposed class. The class has not yet been certified, and preliminary approval has not been granted.

The Appellate Division heard oral argument on September 25, 2018 on Fujifilm’s appeal of the Court’s decision. On October 16, 2018, the Appellate Division entered a decision and order reversing the Court’s rulings, ordering that the claims brought against Fujifilm in the cases by Mr. Deason and the purported class be dismissed, and further ordering that the preliminary injunction of the proposed Fuji Transaction be dissolved.

Xerox will vigorously defend these lawsuits to the extent that the proceedings continue as to Xerox. At this time, however, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in these lawsuits. Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs.


On May 24, 2018, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed with the Court by Carmen Ribbe against all defendants in the putative class action described above, as well as Centerview Partners, LLC. Plaintiff made no pre-complaint demand. The Ribbe complaint contains allegations of breaches of fiduciary duty similar to those in the putative class complaint, and further alleges that Fujifilm and Centerview aided and abetted those breaches, and that the directors breached their fiduciary duties and wasted corporate assets by, among other things, agreeing to releases of claims against them and allowing certain alleged payments in settlement of the Deason and putative class cases. It seeks unspecified damages for Xerox, rescission or reformation of the Deason and putative class settlements, restitution of funds allegedly paid to the directors, injunctive relief against wrongful practices, costs and attorneys’ fees, as well as other relief. 

On August 13, 2018, the Xerox defendants and Fujifilm filed motions to dismiss or stay the complaint. The motions are fully briefed.

On or about August 10, 2018, the parties filed a stipulated proposed order of discontinuance without prejudice as to Centerview in light of a recent agreement between Centerview and Xerox. On August 27, 2018, the Court declined to so-order the discontinuance absent Xerox’s providing notice thereof to shareholders, and ordered the parties to confer regarding notice publication.

Xerox believes the lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend it. At this time, however, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in this litigation. Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs.


On June 18, 2018, Fujifilm filed a complaint against Xerox in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, relating to the Fuji Transaction agreements. The complaint alleges that Xerox (1) willfully breached the Fuji Transaction agreements by purporting to terminate them to appease Messrs. Icahn and Deason and using as a pretext issues with Fujifilm’s untimely submitted financials, and by settling the Deason litigation without notice to or consent by Fujifilm; (2) willfully breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failing to support and use best efforts to conclude the Fuji Transaction, thus depriving Fujifilm of the benefit of its bargain; and (3) effected a change in Xerox’s recommendation regarding the Fuji Transaction, entitling Fujifilm to terminate the Fuji Transaction agreements and to receive from Xerox a $183 termination fee. Fujifilm seeks a judgment for damages to be determined at trial in an amount in excess of $1.0 billion plus punitive damages; a declaration regarding the alleged change in recommendation such that Fujifilm may terminate the transaction and Xerox must pay the $183 termination fee and other remedies; costs and attorneys’ fees; and other relief the court may deem appropriate. 

At a conference on September 24, 2018, the Court stayed all discovery pending resolution of Xerox’s motion to dismiss. Xerox filed its motion to dismiss on October 1, 2018.

Xerox believes the lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend it. At this time, however, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in this litigation. Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs.

Other Contingencies

We have issued or provided approximately $320 of guarantees as of September 30, 2018 in the form of letters of credit or surety bonds issued to i) support certain insurance programs; ii) support our obligations related to the Brazil tax and labor contingencies; and iii) support certain contracts, primarily with public sector customers, which require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of our performance of contractual obligations.

In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract; the probability of which we believe is remote. We believe that our capacity in the surety markets as well as under various credit arrangements (including our Credit Facility) is sufficient to allow us to respond to future requests for proposals that require such credit support.

the obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have not historically made significant payments for these indemnifications. Additionally, under certain of our acquisition agreements, we have provided for additional consideration to be paid to the sellers if established financial targets are achieved post-closing. We have recognized liabilities for these contingent obligations based on an estimate of the fair value of these contingencies at the time of acquisition. Contingent obligations related to indemnifications arising from our divestitures and contingent consideration provided for by our acquisitions are not expected to be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Pending Litigation Relating to the Fuji Transaction

Refer to Note 19 - Contingencies and Litigation for discussion of the Pending Litigation Relating to the Fuji Xerox Transaction.

Fuji Xerox Transaction Overview and Termination of Agreement

On January 31, 2018, Xerox entered into (i) a Redemption Agreement with FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation, a Japanese company (“Fujifilm”), and Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd., a Japanese company, in which Xerox indirectly holds a 25% equity interest while Fujifilm holds the remaining 75% equity interest (“Fuji Xerox”), and (ii) a Subscription Agreement with Fujifilm (collectively, the “Transaction Agreements”). Under the terms of the Transaction Agreements, Fuji Xerox would have become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox, Xerox shareholders would have received a $2.5 billion special cash dividend and Xerox would have become owned 49.9% by Xerox's shareholders as of the closing date for the transaction and 50.1% by Fujifilm. 

The terms of the Subscription Agreement provided the Company with certain terminations rights, including (a) if the audited financial statements of FX deviated in any material respect from the unaudited financial statements of FX and its subsidiaries provided to the Company prior to the date of the Subscription Agreement and (b) if Fujifilm or FX failed to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in the Subscription Agreement that would cause certain conditions to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreement not to be satisfied, which breach or failure to perform could not be cured or, if capable of cure, had not been cured by the earlier of 30 days following written notice thereof from the Company to Fujifilm. 

As a result of the failure by Fujifilm to deliver the audited financial statements of FX by April 15, 2018 and the material deviations reflected in the audited financial statements of FX, when delivered, the Company determined that it was in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to terminate the Subscription Agreement in accordance with the termination rights set forth therein, taking into account other circumstances limiting the ability of the Company, Fujifilm and FX to consummate a transaction. On May 13, 2018, prior to entry into the Settlement Agreement discussed in Note 19 - Contingencies and Litigation, the Company delivered written notice of termination of the Subscription Agreement to Fujifilm. By virtue of the termination of the Subscription Agreement, the Redemption Agreement terminated automatically. The Company's termination of the Transaction Agreements is the subject of pending litigation.


Bridge Facility Termination

On January 31, 2018, Xerox entered into a Commitment Letter with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., which provided a commitment for a $2.5 billion unsecured bridge loan facility that would have been available for Xerox to pay the special one-time cash dividend of $2.5 billion to existing shareholders of Xerox in connection with the Transaction Agreements, as described above.

Concurrent with the termination of the Transaction Agreements, the commitment to provide the unsecured bridge loan facility was terminated in the second quarter 2018 and, as a result, the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs of $16 were written-off.

Currency Impact

To better understand the trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars on revenue and expenses. We refer to this analysis as "constant currency", “currency impact” or “the impact from currency.” This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate. This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates. The constant currency impact for signings growth is calculated on the basis of plan currency rates.

Fuji Xerox Adjustments


In 2018, in connection with the completion of the audits of Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year-end financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, as well as the review of Fuji Xerox’s unaudited interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, additional adjustments and misstatements were identified. These additional adjustments and misstatements were to the previously reported Net income of Fuji Xerox for the period from 2010 through 2017 and are incremental to the items identified by the IIC noted above. These incremental adjustments primarily relate to Fuji Xerox’s Asia Pacific subsidiaries and involve improper revenue recognition, including revenue associated with leasing transactions, additional provisions for bad debt allowances and other asset impairments. In certain instances, some of the adjustments related to inappropriate accounting and reporting practices in the Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific subsidiaries and are further evidence of inadequate management oversight and an insufficient entity level monitoring system for financial statements of subsidiaries beyond what was previously identified by the IIC. Fuji Xerox is committed to implementing additional measures to remediate these newly identified issues.

Third Quarter 2018 Review

Total revenue of $2.35 billion for third quarter 2018 declined 5.8% from third quarter 2017 and included a 1.1-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. Post sale revenue, which primarily reflects contracted services, equipment maintenance, supplies and financing, was $1.84 billion and represented 78% of total revenue. Post sale revenue declined 6.4% from third quarter 2017 and included a 1.2-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. The decline in post sale revenue primarily reflected the continuing lower page volume trends, an ongoing competitive price environment, a lower population of devices and lower supplies revenue. The lower population of devices is partly due to the loss of market share for multiple quarters leading up to the ConnectKey launch. These declines were partially offset by higher revenues from our partner print services offering and higher paper sales in developing markets. Total equipment revenue of $511 million decreased 3.8%, including a 1.1-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. The decline of total equipment revenue primarily reflected the impact of lower high-end sales and price declines of approximately 5%. These declines were partially offset by higher sales of our ConnectKey devices and demand for our recently launched Iridesse production press and higher sales through our Enterprise channel in the U.S. 

Total revenue of $7.30 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 declined 2.9% from the prior year period and included a 1.5-percentage point favorable impact from currency. Post sale revenue of $5.73 billion, which represented 78% of total revenue, declined 3.2% and included a 1.6-percentage point favorable impact from currency. The decline in post sale revenue primarily reflected continuing lower page volume trends, an ongoing competitive price environment, a lower population of devices, as well as the higher mix of installs of lower usage devices. These declines were partially offset by higher revenues from our Global Imaging business as well as higher paper sales. Total equipment revenue of $1.57 billion declined 1.8% including a 1.3-percentage point favorable impact from currency. The decline of total equipment revenue reflected the impact of lower OEM sales, lower revenue from our iGen and high-end black-and white systems and price declines of approximately 5%. These declines were partially offset by higher sales of our ConnectKey devices and higher revenues from our Global Imaging business and developing markets.



The decrease in Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the respective prior year periods was primarily due to lower revenues and higher Income tax expense, which included an additional charge of $95 million in third quarter 2018 related to the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"). These impacts were partially offset by the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements and lower non-service retirement-related costs. The decrease in Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was also partially offset by lower Transaction and related costs, net, primarily due to recoveries during third quarter 2018. The decrease in Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was negatively impacted by Transaction and related costs, net and lower Equity in net income from unconsolidated affiliates, which included our share of a significant restructuring charge recorded by Fuji Xerox in the first quarter of 2018. 

Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

The decrease in adjusted1 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the respective prior year periods was primarily related to lower revenues and higher income tax expense, partially offset by the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements. The decrease in adjusted1 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was partially offset by higher Equity in net income from unconsolidated affiliates, while adjusted1 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was negatively impacted by lower Equity in net income from unconsolidated affiliates, which included an out-of-period adjustment recorded during the first quarter of 2018.

Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by a potential increase in the cost of our products as a result of new or incremental trade protection measures such as, increased import tariffs, import or export restrictions and requirements and the revocation or material modification of trade agreements. We are currently evaluating the impact of potentially new import tariffs on our products, which could significantly increase their cost. We are continuing to monitor developments in this area and will make efforts to mitigate the impact to the extent possible. 

Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $725 million, as compared to a use of cash of $30 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to the prior year voluntary contributions of $500 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans and the reclassification of $170 million of collections of deferred proceeds and beneficial interests from the sale of receivables to investing cash flows as a result of an accounting change in the prior year (refer to Note 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Operating cash flows also increased due to improved working capital2 as well as lower other pension contributions. 

Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $40 million and included capital expenditures of $73 million, which were partially offset by proceeds of $32 million from the sale of non-core business assets. Cash used in financing activities was $815 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 reflecting $284 million for share repurchases, payments of $265 million on Senior Notes, $25 million related to the termination of a capital lease obligation, $19 million of bridge facility costs and dividend payments of $204 million.

CC - See "Currency Impact" section for a description of Constant Currency.



Equipment sales revenue decreased 3.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to third quarter 2017, with a 1.1-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency, while equipment sales revenue decreased 1.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the prior year period, with a 1.3-percentage point favorable impact from currency. Both periods were impacted by price declines of approximately 5% (which were in-line with our historic declines). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the decline at constant currency1 included a 4.5-percentage point and a 3.4-percentage point impact, respectively, from lower OEM equipment sales.

•Entry - For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the increase in both periods, compared to their respective prior year periods, reflected higher sales of our ConnectKey devices in developing markets and U.S. indirect channels.

Table of Contents 

•Mid-range - For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the increase in both periods, compared to their respective prior year periods, reflected higher sales through our Enterprise channel in the U.S., as well as higher sales of lower-end devices in developing markets. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the increase was partially offset by lower revenues from indirect channels and from our Global Imaging business, while for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the increase was also attributed to higher sales from our Global Imaging business. 

•High-end - For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the decrease primarily reflected lower revenues from iGen in the U.S. along with lower revenues from black-and-white systems consistent with market decline trends. These declines were only partially mitigated by demand for the recently launched Iridesse production press. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the decrease was also attributed to lower installs of the Versant systems (partially as a result of lapping the prior year launch).

Total Installs




•8% decrease in color multifunction devices, reflecting lower sales through our U.S. channels.

•21% increase in black-and-white multifunction devices, driven largely by higher activity from low-end devices in developing markets as well as higher sales of our ConnectKey devices through indirect channels in the U.S. and Europe. 


•8% increase in mid-range color installs reflecting higher demand for our ConnectKey products from our U.S. Enterprise channel (primarily from large and public sector accounts) as well as higher sales of lower-end A3 devices in developing markets.

Costs, Expenses and Other Income 

Summary of Key Financial Ratios





Pre-tax Income Margin

Third quarter 2018 pre-tax income margin of 8.2% increased 1.5-percentage points as compared to third quarter 2017. The increase was primarily driven by lower Transaction and related costs, net as well as lower Restructuring and related costs and benefits from our business transformation actions which outpaced the revenue declines.

Pre-tax income margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of 6.3% increased 1.7-percentage points as compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by lower Restructuring and related costs and benefits from our business transformation actions as well as lower Other expenses, net, offset partially by revenue declines and Transaction and related costs, net. 


Third quarter 2018 adjusted1 operating margin of 13.1% increased 1.0-percentage points as compared to third quarter 2017, including a 0.4-percentage point favorable impact from transaction currency. The increase primarily reflects higher equity income and SAG savings and cost productivity associated with our business transformation actions which more than offset the pace of revenue decline.

Adjusted1 operating margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of 11.8% decreased 0.3-percentage points as compared to the prior year period, including a 0.4-percentage point unfavorable impact within SAG expenses primarily related to the exit of a real estate facility (0.3-percentage point) and the cancellation of certain IT projects (0.1-percentage point). The decline is also associated with lower revenues and equity income which more than offset cost productivity and savings associated with our business transformation actions. Adjusted1 operating margin includes favorable transaction currency of 0.6-percentage points.



Gross Margin

Third quarter 2018 gross margin of 40.1% was flat compared to third quarter 2017, including a 0.4-percentage point favorable impact from transaction currency and also reflecting higher equipment margin partially offset by lower post sale margin and a less profitable mix of our revenue streams.

Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of 39.9% decreased 0.3-percentage points as compared to the prior year period reflecting lower post sale margin, a less profitable mix of revenues and the impact of pricing, partially offset by cost productivity and savings associated with our business transformation actions. Gross margin includes favorable impact from transaction currency of 0.5-percentage points.

Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

Third quarter 2018 equipment gross margin of 34.6% increased 5.1-percentage points as compared to third quarter 2017, reflecting the benefit from lower OEM sales (which carry a negative upfront margin) and favorable transaction currency as well as savings from cost productivity initiatives.

Equipment gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of 32.9% increased 3.3-percentage points as compared to the prior year period, reflecting benefits from lower OEM sales, favorable transaction currency as well as savings from cost productivity initiatives, partially offset by the impact of pricing and a less profitable mix of revenues.

Third quarter 2018 post sale gross margin of 41.7% decreased 1.2-percentage points as compared to third quarter 2017 reflecting lower revenues and an unfavorable mix of lower supplies, partially offset by productivity and restructuring savings.

Post sale gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of 41.9% decreased 1.1-percentage points as compared to the prior year period reflecting lower revenues and the impact of pricing, partially offset by productivity and restructuring savings and modestly favorable transaction currency.







Selling, Administrative and General Expenses (SAG)

SAG as a percentage of revenue of 24.8% decreased 0.4-percentage points compared to third quarter 2017, reflecting primarily the benefit from productivity and restructuring associated with our business transformation actions. 

SAG of $583 million was $47 million lower than third quarter 2017, including an approximate $5 million favorable impact from currency. The reduction reflected primarily productivity and restructuring savings associated with our business transformation actions, which were partially offset by $5 million of charges related to the cancellation of certain IT projects as we continue to evaluate the returns on our IT investment. Bad debt expense of $10 million was $2 million higher than third quarter 2017.

SAG as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of 25.1% was flat as compared to the prior year period, reflecting primarily the benefit from productivity and restructuring associated with our business transformation actions. SAG as a percentage of revenue includes a 0.4-percentage point unfavorable impact from the exit of a real estate facility and the cancellation of certain IT projects.

SAG of $1,835 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $55 million lower than the prior year period, including an approximate $24 million unfavorable impact from currency. The reduction reflected primarily productivity and restructuring savings associated with our business transformation actions. These improvements were partially offset by $34 million of charges related to the accelerated depreciation from the early termination of a capital lease associated with a surplus facility ($22 million) and the cancellation of certain IT projects ($12 million). Bad debt expense of $35 million increased $5 million compared to the prior year period and on a trailing twelve month basis (TTM) remained at less than one percent of receivables.

Restructuring and Related Costs


Restructuring and related costs were $91 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and included $104 million of severance costs related to headcount of approximately 1,850 employees worldwide and $13 million of lease cancellation costs partially offset by $26 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives.

Third quarter 2017 Restructuring and related costs of $35 million included net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $34 million as well as $1 million of additional costs primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the strategic transformation program. Third quarter 2017 net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $34 million included $39 million of severance costs related to headcount of approximately 600 employees worldwide. These costs were partially offset by $5 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives. The third quarter 2017 actions impacted several functional areas, with approximately 80% focused on SAG reductions and approximately 20% focused on gross margin improvements. 

Restructuring and related costs were $192 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and included net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $174 million as well as $18 million of additional costs primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the strategic transformation program. Net restructuring and asset impairment charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 of $174 million included $196 million of severance costs related to headcount of approximately 2,100 employees worldwide and $3 million of lease cancellation costs partially offset by $25 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives, which included a $5 million favorable adjustment on the early termination of the lease for the corporate airplane.

The restructuring reserve balance as of September 30, 2018 for all programs was $70 million, of which $67 million is expected to be spent over the next twelve months. 

Refer to Note 10 - Restructuring Programs in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring programs.

Transaction and Related Costs, Net


•Costs related to the proposed combination transaction with Fuji Xerox, which was terminated in May 2018, primarily for third-party accounting, legal, consulting and other similar types of services. 

•Costs related to the settlement agreement reached with certain shareholders in the second quarter of 2018 as well as third-party legal and other related costs associated with on-going litigation resulting from the terminated combination transaction and other related shareholder actions. 

•$19 million of costs related to the commitment for a $2.5 billion unsecured bridge loan facility, which was terminated concurrent with the termination of the Fuji Xerox combination transaction.

•Recoveries of approximately $45 million, which included insurance recoveries for litigation and related settlement costs of approximately $30 million and a settlement refund from a financial adviser, associated with the terminated combination transaction, for approximately $13 million. We continue to pursue additional recoveries from insurance carriers and other parties for costs and expenses related to the terminated transaction and shareholder litigation and therefore additional recoveries and adjustments may be recorded in future periods, when finalized. 

Amortization of Intangible Assets

Amortization of intangible assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $36 million was $5 million lower compared to the prior year period.

Worldwide Employment

Worldwide employment was approximately 33,200 as of September 30, 2018 and decreased by approximately 2,100 from December 31, 2017, largely driven by our business transformation. Approximately half of the reduction was associated with restructuring actions, while the remainder resulted from net attrition (attrition net of gross hires), of which a large portion is not expected to be backfilled.

Other Expenses, Net


Non-Financing Interest Expense

Non-financing interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was $28 million and was $1 million lower than third quarter of 2017. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $1 million from third quarter of 2017 due to a lower debt balance, partially offset by higher average interest rates.

Non-financing interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $84 million and was $5 million lower as compared to the prior year period. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $4 million from the prior year comparable period primarily due to a lower debt balance reflecting debt repayments of approximately $1.3 billion in the first quarter 2017 partially offset by $1.0 billion of new debt issued in the third quarter 2017 to fund, among other things, a $500 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans, partially offset by higher average interest rates.

Non-Service Retirement-Related Costs

Non-service retirement-related costs decreased $2 million and $46 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior year periods. Both period decreases were primarily driven by the favorable impact of higher pension contributions and asset returns in the prior year, with the decrease in third quarter 2018 partially offset by higher losses from pension settlements in the U.S.

Gains on Sales of Businesses and Assets

Gains on sales of businesses and assets decreased $10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to third quarter 2017, reflecting primarily the prior year sale of a research facility in Grenoble, France (which primarily supported the discontinued BPO business). 

Gains on the sales of business and assets increased $21 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the prior year period, reflecting a higher level of sales of non-core business assets in 2018.

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt

During the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a $13 million loss associated with the repayment of $300 million in Senior Notes.

Income Taxes


Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 




Our effective tax rate is based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors, including the taxation of foreign income. In addition, our effective tax rate will change based on discrete or other nonrecurring events that may not be predictable. 



Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”)

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering the U.S. statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and implementing a territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

During the fourth quarter 2017, we recorded an estimated non-cash charge of $400 million reflecting our provisional estimated impact associated with the provisions of the Tax Act based on currently available information. Our estimated charge incorporated assumptions based on our current interpretation of the Tax Act as well as information available at that time and was subject to change, possibly materially, as we completed our analysis and received additional clarification and implementation guidance. During third quarter 2018 we adjusted our provisional estimate by an additional charge of $95 million reflecting certain positions taken on our recently filed 2017 income tax return as well as consideration of additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The adjustment includes changes to the determination of the one-time deemed repatriation tax as well as additional re-measurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower enacted statutory tax rate. The total charge of $495 million related to the Tax Act remains a provisional estimate as we continue to evaluate and consider additional impacts including those related to interpretive guidance from the U.S. Treasury and IRS as well as filing positions we may take on our 2018 U.S. Tax Return. Accordingly, additional adjustments may be recorded, possibly material, in the fourth quarter 2018 as we finalize our estimate related to the Tax Act. Any adjustments to this provisional amount will be reported as a component of Income tax expense.

Effective January 1, 2018, we became subject to several provisions of the Tax Act including computations related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ("GILTI"), Foreign Derived Intangible Income ("FDII"), Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax ("BEAT"), and IRC Section 163(j) interest limitation (Interest Limitation). Our current estimate for the GILTI, FDII and Interest Limitation rules was determined to be immaterial, however we currently estimate that we are subject to BEAT. Accordingly, our third quarter and year to date 2018 effective tax rate includes the estimated impact for BEAT, which has also been incorporated into our estimated annual effective tax for 2018. Similar to the provisional charge recorded in the fourth quarter 2017 associated with the enactment of the Tax Act, the estimates for these additional provisions of the Tax Act were made based on our current interpretation of the Tax Act as well as currently available information and may change, as we complete our analysis and receive additional clarification and implementation guidance. Changes in interpretations and assumptions as well as actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act may also impact these estimates.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $1,218 million and $1,368 million, respectively. There were no borrowings under our Credit Facility or Commercial Paper Program at September 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017, respectively. 

We have narrowed our full year guidance range for 2018 operating cash flows from continuing operations to be between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, from our original guidance of between $900 million and $1.1 billion, partly due to lower expected pension contributions. Additionally, we have lowered our full year 2018 capital expenditures expectation to be approximately $100 million, from our original expectation of $150 million. We continue to expect dividend payments to common shareholders to be approximately $260 million.

management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes. The related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.

We are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet. As permitted, certain of these derivative contracts have been designated for hedge accounting treatment. Certain of our derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are effective as economic hedges. These derivative contracts are likewise required to be recognized each period at fair value and therefore do result in some level of volatility. The level of volatility will vary with the type and amount of derivative hedges outstanding, as well as fluctuations in the currency and interest rate markets during the period. The related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.

By their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange and interest rate movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. We do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a diversified group of major financial institutions. Further, our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating. Credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties.

The current market events have not required us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risk. Refer to Note 12 – Financial Instruments in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and information on our financial risk management strategies.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We have reported our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, we have discussed our financial results using the non-GAAP measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related income tax effects.


These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Summary

Management believes that all of these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current period’s results against the corresponding prior period’s results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures.
