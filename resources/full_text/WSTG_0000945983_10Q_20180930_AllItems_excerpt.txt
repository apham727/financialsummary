 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”), have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete audited financial statements.  

 The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, evaluation of performance obligations and allocation of revenue to distinct items, contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on its historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments that are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for fair presentation, have been included in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company’s actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

 Effective January 1, 2018 we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with customers, or Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 606 using the full retrospective method, as discussed in detail in Note 5. All amounts and disclosures set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been updated to comply with ASC 606 as discussed in Note 5.   

 Reclassifications  

 Certain reclassifications and immaterial revisions have been made to the prior period financial statements to conform to the current-year presentation.  




 Table of Contents  

 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease guidance under FASB ASC Topic 840, Leases, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating leases with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of earnings. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. It is expected that assets and liabilities will increase as a result of the adoption of this standard.  

 In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ("ASU No. 2016-13"). ASU No. 2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements, particularly its recognition of allowances for accounts receivable.   

 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (“ASU 2016-15”) which reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  


 In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, “Scope of Modification Accounting”, to reduce diversity in practice and provide clarity regarding existing guidance in ASC 718, “Stock Compensation”. The amendments in this updated guidance clarify that an entity should apply modification accounting in response to a change in the terms and conditions of an entity’s share-based payment awards unless three newly specified criteria are met. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The new guidance was effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2018 and did not impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as it is not the Company’s practice to change either the terms or conditions of stock-based payment awards once they are granted.  

  In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. The amendments in this update also make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current U.S. GAAP. ASU No. 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years; the ASU allows for early adoption in any interim period after issuance of the update. The Company is currently assessing the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.  


 In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05, “Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SEC Update), Income Taxes (Topic 740)”. ASU 2018-05 provides guidance regarding the recording of tax impacts where uncertainty exists, in the period of adoption of the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”), which allowed companies to reflect provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is incomplete but for which a reasonable estimate could be 


 Table of Contents  

determined. The Company completed its Federal and State income tax filings for 2017 with no material change to amounts previously reported.   

 In June 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2018-07, “Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” which aligns the measurement and classification guidance for share-based payments to nonemployees with that for employees, with certain exceptions. It expands the scope of ASC 718 to include share-based payments granted to nonemployees in exchange for goods or services used or consumed in the entity’s own operations and supersedes the guidance in ASC 505-50. The ASU retains the existing cost attribution guidance, which requires entities to recognize compensation cost for nonemployee awards in the same period and in the same manner (i.e., capitalize or expense) they would if they paid cash for the goods or services, but it moves the guidance to ASC 718. The guidance also allows nonpublic entities to account for nonemployee awards using certain practical expedients that are already available for employee awards, but the same accounting policies must be used for awards to both employees and nonemployees. ASU 2018-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.  

 In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-09 – Codification Improvements, which facilitates amendments to a variety of topics to clarify, correct errors in, or make minor improvements to the accounting standards codification. The effective date of the standard is dependent on the facts and circumstances of each amendment. Some amendments do not require transition guidance and will be effective upon the issuance of this standard. A majority of the amendments in ASU 2018-09 will be effective in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We will be required to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  


 Assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries have been translated using the end of the reporting period exchange rates, and related revenues and expenses have been translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded as income or expenses as amounts are settled. The net sales from our foreign operations for the first nine months of 2018 were $13.9 million as compared to $14.1 million in the first nine months of 2017. The net sales from our foreign operations for the third quarter of 2018 were $4.0 million as compared to $4.6 million in the third quarter of 2017.   


 Cumulative translation adjustments have been classified within accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is a separate component of stockholders’ equity in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income.”  


 Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective method, which requires us to restate our historical financial information to reflect the adoption as of the earliest reporting period presented. There was no adjustment to equity as a result of the adoption. The most significant impact of adopting the standard relates to the determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent in the sale of third party security software and software that is highly interdependent with support, as well as maintenance, support and other services. Historically, under the transfer of risk and rewards model of revenue recognition, the Company has accounted for primarily all of its sales on a gross basis. The new guidance requires the Company to identify performance obligations and assess transfer of control. While assessing its performance obligations for sales of security software and software subscriptions that are highly interdependent with support, the Company determined that the vendor has ongoing performance obligations with the end customer that are not separately identifiable from the software itself. The Company also determined that the vendor has ongoing performance obligation for sales of certain third-party maintenance, support and service contracts. In these instances, the Company has determined that it does not have control and is acting as an agent in the sale. When acting as an agent in a transaction, the Company accounts for sales on a net basis, with the vendor cost associated with the sale recognized as a reduction of revenue.   


 Table of Contents  

 ASC 606 Adoption Impact to Previously Reported Results  

 The tables below present historical information adjusted as if the standard had been adopted on January 1, 2017 for all periods presented.   



 Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer — A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these goods or services, (ii) the contract has commercial substance and, (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods or services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. We apply judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer. The Company considers customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master agreements or general terms and conditions of sale, to be contracts with customers. All revenue is generated from contracts with customers.   

 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract — Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the goods or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, we apply judgment to determine whether promised goods or services are capable of being distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.  


 Table of Contents  

 Determination of the transaction price —The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. Net sales are recorded net of estimated discounts, rebates, and returns. Vendor rebates and price protection are recorded when earned as a reduction to cost of sales or merchandise inventory, as applicable. Cooperative reimbursements from vendors, which are earned and available, are recorded in the period the related advertising expenditure is incurred. Cooperative reimbursements are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales.  

 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract — If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price, or SSP, basis. We determine standalone SSP based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through established standard prices, we use judgement and estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market pricing and pricing related to similar products. Contracts with a significant financing component are discounted to their present value at contract inception and accreted up to the expected payment amounts. These contracts generally offer customers extended payment terms of up to three years.  


 Disaggregation of Revenue  



 Hardware and software product - Hardware product consists of sales of hardware manufactured by third parties. Hardware product is delivered from our warehouse or drop shipped directly from the vendor. Revenue from our hardware products is recognized on a gross basis, with the selling price to the customer as net sales, and the cost of the related product as cost of sales, upon transfer of control to the customer, as the Company is acting a principal in the transaction. Control is generally deemed to have passed to the customer upon transfer of title and risk of ownership.  

  Software product consists of sales of perpetual and term software licenses for products developed by third party vendors, which are distinct from related maintenance and support. Software licenses are delivered via electronic license keys provided by the vendor to the end user. Revenue from the sale of software products is recognized on a gross basis, with the selling price to the customer as net sales, and the cost of the related product as cost of sales, upon transfer of control to our customers as the Company is a principal in the transaction. Control is deemed to have passed to the customer when they acquire the right to use or copy the software under license as substantially all product functionality is available to the customer at the time of sale.  

 Software maintenance and support, commonly known as software assurance or post contract support, consists of software updates and technical support provided by the software vendor to the licensor over a period of time. In cases where the software maintenance is distinct from the related software license, software maintenance is accounted for as a 


 Table of Contents  

separate performance obligation. In cases where the software maintenance is not distinct from the related software license, it is accounted for as a single performance obligation with the related license. We utilize judgement in determining whether the maintenance is distinct from the software itself. This involves considering if the software provides its original intended functionality without the updates, or is dependent on frequent, or continuous updates to maintain its functionality. See Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract for a discussion of the allocation of maintenance and support costs when they are distinct from the related software licenses and Software - security and highly interdependent with support for a discussion of maintenance and support costs when they are not distinct from the related software license.  

 Software - security and highly interdependent with support - Software - security software and software highly interdependent with support consists of sales of security subscriptions and other licensed software products whose functionality is highly interdependent with, and therefore not distinct from, related software maintenance. Delivery of the software license and related support over time is considered a single performance obligation of the third-party vendor for these products. The Company is an agent in these transactions, with revenue being recorded on a net basis when its performance obligation of processing a valid order between the supplier and customer contracting for the services is complete.  

 Maintenance, support and other services revenue - Maintenance, support and other services revenue consists of third-party post-contract support that is not critical or essential to the core functionality of the related licensed software, and, to a lesser extent, from third-party professional services, software as a service, and cloud subscriptions. Revenue from maintenance, support and other service revenues is recognized on a net basis, upon fulfillment of an order to the customer, as the Company is an agent in the transaction, and its performance obligations are complete at the time a valid order between the parties is processed.  

 Costs to obtain and fulfill a contract - We pay commissions and related payroll taxes to sales personnel when customers are invoiced. These costs are recorded as selling general and administrative expenses in the period earned as all of our performance obligations are complete within a short window of processing the order.   

 Contract balances -Accounts receivable is recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and returns. A receivable is recognized in the period we deliver goods or provide services or when our right to consideration is unconditional. Payment terms on invoiced amounts are typically 30-75 days. The balance of accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts and returns, as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2018 is presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Accounts receivable-long-term result from product sales with extended payment terms that are discounted to their present values at the Company’s estimates of prevailing market rates at the time of the sale. The Company has determined that these amounts do not represent variable consideration as the amount earned is fixed. In subsequent periods, the accounts receivable is increased to the amounts due and payable by the customers through the accretion of interest income on the unpaid accounts receivable due in future years. The amounts due under these long-term accounts receivable due within one year are reclassified to the current portion of accounts receivable and are shown net of reserves. As our revenues are generally recognized at a point in time in the same period as they are billed, we have no deferred revenue balances. Provisions for doubtful accounts including long-term accounts receivable and returns are estimated based on historical write offs, sales returns and credit memo analysis which are adjusted to actual on a periodic basis.  



 Table of Contents  

basis with the selling price to the customer recorded as sales and the cost of the product or software recorded as cost of sales. Sales where we are acting as an agent are recognized on a net basis at the date our performance obligations are complete. Under net revenue recognition, the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in revenue being equal to the gross profit on the transaction.   


 The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated fair value at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 because of the relative short maturity of these instruments. The Company’s accounts receivable long-term is discounted to their present value at estimated prevailing market rates at the date of sale which approximates current rates.   


 Accounts Receivable – From time to time, we sell accounts receivable to a financial institution on a non-recourse basis. The financial institution is responsible for all servicing of the receivables purchased. At September 30, 2018, accounts receivable includes $6.5 million of accounts receivable which have been sold to a financial institution with payment due to the Company on November 12, 2018. The receivables are recorded at their discounted fair value at September 30 ,2018.  



 For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded depreciation and amortization expense of $0.4 million and $0.4 million respectively, which is included in general and administrative expense.

 On November 15, 2017, the Company entered into a $20,000 revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) pursuant to a Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Loan Note (the “Note”), Second Amended and Restated Security Agreement (the “Security Agreement”) and Second Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement (the “Pledge Agreement”). The Credit Facility, which will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, matures on August 31, 2020, at which time the Company must pay all outstanding principal of all outstanding loans plus all accrued and unpaid interest, and any, fees, costs and expenses. In addition, the Company will pay regular monthly payments of all accrued and unpaid interest. The interest rate for any borrowings under the Credit Facility is subject to change from time to time based on the changes in the LIBOR Rate, as defined in the Loan Agreement (the “Index”). The Index was 2.26% at September 30, 2018. Interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Note will be calculated using a rate of 1.50 percentage points over the Index. If the Index becomes unavailable during the term of the Credit Facility, interest will be based upon the Prime Rate (as defined in the Loan Agreement) after notifying the Company. The Credit Facility is secured by the assets of the Company.  


 At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility.   


 Our basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation that determines net income per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to their participation rights in dividends and undistributed earnings or losses. Non-vested restricted stock awards that include non-forfeitable rights to dividends are considered participating securities. Per share amounts are computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average shares outstanding during each period. Diluted and basic earnings per share are the same because the restricted shares are the only potentially dilutive security.

 The Company had two major vendors that accounted for 25.1% and 14.8%, respectively, of total purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 22.6% and 15.2% of total purchases for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The Company had two major vendors that accounted for 27.0% and 14.1%, respectively, of total purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2017, and 27.9% and 14.1% of total purchases for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The Company had two major customers that accounted for 27.5% and 16.5%, respectively, of its net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and 37.3%, and 15.6% of total net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018. These same customers accounted for 40.6% and 8.8% respectively, of total net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2018. Two customers accounted for 28.6% and 15.1% of total net accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017. The Company had two major customers that accounted for 20.3% and 17.9%, respectively, of its total net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2017, and 20.8%, and 17.2% of total net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2017.   


 The Company has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. The Company has recorded an accrual of $0.6 million, net of federal tax benefit, for potential liabilities for state income taxes in states which have enacted economic nexus statutes and the Company has not filed income tax returns. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as operating expenses. The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions it takes and expects to take on its tax returns, and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter.  

 The TCJA was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduced significant changes to the U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the TCJA reduces U.S. statutory tax rates from 34% to 21%. Accordingly, we remeasured our deferred taxes as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the reduced rate that will apply in future periods when these deferred taxes are settled or realized.  


 Table of Contents  

 Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the TCJA we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of September 30, 2018. As we collect and prepare necessary data and interpret the TCJA and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which adjustments are made. The accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will be completed in 2018.  

 The effective tax rate for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2018 was 35.4% and 24.2%, compared to 32.2% and 33.3%, for the same periods last year. The company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was impacted by limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation resulting from section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and adjustments to the accrual for state income taxes in states which have enacted economic nexus statutes. The Company recorded a $0.4 million tax benefit related to separation expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 which were accounted for as a discrete item, resulting in a 18% effective tax benefit rate on that item. The Company also recorded an adjustment to its accrual for potential liabilities for state income taxes in states which have enacted economic nexus statutes of $0.2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The effective tax rate for ordinary income was 24.2% for the three and nine month ended September 30, 2018.  


 The 2012 Stock-Based Compensation Plan (the “2012 Plan”) authorizes the grant of Stock Options, Stock Units, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Stock Bonuses and other equity-based awards. The total number of shares of Common Stock initially available for award under the 2012 Plan was 600,000 which was increased to 1,000,000 shares by shareholder approval at the Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting in June 2018. As of September 30, 2018, the number of shares of Common stock available for future award grants to employees, officers and directors under the 2012 Plan is 530,022.  

 During 2017, the Company granted a total of 87,076 shares of Restricted Stock to officers and employees. These shares of Restricted Stock vest between twelve and twenty equal quarterly installments. In 2017, a total of 22,694 shares of Restricted Stock were forfeited as a result of officers and employees terminating employment with the Company.  

 During 2018, the Company granted a total of 123,000 shares of Restricted Stock to officers, employees and directors. In 2018, a total of 7,176 shares of Restricted Stock were forfeited. These shares of Restricted Stock vest between one and twenty equal quarterly installments.   



 As of September 30, 2018, there is approximately $1.6 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.2 years.  

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized share-based compensation cost of $2.6 million and $1.0 million respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, $1.7 million of stock compensation expense, related to accelerated vesting of shares upon the resignation of the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, was included in separation expense. All other share-based compensation is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

 FASB ASC Topic 280, “Segment Reporting,” requires that public companies report profits and losses and certain other information on their “reportable operating segments” in their annual and interim financial statements. The internal organization used by the public company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) to assess performance and allocate resources determines the basis for reportable operating segments. The Company’s CODM is the President, and Chief Executive Officer.  

 The Company is organized into two reportable operating segments. The “Lifeboat Distribution” segment distributes technical software to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide. The “TechXtend” segment is a value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for corporations, government organizations and academic institutions in the United States and Canada.  

 As permitted by FASB ASC Topic 280, the Company has utilized the aggregation criteria in combining its operations in Canada with the domestic segments as the Canadian operations provide the same products and services to similar clients and are considered together when the Company’s CODM decides how to allocate resources.

 On May 11, 2018, the Company entered into a Separation and Release Agreement (the “Separation Agreement”) with Simon Nynens upon his resignation from the Company. The Separation Agreement supersedes and replaces the Employment Agreement, dated January 12, 2006, between Mr. Nynens and the Company.   

  Mr. Nynens is entitled to receive (a) a cash payment of $0.7 million, payable in 12 consecutive, equal monthly installments on the fifteenth day of each month, commencing June 15, 2018; provided that the monthly payments will be delayed until the earlier to occur of Mr. Nynens’ death or November 19, 2018 (the “Delay Period”), and upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments that were delayed will be paid in a lump sum, (b) a one-time, lump sum cash payment of $0.03 million (Mr. Nynens current monthly salary) payable within 30 days after the Separation Date so long as Mr. Nynens performs certain transition services to the extent reasonably requested by the Company; and (c) payment of accrued vacation equal to $0.04 million, (ii) all stock options and stock awards issued to Mr. Nynens, consisting solely of 109,084 shares of restricted common stock issued under the 2012 Stock-Based Compensation Plan, will fully vest and become immediately exercisable and remain exercisable through their original terms.  

 The Company recorded expenses of $2.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 related to the Separation Agreement consisting of $1.7 million for accelerated vesting of restricted stock grants and $0.8 million in other cash payments to be made over during the next twelve months. The compensation is subject to certain limitations on deductibility for income tax purposes under section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (see note 11).

 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

 The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of risk and uncertainties, including those set forth under the heading “Forward Looking Statements” and elsewhere in this report and those set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2018. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

 Overview  


 The Company is organized into two reportable operating segments. The “Lifeboat Distribution” segment distributes technical software to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide. The “TechXtend” segment is a value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for corporations, government organizations and academic institutions in the USA and Canada.  

 Factors Influencing Our Financial Results  

 We derive the majority of our net sales though the sale of third party software licenses, maintenance and service agreements. In our Lifeboat distribution segment, sales are impacted by the number of product lines we distribute, and sales penetration of those products into the reseller channel. In our TechXtend segment sales are generally driven by sales force effectiveness and success in providing superior customer service, competitive pricing, and flexible payment solutions to our customers. Our sales are also impacted by external factors such as levels of IT spending and customer demand for products we distribute.  

 We sell in a competitive environment where gross product margins have historically declined due to competition and changes in product mix towards products where no delivery of a physical product is required. To date, we have been able to implement cost efficiencies such as the use of drop shipments, electronic ordering (“EDI”) and other capabilities to be able to operate our business profitably as gross margins have declined.   

 Selling general and administrative expenses are comprised mainly of employee salaries, commissions and other employee related expenses, facility costs, costs to maintain our IT infrastructure, public company compliance costs and professional fees. We monitor our level of accounts payable, inventory turnover and accounts receivable turnover which are measures of how efficiently we utilize capital in our business.  


 Dividend Policy and Share Repurchase Program. Historically we have sought to return value to investors through the payment of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Total dividends paid and shares repurchased were $0.8 million and $0.02 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, respectively, and $0.8 million and $0.1 million for the quarter 


 Table of Contents  

ended September 30, 2017, respectively. The payment of future dividends and share repurchases is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and dependent on results of operations, projected capital requirements and other factors the Board of Directors may find relevant.  

 Stock Volatility. The technology sector of the United States stock markets is subject to substantial volatility. Numerous conditions which impact the technology sector or the stock market in general or the Company in particular, whether or not such events relate to or reflect upon the Company’s operating performance, could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s Common Stock. Furthermore, fluctuations in the Company’s operating results, announcements regarding litigation, the loss of a significant vendor or customer, increased competition, reduced vendor incentives and trade credit, higher operating expenses, and other developments, could have a significant impact on the market price of our Common Stock.  

 We adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers on retrospective basis effective January 1, 2018. Under ASC 606 net sales for certain maintenance, service and security products we sell are recorded net of the related cost of sales. We refer to these items as being recorded on a “net basis” in the discussion below. Software and hardware products for which sales and cost of sales are reported on separate line items are referred to as being recorded on a gross basis.  

 Forward Looking Statements  

 This report includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Statements in this report regarding future events or conditions, including but not limited to statements regarding industry prospects and the Company’s expected financial position, results of operations, business and financing plans, are forward-looking statements. These statements can be identified by forward-looking words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” and “continue,” or similar words.  

 Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Substantial risks and uncertainties unknown at this time could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the continued acceptance of the Company’s distribution channel by vendors and customers, the timely availability and acceptance of new products, product mix, market conditions, competitive pricing pressures, contribution of key vendor relationships and support programs, including vendor rebates and discounts, as well as factors that affect the software industry in general and other factors generally. We strongly urge current and prospective investors to carefully consider the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in this report and our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2018.  

 The Company operates in a rapidly changing business, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict every risk factor, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of all such risk factors on the Company’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.  

 Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  

 The statements concerning future sales, future gross profit margin and future selling and administrative expenses are forward looking statements involving certain risks and uncertainties such as availability of products, product mix, pricing pressures, market conditions and other factors, which could result in a fluctuation of sales below recent experience.  

 Financial Overview  



 Table of Contents  

The Company reported net income of $1.3 million for each of the quarters ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. Diluted income per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 was $0.29, compared to diluted income per share of $0.30 for the same period in 2017.   

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

 Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  

 On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation.  

 The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

 The Company believes the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements affect its more significant judgments and estimates.  

 Revenue  

 The Company adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with customers using the full retrospective method effective January 1, 2018. See Note 5 to the accompanying financial statements for further information. The Company makes estimates regarding performance obligations inherent in the products and services it sells including, whether ongoing maintenance obligations performed by third party vendors are distinct from the related software licenses, and allocation of sales prices among distinct performance obligations. These estimates require significant judgement to determine whether the software’s functionality is dependent on ongoing maintenance or if substantially all functionality is available in the original software download. We also use judgement in the allocation of sales proceeds among performance obligations, utilizing observable data such as stand-alone selling prices, or market pricing for similar products and services.  

 Allowance for Accounts Receivable  


 Accounts Receivable – Long Term  

 The Company’s accounts receivable long-term are discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates at the time of sale based on prevailing rates. In doing so, the Company considers competitive market rates and other factors. At times the Company sells receivables to a financial institution on a non-recourse basis. The net proceeds from such sales are included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows as changes in accounts receivable.  

 Inventory Allowances  

 The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-offs may be required.

 Income Taxes  

 The Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.  

 Share-Based Payments  

 Under the fair value recognition provision, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We record the impact of forfeitures when they occur. We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock-based awards granted in future periods. Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.  

 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  


 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease guidance under FASB ASC Topic 840, Leases, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating leases with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of earnings. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. It is expected that assets and liabilities will increase as a result of the adoption of this standard.  

 In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ("ASU No. 2016-13"). ASU No. 2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements, particularly its recognition for accounts receivable.   

 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (“ASU 2016-15”) which reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The ASU is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted in fiscal 2018 with modified retrospective application. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  

 In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, “Scope of Modification Accounting”, to reduce diversity in practice and provide clarity regarding existing guidance in ASC 718, “Stock Compensation”. The amendments in this updated guidance clarify that an entity should apply modification accounting in response to a change in the terms and conditions of an entity’s share-based payment awards unless three newly specified criteria are met. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The new guidance was effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2018 and did not impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as it is not the Company’s practice to change either the terms or conditions of stock-based payment awards once they are granted.  

 In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. The amendments in this update also make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current U.S. GAAP. ASU No. 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years; the ASU allows for early adoption in any interim period after issuance of the update. The Company is currently assessing the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.  


 In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05, Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SEC Update), Income Taxes (Topic 740). ASU 2018-05 provides guidance regarding the recording of tax impacts where uncertainty exists, in the period of adoption of the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”), which allowed companies to reflect provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is incomplete but for which a reasonable estimate could be determined. The Company completed its Federal and State income tax filings for 2017 with no material change to amounts previously reported.   

 In June 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2018-07, “Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” which aligns the measurement and classification guidance for share-based payments to nonemployees with that for employees, with certain exceptions. It expands the scope of ASC 718 to include share-based payments granted to nonemployees in exchange for goods or services used or consumed in the entity’s own operations and supersedes the guidance in ASC 505-50. The ASU retains the existing cost attribution guidance, which requires entities to recognize compensation cost for nonemployee awards in the same period and in the same manner (i.e., capitalize or expense) they would if they paid cash for the goods or services, but it moves the guidance to ASC 718. The guidance also allows nonpublic entities to account for nonemployee awards using certain practical expedients that are already available for employee awards, but the same accounting policies must be used for awards to both employees and nonemployees. ASU 2018-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.  

 In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-09 – Codification Improvements, which facilitates amendments to a variety of topics to clarify, correct errors in, or make minor improvements to the accounting standards codification. The effective date of the standard is dependent on the facts and circumstances of each amendment. Some amendments do not require transition guidance and will be effective upon the issuance of this standard. A majority of the amendments in ASU 2018-09 will be effective in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We will be required to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

 Results of Operations  



 Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

 Our management monitors a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business. We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include net sales, gross margin, adjusted gross billings, gross profit as a percentage of gross billings, net income as a percentage of net sales, net income as a percentage of gross billings, and net income excluding separation expenses, net of taxes. We use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the operating performance of our business, develop financial forecasts, make strategic decisions, and prepare and approve annual budgets. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and presented in our consolidated financial statements as well as non-GAAP performance measurement tools.  



 Table of Contents  


 We define adjusted gross billings as net sales in accordance with U.S. GAAP, adjusted for the cost of sales related to Software – security or highly interdependent with support and maintenance, support or other services. We provided a reconciliation of adjusted gross billings to net sales, which is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. We use adjusted gross billings of product and services as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into the volume of business generated by our business, and to analyze the changes to our accounts receivable and accounts payable. Our use of adjusted gross billings of product and services as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider it in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate Adjusted gross billings of product and services or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.  


 We use net income excluding separation payments as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into comparison of our businesses profitability when compared to the prior year. Our use of net income excluding separation expenses, net of tax has limitations, and you should not consider it in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate separation expenses net of tax, or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.  

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2017  

 Net Sales  

 Net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased 23%, or $8.9 million, to $47.9 million, compared to $39.0 million for the same period in 2017. Adjusted gross billings for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased 26%, or $27.3 million, to $134.0 million, compared to $106.6 million for the same period in 2017.   

 Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased $9.4 million, or 27% to $44.1 million, compared to $34.7 million for the same period a year earlier. The increase was due primarily to growth in sales penetration for several of our more significant product lines, as well as the addition of several new product lines. The increases were partially offset by turnover in some vendor and customer accounts, including the termination of one of our vendor distribution agreements that accounted for less than 10% of net sales. While the tenure of our vendor relationships is generally for multiple years, the contractual terms of the distribution agreements themselves are short term in nature and vendors consolidate or change their relationships for various reasons. We operate in a competitive market in which vendor distribution and sales agreements are subject to turnover due to competitive bidding processes and other factors. Adjusted gross billings for the Lifeboat Distribution segment increased $21.8 million or 22% to $122.0 million for the quarter ended 


 Table of Contents  

September 30, 2018. Net sales increased at a higher rate than adjusted gross billings due to the impact of reporting certain products on a net basis.  

 TechXtend segment net sales decreased $0.5 million or 12% to $3.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, compared to $4.3 million for the prior year. Sales in our TechXtend segment may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of IT spending decisions by our larger customers and internal capital allocation decisions regarding capital we allocate to the extended payment program. Adjusted gross billings for the TechXtend segment increased $5.5 million or 86% to $12.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018.   

 During the quarter ended September 30, 2018, we relied on two key customers for a total of 52.9% of our net sales. One of these customers accounted for 37.3% and the other for 15.6% of our total net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2018. These same customers accounted for 40.6% and 8.8% of total net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2018.  

 Gross Profit  

 Gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased slightly to $6.3 million, compared to $6.2 million for the same period in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit increased 4% or $0.2 million to $5.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 compared $5.4 million for the same period in 2017 due to the impact of the higher net sales discussed above, partially offset by lower gross profit margin. TechXtend segment gross profit decreased 20% to $0.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 compared to $0.8 million for the same period in the prior year due to the lower net sales discussed above.   

 Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 was 13.2% compared to 16.0% in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin was 12.8% for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, compared to 15.6% in 2017. TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 was 17.6%, compared to 19.2% in 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily caused by lower gross profit margins as a percent of net sales for hardware and software product sales which are reported on a gross basis and a change in the percentage mix of our products which are recorded net of the related cost of sales. During the three months ended September 30, 2018 approximately 8.0% of our net sales was attributable to security, maintenance and third-party service products which are recorded on a net basis, or an effective 100% gross profit margin, compared to 8.9% in 2017. This shift in product mix had the effect of reducing gross profit as a percent of net sales by 100 basis points. The remainder of the decline was caused by lower gross profit margin on software and hardware products recorded on a gross basis, as growth in these products was primarily from high volume lines which are sold at lower gross profit margin than our average gross profit. We operate in a competitive environment where the trend has been and may continue to be for gross profit margins as a percentage of adjusted gross billings to decline.   

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  



 Income Taxes  

 For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.4 million, compared to $0.7 million for the same period in 2017. The effective tax rate for ordinary income was 24.2% for the three months ending September 30, 2018, compared to 33.3% during the same period in the prior year.   

 Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the TCJA we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of September 30, 2018. As we collect and prepare necessary data and interpret the TCJA and any additional guidance issued by the Internal 


 Table of Contents  

Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which adjustments are made. The accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will be completed in 2018.  

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017  

 Net Sales  

 Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased 14%, or $16.2 million, to $132.4 million, compared to $116.1 million for the same period in 2017. Adjusted gross billings for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased 16%, or $53.2 million, to $375.6 million, compared to $322.4 million for the same period in 2017.   

 Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $15.4 million, or 15% to $119.3 million, compared to $103.9 million for the same period a year earlier. The increase was due primarily to growth in sales penetration for several of our more significant product lines, the addition of several new product lines, as well as product mix resulting in an increased percent of our sales being reported on a gross basis. The increases were partially offset by turnover in some vendor and customer accounts, including the termination of one of our vendor distribution agreements that accounted for less than 10% of net sales. While the tenure of our vendor relationships is generally for multiple years, the contractual terms of the distribution agreements themselves are short term in nature and vendors consolidate or change their relationships for various reasons. We operate in a competitive market in which vendor distribution and sales agreements are subject to turnover due to competitive bidding processes and other factors. Approximately 9.3% of our net sales were recorded on a net basis compared to 10.1% in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted gross billings for the Lifeboat Distribution segment increased $42.7 million or 14% to $343.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Adjusted gross billings increased at a lower rate than net sales due to the impact of recording sales for certain products net of the related cost of sales.  

 TechXtend segment net sales increased $0.8 million or 7% to $13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $12.3 million for the prior year. Sales in our TechXtend segment may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of IT spending decisions by our larger customers and internal capital allocation decisions regarding capital we allocate to the extended payment program. Adjusted gross billings for the TechXtend segment increased $10.5 million or 48% to $32.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.   

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we relied on two key customers for a total of 44.0% of our net sales. One major customer accounted for 27.5% and the other for 16.5%, of our total net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. These same customers accounted for 40.6% and 8.8% of total net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2018.  

 Gross Profit  

 Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased slightly to $19.7 million, compared to $19.6 million for the same period in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit increased 1% or $0.2 million to $17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared $16.9 million for the same period in 2017 due to higher net sales which were partially offset by the impact of lower gross margin as a percentage of net sales (discussed below). TechXtend segment gross profit decreased 4% to $2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $2.7 million for the same period in the prior year due to the decreased net sales discussed above.   

 Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was 14.9% compared to 16.9% in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin was 14.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to 16.2% in 2017. TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was 19.9%, compared to 22.1% in 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily caused by lower gross profit margins on hardware and software products and a change in the percentage mix of our products which are recorded net of the related cost of sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 approximately 9.3% of our net sales was attributable to security, maintenance and third-party service products which are recorded on a net basis, or an effective 100% gross profit margin, compared to 10.1% in 2017. This shift in product mix had the effect of reducing gross profit as a percent of net sales by 80 basis points. The remainder of the decline was caused by lower gross profit margin on software and hardware products recorded on a gross basis, as growth in these products was primarily from high volume 


 Table of Contents  

lines which are sold at lower gross profit margin than our average gross profit. We operate in a competitive environment where the trend has been and may continue to be for gross profit margins as a percentage of adjusted gross billings to decline.   

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  



 Separation Expense  

 Separation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $2.4 million compared to no expense in the same period in 2017. The increase is due to $2.4 million in separation expenses related to the resignation of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on May 11, 2018, consisting of a $1.7 million charge for accelerated vesting of restricted stock and $0.8 million in accrued payments to be made over the next twelve months.   

 Income Taxes  

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.0 million, compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2017. The company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was impacted by limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation resulting from section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and adjustments to the accrual for state income taxes in states which have enacted economic nexus statutes. The Company recorded a $0.4 million tax benefit related to separation expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 which were accounted for as a discrete item, resulting in a 18% effective tax benefit rate on that expense. We also adjusted our provision for state income taxes in states with economic nexus statutes by $0.2. The effective tax rate for ordinary income was 24.2% for the nine months ending September 30, 2018, compared to 32.2% during the same period in the prior year.   

 Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the TCJA we have made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of September 30, 2018. As we collect and prepare necessary data and interpret the TCJA and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which adjustments are made. The accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will be completed in 2018.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $1.0 million to $6.5 million at September 30, 2018 from $5.5 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in cash was primarily the result of $4.6 million in cash provided by operating activities offset by $3.3 million of cash used for dividends and stock repurchases.  

 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $4.6 million, comprised primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items of $4.8 million, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.2 million. Net cash provided by changes in working capital increased slightly as increases in accounts receivables were offset by lower inventory and utilization of vendor prepayments.  

 In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million, compared to $0.3 million in the prior year.

 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $3.3 million was comprised of $2.3 million of dividend payments on our Common Stock, and $1.0 million for the stock repurchases.   

 On November 15, 2017, the Company entered into a $20,000 revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) pursuant to a Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Loan Note (the “Note”), Second Amended and Restated Security Agreement (the “Security Agreement”) and Second Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement (the “Pledge Agreement”). The Credit Facility, which will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, matures on August 31, 2020, at which time the Company must pay all outstanding principal of all outstanding loans plus all accrued and unpaid interest, and any interest, fees, costs and expenses, if any. As of September 30, 2018, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility.  

 We anticipate that our working capital needs will increase as we invest in the growth of our business. We believe that the funds held in cash and cash equivalents and our unused borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.  



   (1)    Operating leases relate primarily to the leases of the space used for our operations in Eatontown, New Jersey, Mesa Arizona, Mississauga, Canada and Amsterdam, Netherlands. The commitments for operating leases include the minimum rent payments. 

 As of September 30, 2018, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under our lines of credit and no commitments relating to standby letters of credit, and has no standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments (see Note 8 in the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).  

 Foreign Exchange  

 The Company’s foreign subsidiaries are subject to changes in demand or pricing resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors. We are subject to fluctuations primarily in the Canadian Dollar and the Euro Dollar to-U.S. Dollar exchange rate.  

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 As of September 30, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.  

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

 In addition to its activities in the United States, 10.5% of the Company sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 were generated by its subsidiaries in Canada and Europe. We are subject to general risks attendant to the conduct of business in Canada and Europe, including economic uncertainties and foreign government regulations. In addition, the Company’s international business is subject to changes in demand or pricing resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors. See “Item 2 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Foreign Exchange.”  

 The Company’s cash balance is invested in short-term savings accounts with our primary banks, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase Bank. As such, we believe that the risk of significant changes in the value of our cash invested is minimal.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures”, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of various members of our management, including our Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer), Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), and Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer (principal accounting officer). Based upon that evaluation, we have identified a material weakness in our controls over financial reporting that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

 Based on the material weaknesses described below, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  

 The weaknesses we identified relate to several deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of controls over financial reporting that we reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, that in the aggregate constitute a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. Management performed additional procedures to determine the impact of these issues and determined that any errors resulting from the deficiencies above were immaterial individually and in the aggregate, to the Company’s current and previously issued financial statements.   


   ·    Hire and train appropriate personnel or professionals sufficient to manage the complexity, timing, and ever changing nature of our business and financial reporting requirements.  

   ·    Retain and evaluate the qualifications and performance of experts who are engaged to assist in the evaluation and adoption of accounting and tax matters where appropriate. The Company has retained an accounting firm to advise with state income tax compliance requirements. 

   ·    Ensure controls are properly designed and documented to address risks and train key process owners and other relevant personnel to perform timely reconciliations with appropriate documentation and review procedures. The Company has retained outside advisors to assist in the documentation of controls and account reconciliation processes and has implemented enhanced procedures related to the review and documentation of account analysis. The Company is currently testing the performance of these procedures with its outside advisors. 

 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

 In January 2018, we implemented certain internal controls over financial reporting in connection with our adoption of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
