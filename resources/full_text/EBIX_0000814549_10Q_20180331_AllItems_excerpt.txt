Ebix, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements





The Company is continuing to evaluate the classification of the 2017 acquisitions that collectively make up the EbixCash Financial Exchanges, refer to Part I, Item I Business in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Currently these acquisitions are reported under the Exchange channel, but this classification is subject to change based on the conclusions of our continued evaluations.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation—The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and these notes have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") with the effect of inter-company balances and transactions eliminated. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC rules have been condensed or omitted as permitted by and pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) necessary to fairly present the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated results of operations and cash flows. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future quarters or the full year of 2018. The condensed consolidated December 31, 2017 balance sheet included in this interim period filing has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not necessarily include all of the information and related notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Restricted Cash- As part of the ItzCash Card Limited ("ItzCash") acquisition, $4.0 million of the possible future contingent earn-out payments is being held in escrow accounts for the twelve month period following the effective date of the acquisition to ensure that the acquired business achieves the minimum specified annual gross revenue threshold, which if not achieved will result in said funds being returned to Ebix. Additionally, as part of the Wdev Solucoes em Technologia SA ("Wdev") acquisition, upfront cash consideration is being held in an escrow account for the thirty-eight month period following the effective date of the acquisition to ensure that the acquired business achieves the minimum specified annual net revenue threshold, which if not achieved will result in said funds being returned to Ebix. As of March 31, 2018 there is $3.0 million included in other long-term assets of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.



 Advertising—Advertising costs amounted to $1.5 million and $1.5 million in the first three months of 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Under legacy US GAAP 340-20, direct response advertising was eligible for capitalization if certain conditions were met. During the first three months of 2017 reported sales and marketing expenses included $1.0 million of amortization of certain direct-response advertising costs associated with our medical education services, which have been capitalized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 340. These costs were previously amortized to advertising expense over periods ranging from twelve to twenty-four months based on the type of product the customer purchased. Effective January 1, 2018 Subtopic 340-40 replaced that guidance to require the costs of direct-response advertising to be expensed as they are incurred or the first time the advertising takes place. The Company was required to recognize a cumulative effective change to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption of the standard. The Company recorded a one-time $1.9 million adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2018 and is expensing all future costs from this date forward. Under the new guidance Subtopic 340-40, the Company's expense increased by $217 thousand during the first three months of 2018 from what would have been recorded under legacy US GAAP 340-20.


•Level 1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for identical investments to the reporting entity at the measurement date.

•Level 2 Inputs - Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

•Level 3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs, which are used to the extent that observable inputs are not available, and used in situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability and wherein the reporting entity makes estimates and assumptions related to the pricing of the asset or liability including assumptions regarding risk.

 A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.


•Short-term investments (commercial bank certificates of deposits and mutual funds), for which the fair values are measured as a Level 1 instrument.

•Contingent accrued earn-out business acquisition consideration liabilities for which fair values are measured as Level 3 instruments. These contingent consideration liabilities were recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and are re-measured quarterly based on the then assessed fair value and adjusted if necessary. The increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration payable can result from changes in anticipated revenue levels and changes in assumed discount periods and rates. As the fair value measure is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, they are categorized as Level 3.







Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements




Sensitivity to Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs

As presented in the table above, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration related to business acquisitions are projected revenue forecasts as developed by the relevant members of Company's management team and the probability of achievement of those revenue forecasts. Significant increases (decreases) in these unobservable inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. The Company applies these terms in its calculation and determination of the fair value of contingent earn out liabilities for purchased businesses as part of the related valuation and purchase price allocation exercise for the corresponding acquired assets and liabilities. During 2017, certain of the Company's contingent earn out liabilities were adjusted because of changes to anticipated future revenues from these acquired businesses, or as a result of finalizing purchase price allocations that were previously provisional.

Revenue Recognition—In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, “Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net),” which amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and in April 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, “Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,” which amends the guidance in those areas in the new revenue recognition standard.

The Company derives its revenues primarily from subscription and transaction fees pertaining to services delivered over our exchanges or from our application service provider ("ASP") platforms, fees for risk compliance solution services, and fees for software development projects including associated fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems and applications. Sales and value-added taxes are not included in revenues, but rather are recorded as a liability until the taxes assessed are remitted to the respective taxing authorities. 

Under Topic 606, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.


• identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

• identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

• determination of the transaction price;

• allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

• recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.

For contracts that contain multiple deliverables, we analyze the revenue arrangements in accordance with the relevant technical accounting guidance, which provides criteria governing how to determine whether goods or services that are delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be considered as separate performance obligations for the purpose of revenue recognition. These types of arrangements include obligations pertaining to software licenses, system set-up, and professional services associated with product customization or modification. Delivery of the various contractual obligations typically occurs over periods of less than eighteen months. These arrangements generally do not have refund provisions or have very limited refund terms. 

Software development arrangements involving significant customization, modification or production are accounted for in accordance with the appropriate technical accounting guidance issued by FASB using the percentage-of-completion method. The Company recognizes revenue using periodic reported actual hours worked as a percentage of total expected hours required to complete the project arrangement and applies the percentage to the total arrangement fee.

Financial exchange revenue consists largely of transaction-based fees and fees from corporate and retail gift vouchers. The transaction-based fees are primarily based on a percentage of payment value processed for solutions such as retail and corporate payments, domestic money transfers, and general purpose reloadable cards. Transaction-based fees are recognized at the completion of the transaction. Gift voucher revenue is recognized at full purchase value at time of sale with the corresponding cost of vouchers recorded under direct expenses.

The Company adopted the new revenue recognition standard as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method and applying the new standard to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Therefore, the comparative financial information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. 

The adoption resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of $11.6 million for the cumulative effect of applying the Topic 606. This decrease was principally driven by the deferral of certain services revenues associated with programming, setup, and implementation activities related to our SaaS offering and changes related to costs to obtain customers, including the related amortization period.

Impact of New Revenue Recognition Standard on Financial Statement Line Items





Disaggregation of Revenue



See Note 7 for additional geographic information



Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract

The Company capitalizes certain costs to obtain and fulfill a new contract and contract renewals. These costs are primarily related to the setup and customization of our SaaS based platforms and are amortized over the benefit period. Under our treatment prior to implementing Topic 606, these costs were expensed as incurred. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $870 thousand of contract costs in “Other current assets” and $1.4 million in “Other Assets” on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.


Deferred Revenue

The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments or invoices in advance of the performance of services. A significant portion of this balance relates to contracts where the customer has paid in advance for the use of our SaaS platforms over a specified period of time. This portion is recognized as the related performance obligation is fulfilled, generally less than one year. The remaining portion of the deferred revenue balance consists primarily of customer specific customizations that are not distinct from related performance obligations that transfer over time. This portion is recognized over the expected useful life of the customizations.


Practical Expedients and Exemptions

We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed, and (iii) contracts from periods prior to the application of Topic 606.

Income Taxes

The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in an increase to deferred revenue, which in turn generated an additional deferred tax asset that increased the Company’s net deferred tax asset position. 

Accounts Receivable and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts—Reported accounts receivable include $85.4 million of trade receivables stated at invoice billed amounts and $32.0 million of unbilled receivables (net of the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts receivable in the amount of $5.1 million.) The unbilled receivables pertain to certain projects for which the timing of billing is tied to contractual milestones. The Company is continuing to evaluate the 2017 and first quarter 2018 acquisitions that collectively make up the EbixCash Financial Exchanges, refer to Part I, Item I Business in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and their impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company adheres to such contractually stated performance milestones and accordingly issues invoices to customers as per contract billing schedules. Approximately $7.8 million of deferred revenue is included in billed accounts receivable at March 31, 2018. During the three months ending March 31, 2018 and 2017 the Company recognized and recorded bad debt expense in the amount of $1.0 million and $407 thousand, respectively. Accounts receivable are written off against the allowance account when the Company has exhausted all reasonable collection efforts. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, $40 thousand and $82 thousand, respectively, of accounts receivable, which had been specifically reserved for in prior periods, were written off. 

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets—Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent the fair value of certain acquired contractual customer relationships for which future cash flows are expected to continue indefinitely. In accordance with the relevant FASB accounting guidance, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would likely have reduced the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Potential impairment indicators include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, and the sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. The impairment evaluation process involves an assessment of certain qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount. If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we were to determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the Company would not perform the two-step quantitative impairment testing described further below.

The aforementioned two-step quantitative testing process involves comparing the reporting unit carrying values to their respective fair values; we determine fair value of our reporting units by applying the discounted cash flow method using the present value of future estimated net cash flows. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then no further testing is required. However, if a reporting unit's fair value were to be less than its carrying value, we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any, which would be the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeded its implied value. Projections of cash flows are based on our views of growth rates, operating costs, anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. The use of different estimates or assumptions for our projected discounted cash flows (e.g., growth rates, future economic conditions, discount rates and estimates of terminal values) when determining the fair value of our reporting units could result in different values and may result in a goodwill impairment charge.

In 2017 the goodwill residing in the Exchange reporting unit, the RCS reporting unit, and the Carrier reporting unit were evaluated for impairment using step-one of the quantitative testing process described above. The fair value of three of these reporting units were found to be greater than their carrying value, and thus step-two of the quantitative testing process described above became unnecessary because no impairment was indicated. In specific regards to the RCS reporting unit, its assessed fair value was was $158.0 million which was $42.4 million or 36.7% in excess of its $115.6 million carrying value. Key assumptions used in the fair value determination were annual revenue growth of 7.5% to 12.5% and discount rate of 16%. As of September 30, 2017 there was $78.2 million of goodwill assigned to the RCS reporting unit. A significant reduction in future revenues for the RCS reporting unit would negatively affect the fair value determination for this unit and may result in an impairment to goodwill and a corresponding charge against earnings. We perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and testing as of September 30th of each year. This evaluation is performed during the fourth quarter each year. During the year ended December 31, 2017 we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances. 

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017 are reflected in the following table.


 Capitalized Software Development Costs—In accordance with the relevant FASB accounting guidance regarding the development of software to be sold, leased, or marketed, the Company expenses such costs as they are incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at and after which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Costs incurred to enhance our software products, after general market release of the services using the products, are expensed in the period they are incurred.





Amortization expense recognized in connection with acquired intangible assets was $2.0 million and $1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation—The functional currency for the Company's foreign subsidiaries in India, Dubai, and Singapore is the U.S. dollar because the intellectual property research and development activities provided by its Dubai and Singapore subsidiaries, and the product development and information technology enabled services activities for the insurance industry provided by its India subsidiary, both in support of the Company's operating divisions across the world, are transacted in U.S. dollars.

The functional currency of the Company's other foreign subsidiaries is the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates. The assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet dates. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses resulting from translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and are included in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses that are derived from transactions denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary's functional currency are included in the determination of net income.

Income Taxes—Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets, liabilities, operating losses, and tax credit carry forwards using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Valuation allowances, if any, are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management considers more likely than not to be realized. Such valuation allowances are recorded for the portion of 

the deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized based on the levels of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences will be deductible.

The Company also applies the relevant FASB accounting guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes positions. This guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. In this regard we recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.



In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment". To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the FASB eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities). Instead, under the amendments in this ASU, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. A public business entity filer should adopt the amendments in this ASU for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company has yet to assess the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on Ebix's consolidated income statement and balance sheet.

In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, "Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business" which amended the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The standard provides additional guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting, including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted. The Company has yet to assess the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on Ebix's consolidated income statement and balance sheet

In November 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, "Statement of Cash Flow (Topic 230) Restricted Cash" amends ASC 230 to add or clarify guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this Update require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this Update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2018 with no material impact to its statement of cash flows. For the three month ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company held $4.0 million and zero, respectively, in "Restricted cash" and $3.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively, in "Other long-term assets" of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.


should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2018 with no material impact to its consolidated financial statements.


In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)". This new accounting guidance is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The ASU affects all companies and other organizations that lease assets such as real estate, airplanes, and manufacturing equipment. The ASU will require organizations that lease assets referred to as “Lessees” to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. An organization is to provide disclosures designed to enable users of financial statements to understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements concerning additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet the new ASU will require both types of leases (i.e., operating and capital) to be recognized on the balance sheet. The FASB lessee accounting model will continue to account for both types of leases. The capital lease will be accounted for in substantially the same manner as capital leases are accounted for under existing GAAP. For operating leases there will have to be the recognition of a lease liability and a lease asset for all such leases greater than one year in term. The leasing standard will be effective for calendar year-end public companies beginning after December 15, 2018. Public companies will be required to adopt the new leasing standard for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for all companies and organizations. For calendar year-end public companies, this means an adoption date of January 1, 2019 and retrospective application to previously issued annual and interim financial statements for 2018 and 2017. Lessees with a large portfolio of leases are likely to see a significant increase in balance sheet assets and liabilities. See Note 5 for the Company’s current lease commitments. The Company is evaluating the impact that this new leasing ASU will have on its financial statements.





 The Company seeks to execute accretive business acquisitions (which primarily targets businesses that are complementary to Ebix's existing products and services), in combination with organic growth initiatives, as part of its comprehensive business growth and expansion strategy. 




Effective November 1, 2017 Ebix acquired Via.com ("Via"), a recognized leader in the travel space in India and an Omni-channel online travel and assisted e-commerce exchange. Ebix acquired Via for upfront cash consideration in the amount $78.8 million plus possible future contingent payments of up to $2.3 million based on any potential claims made by tax authorities over the subsequent twelve month period following the effective date of the acquisition and $2.0 million based on the receipt of refunds pertaining to certain advance tax payments and withholding taxes, both of which are included in "Other current liabilities" in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation and purchase price allocation for the Via acquisition remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.

Effective November 1, 2017 Ebix acquired the MTSS Business of Paul Merchants, the largest international remittance service provider in India, for upfront cash consideration in the amount $37.4 million. The valuation and purchase price allocation for the Paul Merchants acquisition remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.

Effective October 1, 2017 Ebix acquired the MTSS Business of Wall Street, an inward international remittance service provider in India, along with the acquisition of its subsidiary company Goldman Securities Limited for upfront cash consideration in the amount $7.4 million. The valuation and purchase price allocation for the Wall Street acquisition remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.

On August 18 2017 Ebix entered into an agreement to acquire MTSS Business of YouFirst Money Express Private Limited ("YouFirst") for upfront cash consideration in the amount $10.2 million. The acquisition, effective September 1, 2017, was funded in October following the securing of requisite approvals for the closing. The valuation and purchase price allocation for the 

YouFirst acquisition remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.

Effective June 1, 2017 Ebix acquired the assets of beBetter Health, Inc., ("beBetter"), a technology enabled corporate wellness provider that provides end-to-end wellness solutions offering a variety of tools and programs, including interactive platforms, health screening, coaching, tobacco cessation, weight and stress management, health information, and numerous other products and services. Ebix acquired the assets and intellectual property of beBetter for $1.0 million plus possible future contingent earn-out payments of up to $2.0 million based on earned revenues over the subsequent twenty-four month period following the effective date of the acquisition. 

Effective April 1, 2017 Ebix entered into a joint venture with India-based Essel Group, while acquiring an 80% stake in ItzCash Card Limited ("ItzCash"), India’s leading payment solutions exchange. ItzCash is recognized as a leader in the prepaid cards and bill payments space in India. Under the terms of the agreement, ItzCash was valued at a total enterprise value of approximately $150 million. Accordingly, Ebix acquired an 80% stake in ItzCash for $120 million including upfront cash of $76.3 million plus possible future contingent earn-out payments of up to $44.0 million based on earned revenues over the subsequent thirty-six month period following the effective date of the acquisition. $4.0 million of the possible future contingent earn-out payments is being held in escrow accounts for the twelve month period following the effective date of the acquisition to ensure that the acquired business achieves the minimum specified annual gross revenue threshold, which if not achieved will result in said funds being returned to Ebix. The Company has determined that the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration is $34.0 million as of March 31, 2018. The valuation and purchase price allocation for the ItzCash acquisition remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.


 Consideration paid by the Company for the businesses it purchases is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Recognized goodwill pertains to the value of the expected synergies to be derived from combining the operations of the businesses we acquire including the value of the acquired workforce. 

The aggregated unaudited pro forma financial information pertaining to all of the Company's acquisitions that have an impact on the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, which includes the acquisitions of the ItzCash (acquired April 2017), beBetter (acquired June 2017), YouFirst (acquired September 2017), WallStreet (acquired October 2017), Paul Merchants (acquired November 2017), Via (acquired November 2017) and Transcorp (acquired February 2018) and as presented in the table below is provided for informational purposes only and is not a projection of the Company's expected results of operations for any future period. No effect has been given in this pro forma information for future synergistic benefits that may still be realized as a result of combining these companies or costs that may yet be incurred in integrating their operations. The 2018 and 2017 pro forma financial information below assumes that all such business acquisitions were made on January 1, 2017, whereas the Company's reported financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2018 only include the operating results from these businesses since the effective date that they were acquired by Ebix.

On February 21, 2018, Ebix, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Sixth Amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) to the Regions Secured Credit Facility, dated August 5, 2014, among the Company, Regions Bank as Administrative and Collateral Agent ("Regions") and certain other lenders party thereto (as amended, the "Credit Agreement"). The Sixth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement by increasing its existing credit facility from $450 million to $650 million, to assist in funding its growth. The increase in the bank line was the result of many members of the existing bank group expanding their share of the credit facility and the addition of BBVA Compass and Bank West to the Banking Syndicate, which diversifies Ebix’s lending group under the credit facility to ten participants.The syndicated bank group now comprises ten leading financial institutions that include Regions Bank, PNC Bank, BMO Harris Bank, BBVA Compass, Fifth Third Bank, KeyBank, Bank West, Silicon Valley Bank, Cadence Bank and Trustmark National Bank. Regions Bank continued to lead the banking group while serving as the administrative and collateral agent. PNC Bank and BMO Harris Bank were added as co syndication agents, BBVA Compass and Fifth Third Bank as co documentation agent, while Regions Capital Markets, PNC Capital Markets and BMO Harris Bank acted as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners. The new credit facility has the following key components; A five-year term loan for $250 million, 

with initial repayments starting June 30, 2018 due in the amount $3.13 million for the first eight quarters and increasing thereafter and a five-year revolving credit facility for $400 million. The new credit facility, also, allows for up to $150 million of incremental facilities. The Credit Agreement carries a leverage-based LIBOR related interest rate, which currently stands at approximately 3.88%. 

On November 3, 2017 the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Fifth Amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to exercise $50 million of its aggregate $100 million accordion option, increasing the total Term Loan Commitment to $175 million. $20 million of the increase was funded on November 3, 2017 and the remaining $30 million shall be disbursed upon the satisfaction of certain closing requirements set forth in the Fifth Amendment. Both such disbursements are tied to permitted acquisitions as set forth in the Fifth Amendment.

On November 3, 2017, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Fourth Amendment and Waiver (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment waives certain technical defaults related to the failure to give required notice with respect to i) the existence of a subsidiary having intellectual property with an aggregate value above a stipulated amount and ii) the additional investment in a joint venture entity resulting in that entity becoming a subsidiary of the Company for the purpose of the Credit Agreement. In addition to such waiver, the Fourth Amendment also loosened the leverage ratios the Company is required to satisfy in connection with permitted acquisitions and for compliance generally.

On October 19, 2017, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Third Amendment and Waiver (the “Third Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment waives certain technical defaults related to the Company’s making certain restricted payments in excess of those permitted under the Credit Agreement. In addition to such waiver, the Third Amendment also loosened the limitations on the restricted payment covenant under the Credit Agreement.

On June 17, 2016, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Second Amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement, Regions Capital Markets, PNC Capital Markets, LLC, and TD Securities (USA) as joint Lead Arrangers for the syndicate of lenders (the “Regions Secured Credit Facility”). The Second Amendment increases the total credit facility to $400 million from the prior amount of $240 million, and expands the syndicated bank group to eleven participants by adding seven new participants which include PNC Bank, National Association BMO Harris Bank N.A., Key Bank National Association, HSBC Bank National, Cadence Bank, the Toronto-Dominion Bank (New York Branch), and Trustmark National Bank. The Credit Agreement now consists of a five-year revolving credit component in the amount of $275 million, and a five-year term loan component in the amount of $125 million, with repayments due in the amount $3.13 million due each quarter, starting September 30, 2016 . The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature, which if exercised and approved by all credit parties, would expand the total borrowing capacity under the syndicated credit facility to $500 million.

As of March 31, 2018 the Company's consolidated balance sheet includes $5.7 million of remaining deferred financing costs in connection with this credit facility, which are being amortized as a component of interest expense over the five-year term of the financing agreement. In regards to these deferred financing costs, $3.5 million pertains to the revolving line of credit component of the Credit Agreement, and $2.2 million pertains to the term loan component of the Credit Agreement of which $449 thousand is netted against the current portion and $1.7 million is netted against the long-term portions of the term loan as reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance.

At March 31, 2018, the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement was $173.7 million and the facility carried an interest rate of 3.88%. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, $20.0 million of draws were made off of the revolving credit facility. The revolving line of credit balance is included in the long-term liabilities section of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the average and maximum outstanding balances of the revolving line of credit component of the credit facility were $224.2 million and $274.5 million, respectively.

At March 31, 2018, the outstanding balance on the term loan was $250.0 million of which $12.5 million is due within the next twelve months, with no payments having been made during the three months ended March 31, 2018. This term loan also carried an interest rate of 3.88%. The current and long-term portions of the term loan are included in the respective current and long-term sections of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, the amounts of which were $12.5 million and $237.5 million respectively at March 31, 2018. 




The Company is involved in various other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate likely disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Lease Commitments—The Company leases office space under non-cancelable operating leases with expiration dates ranging through 2029, with various renewal options. Capital leases range from three to five years and are primarily for computer equipment. There were multiple assets under various individual capital leases at March 31, 2018 and 2017. Rental expense for office facilities and certain equipment subject to operating leases for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1.9 million and $790 thousand (net of a $(948) thousand purchase accounting adjustment), respectively.


contingent liabilities was $36.5 million, of which $32.5 million is reported in long-term liabilities, and $4.0 million is included in current liabilities in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2017, the total of these contingent liabilities was $37.1 million, of which $33.1 million is reported in long-term liabilities, and $4.0 million is included in current liabilities in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Self-Insurance—For some of the Company’s U.S. employees the Company is self-insured for its health insurance program and has a stop loss policy that limits the individual liability to $120 thousand per person and the aggregate liability to 125% of the expected claims based upon the number of participants and historical claims. As of March 31, 2018, the amount accrued on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet for the self-insured component of the Company’s employee health insurance was $332 thousand. The maximum potential estimated cumulative liability for the annual contract period, which ends in September 2019, was $2.8 million.


The Company recorded income tax expense of $2.13 million (7.44%) during the three months ended March 31, 2018 , which included discrete items for additions to the reserve for uncertain tax positions. The income tax expense exclusive of discrete items for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is $2.10 million (7.33%). Our tax expense and effective tax rate increased year over year, exclusive of discrete charges, due to a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by foreign subsidiaries as part of the Tax Act. The Company expects its full year tax rate before discrete items to be approximately 7.35%.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Act, which implemented a number of changes that took effect on January 1, 2018, including but not limited to, a new minimum tax on GILTI earned by foreign subsidiaries. The Company estimated the impact of GILTI on the expected annual effective income tax rate and recorded a provisional tax expense. Any adjustment of the Company’s provisional tax expense will be reflected as a change in estimate in its results in the period in which the change in estimate is made in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is also included in ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 issued March 2018. In addition, the Company continues to gather information to compute the amount of the Transition Tax under the Tax Act and expects to finalize its calculation prior to filing its U.S. federal tax return, which is due October 15, 2018.

The Company’s effective tax rate reflects the benefits of having significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the US statutory rate of 21% and where the Company enjoys a tax holiday in India. During 2015, the Company secured an additional tax holiday in India until the year 2020 to support certain portions of its expanding operations there. The Company, also, had income during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 in the United Kingdom, Dubai, and Sweden, where the statutory tax rates are lower than the US rate of 21%.

As of March 31, 2018 a liability of $9.2 million for uncertain tax positions is included in other long-term liabilities of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 there was $30 thousand in additions to this liability reserve. During the same periods in 2017, there were $518 thousand in additions to this liability reserve. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense.



During the first three months of 2018 the United States' revenues decreased $2.3 million due primarily to a combination of decreased professional services and a seasonal decrease of continuing medical education services. Canada's revenues decreased by $508 thousand due primarily to decreased professional services. Latin America's revenues increased $1.5 million due primarily due to increased professional services. Australia's revenues increased by $588 thousand primarily due to a combination of increased professional services and transaction fees, and a $340 thousand increase due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. India's revenue increased $26.4 million of which $1.2 million is due to the various new e-governance contracts with a number of large 

clients and $25.0 million due to its 2017 acquisitions of ItzCash (Q2 2017), YouFirst (Q3 2017), Wall Street (Q4 2017), Paul Merchants (Q4 2017), Via (Q4 2017) and the Q1 2018 acquisition of Transcorp. Increases in Indonesia, Philippines and United Arab Emirates are due to the November 2017 acquisition of Via.



In the geographical information table above the significant changes to long-lived assets from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018 were comprised of an increase in the United States of $8.0 million primarily due to capitalized continuing medical education product costs and the continued build out of our global corporate headquarters campus in Johns Creek, Georgia. A decrease in Latin America of $1.9 million primarily due to a 4.8% weakening of the Brazilian Real versus the U.S. Dollar which caused a $1.2 million decrease in the translation of long-lived assets and amortization of intangible assets. An increase in India of $257.3 million is primarily due to a $253.2 million increase associated with the 2017 acquisitions of ItzCash (Q2 2017), YouFirst (Q3 2017), Wall Street (Q4 2017), Paul Merchants (Q4 2017), Via (Q4 2017) and the Q1 2018 acquisition of Transcorp. The Europe increase of $5.6 million is primarily due to a 12.2% strengthening of the British Pound Sterling versus the U.S. Dollar which caused a $2.7 million increase in the translation of long-lived assets, an increase in deferred tax assets of $4.3 million primarily due to the release of valuation allowances of operating loss carryforwards, partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets and capitalized software development costs.


Effective January 2, 2018 Paul Merchants acquired a 10% equity interest in Ebix’s combined international remittance business in India (comprised of YouFirst, Wall Street , Paul Merchants, and Transcorp) for cash consideration of $5.0 million. The consolidation of these acquisitions into Ebix's Financial Exchange operations will bring synergies and reduce certain redundancies to the combined operation. As part of this agreement Ebix retains an irrevocable option to reacquire 10% of the equity interest after one year at a predetermined price which is included in other current liabilities of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Effective April 1, 2017 Ebix entered into a joint venture with India-based Essel Group, while acquiring an 80% stake in ItzCash, India’s leading payment solutions exchange. ItzCash is recognized as a leader in the prepaid cards and bill payments space in India. Under the terms of the agreement, ItzCash was valued at a total enterprise value of approximately $150 million. Accordingly, Ebix acquired an 80% stake in ItzCash for $120 million including upfront cash of $76.3 million plus possible future 

contingent earn-out payments of up to $44.0 million based on earned revenues over the subsequent thirty-six month period following the effective date of the acquisition. $4.0 million of the possible future contingent earn-out payments is being held in escrow accounts for the twelve month period following the effective date of the acquisition to ensure that the acquired business achieves the minimum specified annual gross revenue threshold, which if not achieved will result in said funds being returned to Ebix. The valuation and purchase price allocation for the ItzCash acquisition remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year.

IHC contributed all if its shares in its existing third party administrator operations (IHC Health Solutions, Inc.), valued by the EbixHealth JV at $12.0 million for its 60% membership interest in the EbixHealth JV, and received a special distribution of $6.0 million. Effective July 1, 2016 Ebix and IHC jointly executed a Call Notice agreement, whereby Ebix purchased additional common units in the EbixHealth JV from IHC constituting eleven percent (11%) of the EbixHealth JV for $2.0 million cash which resulted in Ebix holding an aggregate fifty-one percent (51%) of the EbixHealth JV. Commensurate with additional equity stake in the joint venture and a new contemporaneous valuation of the business the Company realized a $1.2 million gain on its previously carried 40% equity interest in the EbixHealth JV. This recognized gain was reflected as a component of other non-operating income in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. Beginning July 1, 2016 Ebix is fully consolidating the operations of the EbixHealth JV into the Company's financial statements and separately reporting the IHC minority, non-controlling, 49% interest in the joint venture's net income and equity, and thereby reflecting Ebix's net resulting 51% interest in the EbixHealth JV profits or losses.

Credit Risk

The Company is potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk in its accounts receivable. Credit risk is the risk of an

unexpected loss if a customer fails to meet its contractual obligations.

Reported general and administrative expenses increased $6.8 million or 54% to $19.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $12.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to costs associated with the business acquisitions of ItzCash,Via, YouFirst, WallStreet and Paul Merchants, a $1.1 million increase in professional fees, a $948 thousand purchase accounting adjustment in 2017, and a $638 thousand increase in bad debt expense. 

Amortization and Depreciation Expenses

Amortization and depreciation expenses decreased $48 thousand or 2% to $2.81 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $2.86 million in the first quarter of 2017.

Interest Income

Interest income decreased $653 thousand or 84% to $121 thousand in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $774 thousand in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to interest now recorded as revenue in India and a reduction in the average cash balances in interest bearing accounts.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased $2.4 million or 96%, to $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Interest expense increased primarily due to the increase in the average outstanding balance on our commercial banking credit facilities, which increased 44% to $402.4 million during Q1 2018 from $278.9 million during Q1 of 2017, as well as an increase in the underlying average interest rate which increased to 4.3% for Q1 2018 versus 3.1% for Q1 2017.

Foreign Currency Exchange Gain (Loss)

Net foreign currency exchange losses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 in the amount of $641 thousand consists of $222 thousand of losses realized upon the settlement of receivables or payables and re-measurement of cash balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective operating division recording the instrument, and $419 thousand of unrealized losses pertaining to the re-measurement of outstanding receivables or payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective operating division recording the instrument.

Income Taxes 

The Company recorded income tax expense of $2.13 million (7.44%) during the three months ended March 31, 2018 , which included discrete items for additions to the reserve for uncertain tax positions. The income tax expense exclusive of discrete items for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is $2.10 million (7.33%). Our tax expense and effective tax rate increased year over year, exclusive of discrete charges, due to a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by foreign subsidiaries as part of the Tax Act. The Company expects its full year tax rate before discrete items to be approximately 7.35%.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Act, which implemented a number of changes that took effect on January 1, 2018, including but not limited to, a new minimum tax on GILTI earned by foreign subsidiaries. The Company estimated the impact of GILTI on the expected annual effective income tax rate and recorded a provisional tax expense. Any adjustment of the Company’s provisional tax expense will be reflected as a change in estimate in its results in the period in which the change in estimate is made in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is also included in ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 issued March 2018. In addition, the Company continues to gather information to compute the 

amount of the Transition Tax under the Tax Act and expects to finalize its calculation prior to filing its U.S. federal tax return, which is due October 15, 2018.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's ability to generate significant cash flows from ongoing operating activities is one of its fundamental financial strengths. Our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows provided by the Company's operating activities, the Company's commercial banking credit facility, and cash and cash equivalents on hand. Due to the effect of temporary or timing differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes (including the treatment of net operating loss carry-forwards and minimum alternative tax obligations in the U.S., Great Britain, and India), future cash outlays for income taxes are expected to exceed income tax expense. We intend to utilize cash flows generated by our operations, in combination with our commercial bank credit facility, and the possible issuance of additional equity or debt securities, to fund capital expenditures and organic growth initiatives, to make strategic and accretive business acquisitions in the insurance services sector, and to re-purchase shares of our common stock as market conditions warrant.

We believe that anticipated cash flows provided by our operating activities, together with current cash and cash equivalent balances, access to our credit facilities, and access to the capital markets, if required and available, will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future, although any projections of future cash needs, cash flows, and the condition of the capital markets in general, as to the availability of debt and equity financing, are subject to substantial uncertainty. 

Our cash and cash equivalents were $111.9 million and $63.9 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The $4.0 million of restricted cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2018 consists of the ItzCash acquisition $4.0 million of the possible future contingent earn-out payments being held in escrow accounts for the twelve month period following the effective date of the acquisition to ensure that the acquired business achieves the minimum specified annual gross revenue threshold, which if not achieved will result in said funds being returned to Ebix. The $8.6 million of restricted fiduciary funds is associated with the EbixHealth JV and pertains to un-remitted insurance premiums and claim funds established for the benefit of various carriers which are held in a fiduciary capacity until disbursed.



 Our current ratio increased to 1.83 at March 31, 2018 from 1.72 at December 31, 2017 and accordingly our working capital position increased to $132.2 million at March 31, 2018 from $106.0 million at the end of 2017. Our short-term liquidity has primarily increased due to increased cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a decrease in short-term investments and increased deferred revenues. The Company's days sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("DSO") was 99 days at March 31, 2018 up 7 

days from 92 days at December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to contracts in Brazil, the US and India that have longer payment terms.

We believe that Ebix's ability to generate sustainable and robust cash flows from operations will enable the Company to continue to fund its current liabilities from current assets including available cash balances for the foreseeable future.

Business Combinations

The Company seeks to execute accretive business acquisitions in combination with organic growth initiatives as part of its comprehensive business growth and expansion strategy. The Company looks to acquire businesses that are complementary to Ebix's existing products and services.

Under the terms of the agreement, ItzCash was valued at a total enterprise value of approximately $150 million. Accordingly, Ebix acquired an 80% stake in ItzCash for $120 million including upfront cash of $76.3 million plus possible future contingent earn-out payments of up to $44.0 million based on earned revenues over the subsequent 

thirty-six month period following the effective date of the acquisition. $4.0 million of the possible future contingent earn-out payments is being held in escrow accounts for the twelve month period following the effective date of the acquisition to ensure that the acquired business achieves the minimum specified annual gross revenue threshold, which if not achieved will result in said funds being returned to Ebix. The Company has determined that the fair value of the contingent earn-out consideration is $34.0 million as of March 31, 2018. The valuation and purchase price allocation for the ItzCash acquisition remains preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable but in no event longer than one year from the effective date of this transaction.


Operating Activities

Net cash provided by our operating activities was $25.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The primary components of the cash provided by our operating activities during the three month period consisted of net income of $26.2 million, net of $419 thousand of unrealized foreign currency exchange gains, $2.8 million of depreciation and amortization, $248 thousand of net income attributable to a non-controlling interest, $753 thousand of non-cash share-based compensation, and $525 thousand of amortization of capitalized software development costs. Partially offsetting this net cash inflow was $(5.5) million of working capital requirements primarily due to increased outstanding trade accounts receivable and other assets and a decrease in deferred revenues. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 the Company made $6.8 million of tax payments including $2.5 million of minimum alternative tax payments in India, which is a component of net deferred tax assets on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

During the three months ended March 31, 2018 net cash provided by financing activities was $21.8 million which consisted of $124.3 million provided by the refinancing and borrowing from the amended and expanded syndicated credit facility with Regions Bank, $20.0 million provided by the Company's revolving credit facility with Regions, $745 thousand provided by the EbixCash overdraft facility in India. Partially offsetting this cash inflow were $120.8 million used as part of the refinancing and borrowing from the amended and expanded syndicated credit facility with Regions Bank and $2.4 million was used to pay quarterly dividends to our common stockholder. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2017 net cash used by financing activities was $6.2 million which consisted of $40.5 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, $2.4 million was used to pay quarterly dividends to our common stockholders, and $3.13 million was used to make the scheduled payments against the existing term loan with Regions. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was $40.0 million provided by the Company's revolving credit facility with Regions.

Commercial Bank Financing Facility

On February 21, 2018, Ebix, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Sixth Amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) to the Regions Secured Credit Facility, dated August 5, 2014, among the Company, Regions Bank as Administrative and Collateral Agent ("Regions") and certain other lenders party thereto (as amended, the "Credit Agreement"). The Sixth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement by increasing its existing credit facility from $450 million to $650 million, to assist in funding its growth. The increase in the bank line was the result of many members of the existing bank group expanding their share of the credit facility and the addition of BBVA Compass and Bank West to the Banking Syndicate, which diversifies Ebix’s lending group under the credit facility to ten participants.The syndicated bank group now comprises ten leading financial institutions that include Regions Bank, PNC Bank, BMO Harris Bank, BBVA Compass, Fifth Third Bank, KeyBank, Bank West, Silicon Valley Bank, Cadence Bank and Trustmark National Bank. Regions Bank continued to lead the banking group while serving as the administrative and collateral agent. PNC Bank and BMO Harris Bank were added as co syndication agents, BBVA Compass and Fifth Third Bank as co documentation agent, while Regions Capital Markets, PNC Capital Markets and BMO Harris Bank acted as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners. The new credit facility has the following key components; A five-year term loan for $250 million, with initial repayments starting June 30, 2018 due in the amount $3.13 million for the first eight quarters and increasing thereafter and a five-year revolving credit facility for $400 million. The new credit facility, also, allows for up to $150 million of incremental facilities. The Credit Agreement carries a leverage-based LIBOR related interest rate, which currently stands at approximately 3.88%. 

On June 17, 2016, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Second Amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement, Regions Capital Markets, PNC Capital Markets, LLC, and TD Securities (USA) as joint Lead Arrangers for the syndicate of lenders (the “Regions Secured Credit Facility”). The Second Amendment increases the total credit facility to $400 million from the prior amount of $240 million, and expands the syndicated bank group to eleven participants by adding seven new participants which include PNC Bank, National Association BMO Harris Bank N.A., Key Bank National Association, HSBC Bank National, Cadence Bank, the Toronto-Dominion Bank (New York Branch), and Trustmark National Bank. The Credit Agreement now consists of a five-year revolving credit component in the amount of $275 million, and a five-year term loan component in the amount of $125 million, with repayments due in the amount $3.13 million due each quarter, starting September 30, 2016 . The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature, which if exercised and approved by all credit parties, would expand the total borrowing capacity under the syndicated credit facility to $500 million.

As of March 31, 2018 the Company's consolidated balance sheet includes $5.7 million of remaining deferred financing costs in connection with this credit facility, which are being amortized as a component of interest expense over the five-year term of the financing agreement. In regards to these deferred financing costs, $3.5 million pertains to the revolving line of credit component of the Credit Agreement, and $2.2 million pertains to the term loan component of the Credit Agreement of which $449 thousand is netted against the current portion and $1.7 million is netted against the long-term portions of the term loan as reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance.

At March 31, 2018, the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement was $173.7 million and the facility carried an interest rate of 3.88%. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, $20.0 million of draws were made off of the revolving credit facility. The revolving line of credit balance is included in the long-term liabilities section of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the average and maximum outstanding balances of the revolving line of credit component of the credit facility were $224.2 million and $274.5 million, respectively.

At March 31, 2018, the outstanding balance on the term loan was $250.0 million of which $12.5 million is due within the next twelve months, with no payments having been made during the three months ended March 31, 2018. This term loan also carried an interest rate of 3.88%. The current and long-term portions of the term loan are included in the respective current and long-term sections of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, the amounts of which were $12.5 million and $237.5 million respectively at March 31, 2018. 

Contractual Obligations 

For a presentation regarding material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the Company's contractual obligations please refer to Notes 3, 4 and 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

 We do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

For information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 1 of the condensed notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2017 Form 10-K.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity GAAP, as promulgated in the United States, requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. We believe the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The following accounting policies involve the use of “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. In addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period, and changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period both of which may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information about these policies, see Note 1 of the Condensed Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are limited based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.

Revenue Recognition

The Company derives its revenues primarily from subscription and transaction fees pertaining to services delivered over our exchanges or from our application service provider ("ASP") platforms, fees for risk compliance solution services, and fees for software development projects including associated fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems and applications. Sales and value-added taxes are not included in revenues, but rather are recorded as a liability until the taxes assessed are remitted to the respective taxing authorities. 

Under Topic 606, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.


• identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

• identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

• determination of the transaction price;

• allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

• recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.

For contracts that contain multiple deliverables, we analyze the revenue arrangements in accordance with the relevant technical accounting guidance, which provides criteria governing how to determine whether goods or services that are delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be considered as separate performance obligations for the purpose of revenue recognition. These types of arrangements include obligations pertaining to software licenses, system set-up, and professional services associated with product customization or modification. Delivery of the various contractual obligations typically occurs over periods of less than eighteen months. These arrangements generally do not have refund provisions or have very limited refund terms. 

Software development arrangements involving significant customization, modification or production are accounted for in accordance with the appropriate technical accounting guidance issued by FASB using the percentage-of-completion method. The Company recognizes revenue using periodic reported actual hours worked as a percentage of total expected hours required to complete the project arrangement and applies the percentage to the total arrangement fee.

Financial exchange revenue consists largely of transaction-based fees and fees from corporate and retail gift vouchers. The transaction-based fees are primarily based on a percentage of payment value processed for solutions such as retail and corporate payments, domestic money transfers, and general purpose reloadable cards. Transaction-based fees are recognized at the completion of the transaction. Gift voucher revenue is recognized at full purchase value at time of sale with the corresponding cost of vouchers recorded under direct expenses.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable

Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts, write-offs, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.

Valuation of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent the fair value of acquired contractual customer relationships for which future cash flows are expected to continue indefinitely. In accordance with the relevant FASB accounting guidance, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would likely have reduced the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Potential impairment indicators include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, and the sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. The impairment evaluation process first involves an assessment of certain qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we were to determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we would not perform the two-step quantitative impairment testing described further below.

 The aforementioned two-step quantitative testing process involves comparing the reporting unit carrying values to their respective fair values. We determine the fair value of our reporting units by applying the discounted cash flow method using the present value of future estimated net cash flows. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then no further testing is required. However, if a reporting unit's fair value were to be less than its carrying value, we would then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any, which would be the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeded its implied value. Projections of cash flows are based on our views of growth rates, operating costs, anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. The use of different estimates or assumptions for our projected discounted cash flows (e.g., growth rates, future economic conditions, discount rates and estimates of terminal values) when determining the fair value of our reporting units could result in different values and may result in a goodwill impairment charge. We perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and testing as of September 30th of each year. This evaluation is done during the fourth quarter each year. During the year ended December 31, 2017 we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances.

Valuation of Contingent Liabilities related to Earn-Out Obligations from Business Acquisitions


Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the estimated future tax effects of differences between financial statement and tax basis of assets, liabilities, operating losses, and tax credit carry forwards using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Valuation allowances, if any, are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management considers more likely than not to be realized. Such valuation allowances are recorded for the portion of the deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized based on the levels of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences will be deductible.

The Company also applies FASB accounting guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes positions. This guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.

Foreign Currency Matters

The functional currency for the Company's foreign subsidiaries in India, Dubai, and Singapore is the U.S. dollar because the intellectual property research and development activities provided by its Dubai and Singapore subsidiary, and the product development and information technology enabled services activities for the insurance industry provided by its India subsidiary, both in support of Ebix's operating divisions across the world, are transacted in U.S. dollars.

The functional currency of the Company's other foreign subsidiaries is the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates. The assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet dates. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses resulting from translation adjustments are included as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses that are derived from transactions denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary's functional currency are included in the determination of net income.

Item 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign-based operations where certain transactions are denominated in other than our entity's functional currency and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies. A majority of the Company’s operations are based in the U.S and India, furthermore the functional currencies in our main India and Singapore offices is the U.S. dollar, and accordingly, a substantial portion of our business transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, the Company has operations in Australia, India (specifically EbixCash), New Zealand, Great Britain, Canada, Brazil, Dubai, Singapore, Philippines, Indonesia, and United Arab Emirates where we conduct transactions in the local currencies of each of these locations.There can be no assurance that fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results, revenues or financial condition. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 the net change in the cumulative foreign currency translation account, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity, were unrealized gains (losses) of $4.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The Company considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in our respective foreign currency exchange rates of 20% could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change in currency exchange rates would have resulted in reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $3.1 million and $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The Company's exposure to interest rate risk relates to its interest expense on outstanding debt obligations and to its interest income on existing cash balances. As of March 31, 2018 the Company had $425.5 million of outstanding debt obligations which consisted of a $250.0 million term loan, a $173.7 million balance on our commercial banking revolving line of credit, and a $1.8 million note due to IHC by the EbixHealth JV. The Company's revolving line of credit bears interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 2.25%, and stood at 3.88% at March 31, 2018. The Company is exposed to market risk in relation to this line of credit in regards to the potential increase in interest expense arising from adverse changes in interest rates. This interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 30 basis point increase in the LIBOR rate. Such an adverse change in the LIBOR rate would have resulted in a reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $611 thousand and $179 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's average cash balances and short term investments during the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $109.9 million and its existing cash balances as of March 31, 2018 were $111.9 million. The Company is exposed to market risk in relation to these cash balances in regards to the potential loss of interest income arising from adverse changes in interest rates. This interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical 20 basis point interest rates earned on deposited funds. Such an adverse change in these interest rates would have resulted in a reduction to pre-tax income of approximately $139 thousand and $155 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

There were no other material changes to our market risk exposure during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. For additional information regarding our exposure to certain market risks, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” in Part II, Item 7A of our 2017 Form 10-K.

Item 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls also are designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Disclosure controls include components of internal control over financial reporting, which consists of control processes designated to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

We monitor and evaluate on an ongoing basis our disclosure controls and procedures in order to improve their overall effectiveness. In the course of these evaluations, we modify and refine our internal processes and controls as conditions warrant.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2018. Based on this evaluation the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as a result of not having completed the remediation of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting identified and described in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2018.

•The strengthening of controls for income taxes in 2018 with the use of additional resources and expanded use of independent third party resources and outside legal tax counsel

•Reviewing and revising internal procedures surrounding valuation accounting, including the use of independent third party resources, internal review and documentation processes. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Item 5: OTHER INFORMATION

On February 21, 2018, Ebix, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Sixth Amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The Sixth Amendment amends the Regions Credit Facility by increasing its existing credit facility from $450 million to$650 million, to assist in funding its growth. The increase in the bank line was the result of many members of the existing bank group expanding their share of the credit facility and the addition of BBVA Compass and Bank Of The West to the Banking Syndicate, which further diversifies Ebix’s lending group under the credit facility to ten participants.The syndicated bank group now comprises ten leading financial institutions that include Regions Bank, PNC Bank, BMO Harris Bank, BBVA Compass, Fifth Third Bank, KeyBank, Bank Of The West, Silicon Valley Bank, Cadence Bank and Trustmark National Bank. Regions Bank continued to lead the banking group while serving as the administrative and collateral agent. PNC Bank and BMO Harris Bank were added as co syndication agents, BBVA Compass and Fifth Third Bank as co documentation agent, while Regions Capital Markets, PNC Capital Markets and BMO Harris Bank acted as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners. The new credit facility has the following key components; A five-year term loan for $250 million, with initial repayments starting June 30, 2018 due in the amount $3.13 million for the first eight quarters and increasing thereafter and a five-year revolving credit facility for $400 

million. The new credit facility, also, allows for up to $150 million of incremental facilities. The Regions Secured Credit Facility carries a leverage-based LIBOR related interest rate, which currently stands at approximately 3.88%. 

On November 3, 2017 the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Fifth Amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Regions Secured Credit Facility, dated August 5, 2014, among the Company, Regions Bank as Administrative and Collateral Agent ("Regions") and certain other lenders party thereto (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") to exercise $50 million of its aggregate $100 million accordion option, increasing the total Term Loan Commitment to$175 million. $20 million of the increase was funded on November 3, 2017 and the remaining $30 million shall be disbursed upon the satisfaction of certain closing requirements set forth in the Fifth Amendment. Both such disbursements are tied to permitted acquisitions as set forth in the Fifth Amendment.

On November 3, 2017, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Fourth Amendment and Waiver (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment waives certain technical defaults related to the failure to give required notice with respect to i) the existence of a subsidiary having intellectual property with an aggregate value above a stipulated amount and ii) the additional investment in a joint venture entity resulting in that entity becoming a subsidiary of the Company for the purpose of the Credit Agreement. In addition to such waiver, the Fourth Amendment also loosened the leverage ratios the Company is required to satisfy in connection with permitted acquisitions and for compliance generally.
