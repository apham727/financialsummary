2. Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of September 30, 2018 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) for interim financial reporting and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, such financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. GAAP requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year or for any future periods. In managements opinion, these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements contain all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements for the interim periods presented. We have elected to early adopt the provisions in Regulation S-X, Rule 8-03(a)(5) and 10-01(a)(7) requiring an analysis of changes in stockholders equity be presented quarterly, in either a statement or on in the notes to the financial statements, for the current and comparative year to date interim periods and state the amount of dividends per share in the aggregate for each class of shares. We have elected to present the requirements in statement form.  

These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, as reported in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Companys significant accounting policies and practices are as described in the Annual Report, except for the adoption of the accounting standards described in Note 3 below.  

Statement of Operations  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, we have changed our presentation of revenue to disclose service revenue and cost of service revenue separately from license revenue and cost of license revenue, as service revenue now exceeds the materiality threshold for an individual line item. Prior year amounts were historically reported on a combined basis and have been restated to conform to current presentation.  

We classify cloud-based subscriptions and other services, such as font related services, custom font design and post contract support as service revenue on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. All other revenue is classified as license revenue.  


Table of Contents 

Highly Inflationary Economy  

At September 30, 2018, our wholly-owned Olapic Argentina S.A. subsidiary employs approximately 99 people whose functions mainly include development, sales support and administration. The monthly operations average between $0.4 million and $0.5 million. The Argentinian economy was recently determined to be highly inflationary. A highly inflationary economy is one where the cumulative inflation rate for the three years preceding the beginning of the reporting period, including interim reporting periods, is in excess of 100 percent. Argentinas inflation rate reached this threshold with the quarterly period ended June 30, 2018. For interim periods ended prior to July 1, 2018, the functional currency for our subsidiary is the Argentinian peso, the foreign entitys local currency.  

For a highly inflationary economy, we followed the guidance in ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters, (Subtopic ASC 830-10-45) and accounted for the change in functional currency from the Argentinian peso to the U.S. dollar effective July 1, 2018. Under this guidance, translation adjustments are not removed from equity, and the translated amounts for nonmonetary assets and liabilities at the end of the prior period become the accounting basis for those assets both in the period of the change and in subsequent periods. A change in functional currency due to an economys designation as highly inflationary results from changes in economic factors (i.e., inflation); therefore, such a change is not considered a change in accounting policy or accounting principle. The change in functional currency did not have a material impact on financial position, operating results or cash flow.  

3. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

Adopted  

Revenue Recognition  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606), which outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on a principle that replaces virtually all existing revenue recognition rules under U.S. GAAP and which requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also provided the guidance in ASC Topic 340, Other Assets and Deferred CostsContracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40), which includes criteria for the capitalization and amortization of certain contract acquisition and fulfillment costs. The standard requires retrospective application; however, it allows entities to choose either full retrospective adoption, in which the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective adoption, in which the cumulative catch-up adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings is recognized at the date of application, with additional disclosures required to describe these effects.  

We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, and applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and have elected to apply the new standard only to contracts not completed at January 1, 2018, which represents contracts for which all (or substantially all) of the revenues have not been recognized under existing guidance as of the date of adoption.  


Table of Contents 




Contract assets, short term are included in the accounts receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.  


Capitalized contract costs, short term are included in the prepaid expenses and other current assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.  


Capitalized contract costs, long term are included in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.  


Deferred revenue, long term is included in other long-term liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.  

In addition, we recognized additional royalty expenses totaling approximately $2.2 million, or $0.05 per share, upon the adoption of ASC 606, as an indirect effect of a change in accounting principle. These amounts are included in cost of revenue  license in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.  






       

Under legacy GAAP, revenue related to our term licenses that were bundled with service-related performance obligations when vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) did not exist was required to be recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Under ASC 606, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation in the contract and each performance obligation is accounted for separately; the license revenue is recognized at the time of delivery and the service revenue is recognized over time based on their relative standalone selling prices. The application of this provision is particularly impactful to our new Mosaic product offering which was launched in the first quarter of 2018. This new offering bundles our traditional font licenses with a SaaS based portal, which under legacy GAAP would have been recognized ratably. This provision also has resulted in some revenue from contracts signed prior to 2018 being accelerated and recorded to retained earnings instead of in our operating results in 2018 and beyond.  

       

We have a limited number of contracts in which we offered extended payment terms for term licenses to our customers, including cases in which the license is delivered in full at the beginning of the contract. Under legacy GAAP, revenue was recognized when the payments became due, based upon the requirement that the fee be fixed or determinable. However, under the new guidance, revenue related to such arrangements is accelerated, with revenue related to the license recognized at the time of delivery, less a financing component (interest income) to be recognized over time based on the payment terms. The application of this provision has resulted in revenue from certain contracts signed prior to 2018 being accelerated and recorded to retained earnings instead of in our operating results in 2018 and beyond. This also impacts new contracts that we sign in 2018.  

       

Under legacy GAAP, we recognized royalty revenue when the licensee reported it to us, typically one quarter after royalty-bearing units were shipped, at which time the fee is fixed or determinable. Under ASC 606, we now estimate royalty revenue from our royalty-based licenses in the period that the royalty-bearing event occurs. Thus, revenue from royalties reported to us in the first quarter of 2018 were recorded to retained earnings upon adoption of ASC 606, rather than being recognized as revenue as it would have been under legacy GAAP. This was partially offset by the recognition of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 for estimated royalties that were reported to us in the second quarter of 2018.  

       

ASC 606 requires certain incremental costs related to contract acquisition, such as sales commissions, and contract fulfillment costs to be capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit whereas the Company had previously recognized such expenses as incurred.  

Please see Note 4 for the Companys policies related to revenue recognition and accounting for costs to obtain and fulfill a customer contract.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)-Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This guidance revises the presentation of the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. The new standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We adopted ASU 2017-07 on January 1, 2018 and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Leases  


The Company will adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019 and has begun planning for adoption by implementing new lease accounting software, and by working to establish additional changes to our processes and internal controls to ensure all requirements are met upon adoption. The standard allows for a modified retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach with comparatives under 840 option, where entities would recognize a cumulative effect to retained earnings at the date of adoption without restating prior periods balances or disclosures. The Company plans to use the modified retrospective approach with comparatives under 840 option that will not require revising comparative period information or disclosure. We will elect the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carryforward the historical lease classification. In addition, we are electing the hindsight practical expedient to determine the lease term for existing leases. We will also elect the practical expedient that allows an accounting policy election to exclude right of use assets and lease obligations from the balance sheet for all leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.  

Management is continuing to assess the impact of this standard on the Companys condensed consolidated balance sheet, condensed consolidated statement of operations, condensed consolidated statements of cash flows or disclosures in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  


We recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of a promised good or service. The amount of revenue recognized reflects consideration that we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services, and excludes any sales incentives and taxes collected from customers that are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  

We adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. The reported results for 2018 reflect the application of ASC 606 guidance while the reported results for 2017 were prepared under legacy GAAP. The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the delivery of our products and services and will provide financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures.  


Creative Professional Revenue  

Our Creative Professional revenue is primarily derived from rights to use font licenses, custom font design services and hosted software as a service, or SaaS, offerings. We license fonts directly to end-users through our direct sales organization, e-commerce websites and indirectly through third-party resellers. Web font and digital ad related services refer to our web font services and web design tools. Our customers include graphic designers, advertising agencies, media organizations and corporations.  

Revenue from font licenses is recognized upfront when the font software is delivered or made available to the customer. Custom font design services are generally not a separate distinct performance obligation and are sold with a license for the custom font, in which case revenue is recognized upon completion of the services and when the font is delivered and  


Table of Contents 

 accepted by the customer. In limited cases, the Company has an enforceable right to payment prior to final delivery and acceptance of custom font design work. In these cases, the Company has determined that the proper treatment is a single over-time performance obligation using input methods (incurred hours towards completion) to measure progress towards completion to determine the pattern of satisfaction of the performance obligation.  

For our hosted offerings where we provide our customers the right to access our software without taking possession, revenue is recognized over the contract period on a time-elapsed basis, which is consistent with the transfer of service to the customer. Payment terms and conditions for Creative Professional contracts generally require payment within thirty to sixty days of contract inception. An exception exists for certain contracts for our SaaS offerings or a limited number of multi-year term license agreements which have periodic payment terms, generally quarterly or annually, over the term of the contract. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the respective payment terms, we have considered whether such contracts include a significant financing component, subject to the applicable practical expedient. The purpose of these payment structures is to align with industry and market standards, not to provide customers with financing. We have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component; however, the Company will continue to assess (1) the length of time between when the goods or services are delivered and expected payment, and (2) prevailing interest rates in the market to re-evaluate this conclusion.  

OEM Revenue  

Our OEM revenue is derived substantially from printer imaging, printer driver and display imaging products. OEM revenue primarily relates to licenses providing our customers the right to embed our fonts and technology in their products over a certain term. Under our OEM licensing arrangements, we either receive a fixed fee as specified under the license arrangement or a royalty for each product unit incorporating our fonts and technology that is shipped by our OEM customers. Although significantly less than royalties from per-unit shipments and fixed fees from OEM customers, we also receive revenue from software application and operating systems vendors, who include our fonts and technology in their products and for font development. Revenue from per-unit royalty contracts is estimated and recognized in the period that the royalty-bearing event or sale by our OEM customer occurs. Revenue from fixed fee licenses is generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software embodying the font is shipped or made available to the customer. Certain OEM contracts may include customer support services and unspecified updates for our font technology that is a distinct stand-ready performance obligation and recognized ratably over the service period. Many of our per-unit royalty licenses continue for the duration that our OEM customers ship products that include our technology, unless terminated for breach. Other licenses have terms that typically range from one fiscal quarter to five years, and usually provide for automatic or optional renewals.  

Disaggregated Revenue  



Significant Judgments  

Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Once we determine the performance obligations, the Company determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. We then allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative stand-alone selling price method. The corresponding revenue is recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied as discussed in the revenue categories above.  


Table of Contents 

Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. We determine standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.  


As discussed above, certain of our Creative Professional contracts have payment terms that differ from the timing of revenue recognition which requires us to assess whether the transaction price for those contracts include a significant financing component. We have elected the practical expedient that permits an entity to not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect that at the contract inception, the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. For those contracts in which the period exceeds the one year threshold, this assessment, as well as the quantitative estimate of the financing component and its relative significance, requires judgment. We estimate the significant financing component provided to our customers with extended payment terms by determining the present value of the future payments by applying a discount rate that reflects the customers creditworthiness.  

Transaction Price Allocated to Future Performance Obligations  



Contract Balances  

Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record an unbilled receivable, or contract asset, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing when we have an enforceable right to payment. When invoicing occurs prior to revenue recognition, we have unearned revenue, or contract liabilities, presented on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue within deferred revenue and other long-term liabilities, as appropriate. When invoicing occurs after revenue recognition, we have earned revenue, or contract assets, presented on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as unbilled receivables within accounts receivable and other assets, as appropriate.  

Revenue recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 from amounts included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period were approximately $7.2 million and $21.6 million, respectively. Revenue recognized during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 from performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods, mainly due to changes in the estimate of royalty revenues, was $7.9 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the change in contract assets reclassified to receivables as a result of the right to the transaction consideration becoming unconditional was not material. The contract modifications entered into during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 did not have a significant impact on the Companys contract assets or deferred revenue.  


Table of Contents 

Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract  

We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain commissions paid under our sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. The amount capitalized for incremental costs to obtain contracts as of September 30, 2018 was $2.5 million, of which $0.6 million was short-term and has been included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $1.9 million was long term and has been included in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Costs to obtain a contract are amortized as sales and marketing expense over the expected period of benefit in a manner that is consistent with the transfer of the related goods or services to which the asset relates. The judgments made in determining the amount of costs incurred include whether the commissions are in fact incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract and the estimate of the amortization period, which ranges between three and ten years depending on the nature of the performance obligations within the contract. These costs are periodically reviewed for impairment. The amount of capitalized costs related to contracts which were terminated on or before September 30, 2018, due to the customer exercising an opt-out clause or the cancellation of an anticipated renewal was not material and was charged to operating expenses in the third quarter of 2018.  

We have elected to apply the practical expedient and recognize the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.  

We capitalize incremental costs incurred to fulfill our contracts that (i) relate directly to the contract, (ii) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy the Companys performance obligation under the contract, and (iii) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Contract fulfillment costs primarily relate to font license fees that we pay on certain fonts that are owned by third parties. These fees are related to license revenue that is satisfied at a point in time and payable again upon license renewal, and as a result are incurred immediately upon contract execution. Accordingly, there are no capitalized costs related to costs to fulfill a contract as of September 30, 2018.  

5. Fair Value Measurements  





The Companys recurring fair value measures relate to short-term investments, which are classified as cash equivalents, derivative instruments and from time to time contingent consideration. The fair value of our cash equivalents is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets. The fair value of our derivatives is based on quoted market prices from various banking institutions or an independent third-party provider for similar instruments. In determining the fair value, we consider our non-performance risk and that of our counterparties. At September 30, 2018, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.6 million British pounds sterling and purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value; and at December 31, 2017, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.5 million British pounds sterling and purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value.  

The Companys non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities subject to non-recurring measurements include goodwill and intangible assets.  

6. Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, the Company decided to cease sales of certain service offerings that were principally acquired as part of the Companys acquisition of Swyft Media in January 2015. The decision was made in connection with other restructuring actions to re-align the Companys product and service offerings. See Note 13 for further details regarding the restructuring plan.  

The Company has determined that disposal of the Swyft Media component did not qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation under ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations, as it did not represent a strategic shift in the Companys operations that had (or will have) a major effect on the Companys consolidated operations or financial results. As a result of its decision to cease sales of certain service offerings, the Company concluded that the useful life of certain long-lived assets, which represented the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Swyft Media, was zero and that there was no ongoing expected future cash flows related to these long-lived assets and no residual value. As a result, such assets were determined to be fully impaired and an impairment charge of approximately $2.6 million, representing the carrying value of these intangible assets, was recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2018.

Goodwill  



Intangible Assets  




On September 15, 2015, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement) by and among the Company, the Companys subsidiary, Monotype Imaging Inc., any financial institution that becomes a Lender (as defined therein) and Silicon Valley Bank, as agent which provides for a five-year $150.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility permits the Company to request that the Lenders, at their election, increase the secured credit facility to a maximum of $200.0 million. The Credit Facility is available to the Company on a revolving basis through September 15, 2020. Repayment of any amounts borrowed are not required until maturity of the Credit Facility. However, the Company may repay any amounts borrowed at any time, without premium or penalty. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had $80.0 million and $93.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, available borrowings under the Credit Facility have been reduced by approximately $0.5 million for one standby letter of credit issued in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $69.5 million and $56.5 million available for borrowing at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear a variable rate not less than zero based upon, at the Companys option, either LIBOR or the higher of (i) the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, and (ii) 0.5% plus the overnight federal funds rate, plus in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for LIBOR loans, based on the applicable leverage ratio, is 1.25%, 1.50% or 1.75% per annum, and the applicable margin for base rate loans, based on the applicable leverage ratio, is either 0.25%, 0.50% or 0.75% per annum. At September 30, 2018, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.8% for LIBOR, and at December 31, 2017, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.1% for LIBOR.

8. Defined Benefit Pension Plan  

Our German subsidiary maintains an unfunded defined benefit pension plan which covers substantially all employees who joined the company prior to the plans closure to new participants in 2006. Participants are entitled to benefits in the form of retirement, disability and surviving dependent pensions. Benefits generally depend on years of service and the salary of the employees.  






At September 30, 2018, the reserve for uncertain tax positions was approximately $7.0 million. Of this amount, $4.7 million is recorded as a reduction of deferred tax assets and $2.3 million is classified as long-term liabilities. During the quarter, the Company recorded a benefit of $0.4 million related to reserves no longer required due to the lapses of statutes of limitations.  


Table of Contents 

As disclosed in the Companys 2017 Form 10-K, the Company recorded the tax effects of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (The Act) in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The new legislation required the Company to pay tax on the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries through December 31, 2017. The Company recorded an initial estimate of the tax on unremitted earnings of approximately $0.2 million; however, this amount was offset by available foreign tax credits, and as a result the net estimated amount payable related to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was zero. The Company finalized this estimate during the quarter, and there was no change from the initial estimate.  

10. Net Income (Loss) Per Share  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the net income (loss) available to common shareholders is divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period to calculate diluted earnings per share. The assumed exercise of stock options and assumed vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units were included in the computation of net income per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and for the three months ended September 30, 2017, but were excluded in the computation of net (loss) per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and for the three months ended September 30, 2017, the two-class method was used in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share, as the result was more dilutive.

Stock Based Compensation  



In the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, $3 thousand and $44 thousand, respectively, of stock based compensation was capitalized as part of internal software projects, and this amount is included in property and equipment, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, $24 thousand and $97 thousand, respectively, of stock based compensation was capitalized as part of internal software projects, and this amount is included in property and equipment, net in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, $1.4 million of stock based compensation expense was reversed as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan. This non-recurring amount has been included in restructuring expenses.  

As of September 30, 2018, the Company had $29.0 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to employees and directors unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock option awards that are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years.  




Geographic segment information  

We market our products and services principally through offices in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, China, Republic of Korea and Japan. We report revenue based on the geographic location of our customers. For example, licenses may be sold to large international companies, which may be headquartered in the Republic of Korea, such revenues would be included in the revenue defined as Rest of World.  


Table of Contents 






On June 6, 2018, the Company implemented a restructuring plan, under which the Company will reduce headcount in certain areas of the Company, made the decision to cease sales and marketing of the Swyft product and service line and to close a regional office, all in an effort to improve operational efficiencies. The plan provided for the elimination of approximately 50 positions worldwide across a variety of functions, with a concentration within engineering, as well as sales and marketing. The Company recorded net charges totaling $0.2 million and $6.8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, related to severance and termination benefits, net of stock based compensation reversal, the write off of goodwill and intangible assets attributable to Swyft, the acceleration of the final deferred compensation payment to the founders of Swyft, and charges associated with the office closure.

We reversed $1.4 million of stock based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan. See Note 6 for further details regarding the intangible asset disposal and write off of goodwill.  



Future cash expenditures related to the restructuring are expected to be approximately $2.3 million, net of tax savings. We expect the restructuring plan to be completed by the end of 2018, other than the payment of deferred termination benefits to certain terminated employees.  

14. Commitments and Contingencies  

Legal Proceedings  

From time to time, we may be a party to various claims, suits and complaints. We do not believe that there are claims or legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  

Licensing Warranty  

Under our standard license agreement with our OEM customers, we warrant that the licensed technologies are free of infringement claims of intellectual property rights and will meet the specifications as defined in the licensing agreement for a specified period, typically one year. Under the licensing agreements, liability for such indemnity obligations is limited, generally to the total arrangement fee; however, exceptions have been made on a case-by-case basis, increasing the maximum potential liability to agreed upon amounts at the time the contract is entered into or unlimited liability. We have never incurred costs payable to a customer or business partner to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these warranties, and as a result, management believes the estimated fair value of these warranties is minimal. Accordingly, there are no liabilities recorded for these warranties as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

Stock Purchase Program  

Subsequent to September 30, 2018, the Company purchased 315,000 shares of common stock for $6.3 million, at an average price per share of $19.80 through October 26, 2018. The Company purchased these shares on the open market at prevailing market prices and in accordance with its previously announced share purchase program. At October 26, 2018, $12.0 million remains for future purchase under the Plan.  

Dividend Declaration  

On October 25, 2018, the Companys Board of Directors declared a $0.116 per share quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The record date is set for January 2, 2019 and the dividend is payable to shareholders of record on January 22, 2019. Dividends are declared at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and depend on actual cash from operations, the Companys financial condition and capital requirements and any other factors the Companys Board of Directors may consider relevant. Future dividend declarations, as well as the record and payment dates for such dividends, will be determined by the Companys Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.

Sources of Revenue  


Some of our revenue streams, particularly project-related and custom font design service revenue where spending is largely discretionary in nature, have historically been, and we expect them to continue to be in the future, susceptible to weakening economic conditions.  



For the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 54.5% and 53.8%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 55.3% and 56.3%, respectively, of our total revenue. We expect that sales by our international subsidiaries will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our products worldwide.  

We derive a significant portion of our OEM revenue from a limited number of customers, in particular manufacturers of laser printers and consumer electronic devices. For the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 26.9% and 27.5% of our total revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately 23.6% and 28.4% of our total revenue, respectively. Although no one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the three months or nine months ended September 30, 2018 or 2017, if we are unable to maintain relationships with major customers or establish relationships with new customers, our licensing revenue will be adversely affected.

Creative Professional Revenue  

For a description of our Creative Professional revenue and related accounting policy, see Note 4.  

OEM Revenue  

For a description of our OEM revenue and related accounting policy, see Note 4.  

Cost of Revenue  

Our cost of revenue consists of font license fees that we pay on certain fonts that are owned by third parties, personnel and allocated internal engineering expense and overhead costs related to custom font design services and SaaS based offerings and cloud-based web service costs. License fees that we pay to third parties are typically based on a percentage of our Creative Professional and OEM revenue and do not involve minimum fees.  

Cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquired technology, which we amortize over 7 to 15 years. For purposes of amortizing acquired technology, we estimate the remaining useful life of the technology based upon various considerations, including our knowledge of the technology and the way our customers use it. We use the straight-line method to amortize acquired technology. There is no reliable evidence to suggest that we should expect any other pattern of amortization than an even pattern, and we believe this best reflects the expected pattern of economic usage.  

Gross Profit  

Our gross profit percentage is influenced by a number of factors including product mix, pricing and volume at any particular time. However, cost of OEM revenue is typically lower than cost of Creative Professional revenue because we own a higher percentage of the fonts licensed to OEM customers, provide value-added technology and have negotiated lower royalty rates on the fonts we license from third parties because of volume. In addition, within our Creative Professional business, the cost of custom font design and SaaS based service revenue is substantially higher than the cost of other revenue. The relative cost of Creative Professional revenue has decreased in recent periods, as efforts to sell license rights to more fonts that we own have been successful, and because we have recently experienced success in our effort to sell certain license rights that carry lower royalty rates to Creative Professional customers. Creative Professional revenue is growing at a faster rate than OEM revenue. We expect these trends to continue. Our gross profit is subject to variability from period-to-period, depending on the product mix and the level of custom font design and SaaS based service revenue.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

Information about our critical accounting policies may be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading Critical Accounting Policies, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, except for the adoption as of January 1, 2018, of guidance in ASC 606 as more fully described in Note 3 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated quarterly statements.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2017  



License revenue decreased primarily due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the third quarter of 2017, as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts. There was no corresponding item in the current period. In addition, our royalty based revenue is lower in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We now estimate and accrue royalty-based revenue in the quarter when the royalty-based units are shipped, as opposed to when those shipments were reported to us by the licensee under legacy GAAP.  

Service revenue has increased primarily due to the growth of our SaaS-based product offerings, including our Mosaic solution.  

Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased to 84.8% from 86.4%, period over period. Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, increased to 79.8% and 72.3%. See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.  

While revenue from services has grown to a level of significance requiring separate disclosure, we continue to operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.

The following discussion compares the three months ended September 30, 2018 with the three months ended September 30, 2017.  

Revenues by Market.  





Table of Contents 

Revenue  

Revenue was $58.0 million and $60.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $2.5 million, or 4.2%.  

Creative Professional revenue was $36.1 million and $34.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $1.6 million, or 4.6%, mainly due to growth in sales to enterprise customers and increased service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our portfolio.  

OEM revenue decreased $4.1 million, or 16.0%, to $21.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $26.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2017. Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to lower revenue from customers under fixed fee contracts and partially due to $2.0 million of one-time payments recognized in the third quarter of 2017 from the conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts. There was no corresponding item in the current period. Display imaging revenue decreased mainly due to a few large deals in the third quarter of 2017 that did not repeat in the third quarter of 2018.  

Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit  

Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was $9.4 million and $9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 3.3%, mainly due to lower total revenue.  

The portion of cost of revenue consisting of amortization of acquired technology was unchanged at $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  

Gross profit was 82.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to 82.5% in the three months ended September 30, 2017, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points.  

Operating Expenses  

Marketing and Selling. Marketing and selling expense decreased $4.3 million, or 18.9%, to $18.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $22.5 million in the same period in 2017. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $3.2 million, period over period, due to lower headcount mainly from our restructuring actions in the second quarter of 2018. Targeted marketing spending and consulting together decreased $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, due to portfolio decisions around discretionary programs. Decreased facilities expense, mainly due to the consolidation of certain regional offices in 2017, was offset by increased software expenses, mainly due to investments in information systems supporting the Creative Professional business, period over period.  

Research and Development. Research and development expense was $7.7 million and $9.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 14.6%, primarily due to lower personnel expenses. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $1.2 million, period over period, due to lower headcount mainly from restructuring actions in the second quarter of 2018 and in the fourth quarter of 2017.  

General and Administrative. General and administrative expense was $10.8 million and $11.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 4.5%. Audit and legal expenses together decreased $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, mainly due to lower audit fees in the third quarter of 2018 and additional expenses incurred related to shareholder activities in the prior period, which did not recur.  

Restructuring. Restructuring expense was $0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 due to additional severance expense and charges associated with the closure of one of our regional offices. There were no similar charges in the same period in 2017.  

Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets was $0.9 million and $1.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 16.8%.  


Table of Contents 

Interest Expense, Net  

Interest expense, net of interest income was $0.8 million and $0.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.1 million, or 18.2%, mainly due to increases in interest rates on our outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a reduction in the balance outstanding.  

Loss on Foreign Exchange  

Losses on foreign exchange were $0.4 million and $1.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $1.0 million, primarily the result of currency fluctuations on our foreign denominated receivables and payables. In the three months ended September 30, 2017, the loss was primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, as compared to the U.S. dollar, on U.S. dollar denominated receivables held by our foreign subsidiaries.  

Loss (Gain) on Derivatives  

Loss (gain) on derivatives was a gain of $47 thousand and a loss of $0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, due to our 30-day forward currency contracts.  

Provision for Income Taxes  


       

The statutory tax rate in the three months ended September 30, 2018 is 21.0%, as compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0% in the same period in 2017.  

       

Foreign rate differential increased our effective rate 30.4% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to a decrease of 2.7% in the same period in 2017, due to changes in tax treatment of foreign earnings under The Act. These changes include significant new limitations on the ability to utilize foreign tax credits, and the effects of the new Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions. These provisions have resulted in a significantly higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings.  

       

Non-deductible expenses added 14.9% to the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to 40.7% in the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased income before taxes.  

In addition, the effective rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was reduced by 4.2% for a reduction in reserves resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitations. State and local taxes, net of federal benefit, provided a benefit of 4.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to 0.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2018, mainly due to adjustments to our deferred state tax balances, which resulted from changes in our estimated state tax rate.  

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017  



License revenue decreased primarily due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts, partially offset by growth in sales to our enterprise customers. There was no corresponding item in the current period. In addition, our royalty based revenue is lower in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We now estimate and accrue our royalty-based revenue in the quarter when the royalty-based units are shipped, as opposed to when those shipments were reported to us by the licensee under legacy GAAP. This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017.  


Table of Contents 

Service revenue has increased primarily due to the growth of our SaaS-based product offerings, including our Mosaic solution.  

Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased to 82.9% from 85.3%, primarily due to additional non-recurring royalty expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 for which there was no corresponding revenue in the corresponding period in 2017, in accordance with ASC 606. Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, increased to 77.6% from 73.4%. See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.  

While revenue from services has grown to a level of significance requiring separate disclosure, we continue to operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.  




Table of Contents 

The following discussion compares the nine months ended September 30, 2018 with the nine months ended September 30, 2017.  

Revenue by Market.  



Revenue  

Revenue was $175.3 million and $170.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $4.5 million, or 2.7%.  

Creative Professional revenue increased $17.3 million, or 18.8%, to $109.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to $92.2 million in the same period in 2017, mainly due to growth in sales of revenue from our enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic solution and higher service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our offering portfolio.  

OEM revenue decreased $12.7 million, or 16.3%, to $65.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $78.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to $6.1 million of one-time payments recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 from the conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts. There was no corresponding item in the current period. Additionally, we recorded lower royalty based revenue as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We now estimate and accrue royalty-based revenue in the quarter when the royalty-based units are shipped, as opposed to when those shipments were reported to us by the licensee under legacy GAAP. This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017.  

Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit  

Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was $31.8 million and $28.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $3.2 million, or 11.0%, mainly due to $2.2 million of additional non-recurring royalty expense for which there was no corresponding revenue item in the period in accordance with ASC 606 and higher costs associated with the revenue from our enterprise customers. As a percentage of sales, cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was 18.1% and 16.8% of total revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  

Amortization of acquired technology was unchanged at $2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  

Gross profit was 80.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to 81.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017, a decrease of 1.3 percentage points partially due to the additional non-recurring royalty expense as described above, and partially due to the continued shift in product mix between Creative Professional and the higher margin OEM business.  

Operating Expenses  

Marketing and Selling. Marketing and selling expense was $58.4 million and $66.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $8.0 million, or 12.1%.

Decreased facilities expense contributed $0.4 million to the overall decrease period over period, due to the consolidation of certain regional offices in 2017. Consulting expense decreased $0.4 million, period over period due to the timing of projects.  

General and Administrative. General and administrative expense was $38.3 million and $34.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $4.3 million, or 12.4%. Outside consulting and legal expenses increased $3.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to additional expenses incurred related to shareholder activities.

Severance expenses totaled $4.4 million and an acceleration of Swyft deferred compensation payment resulted in an incremental charge of $0.5 million mainly due to the restructuring action in the second quarter of 2018. Facilities charges were $0.1 million due to the closure of one of our regional offices in the third quarter of 2018. These charges were partially offset by a $1.4 million reversal of stock based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan. There were no similar charges in the same period in 2017.  

Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets was $2.8 million and $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 7.0%.

Provision for Income Taxes  


       

As a result of the enactment of The Act in December 2017, the statutory tax rate in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 is 21.0%, as compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0% in the same period in 2017.  

       

Foreign rate differential increased our effective rate 31.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to a decrease of 3.6% in the same period in 2017, due to changes in tax treatment of foreign earnings under The Act. These changes include significant new limitations on the ability to utilize foreign tax credits, and the effects of the new Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions. These provisions have resulted in a significantly higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings.  

       

Non-deductible expenses added 15.0% to the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to 55.9% in the same period in 2017, as a result of the increase in income before taxes and changes in deductibility of certain expenses under The Act.  

In addition, a net windfall on stock based compensation resulted in a 1.1% reduction in the effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to a shortfall rate in the same period in 2017 that resulted in a 61.5% increase in the effective rate. Further, state and local taxes reduced the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 by 18.0%, as compared to 0.8% in the current period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 the change in state tax resulted mainly from adjustments to our deferred stat tax balances which resulted from changes in our estimated state tax rate.  

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements may be found in Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 and 2017  

Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, private and public stock sales and long-term debt arrangements, as described below. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, our cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. At September 30, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $70.1 million and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility, of which there was $80.0 million of outstanding borrowings. On May 3, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock, which permits purchases through June 7, 2019. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we used $6.7 million in cash to purchase shares under the plan. At September 30, 2018, the plan has $18.3 million available for future purchases. Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the operations of our existing business, our potential strategic expansion and future acquisitions we might undertake.

Operating Activities  

We generated $11.4 million in cash from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Net income, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, loss on retirement of fixed assets, amortization of deferred financing costs and accretion of interest, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes and unrealized currency gain on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $24.3 million in cash. The non-cash impairment of Swyft related intangible assets added back $3.2 million.  

Accrued expenses and accounts payable used $10.8 million, inclusive of large non-recurring payments of deferred compensation of $10.0 million, additional royalty payments resulting from the adoption of ASC 606 of $2.1 million and payment of investor relations advisor fees of $2.2 million. In addition, we paid 2017 accrued variable compensation, offset by additional restructuring accruals. Decreased accounts receivable, net of decreased deferred revenue generated $1.2 million in cash, primarily a result of customer payments received, net of an increase in unbilled receivables due to the adoption of ASC 606. Prepaid expense and other assets used $4.8 million in cash, mainly due to an increase in long term unbilled receivables and capitalized contract costs related to the adoption of ASC 606. Accrued income taxes used $1.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.  

Variations in operating cash flows occur from time-to-time because our enterprise customers make upfront payments on subscription revenue. These payments are required under the terms of our license agreements and can cause large fluctuations in accounts receivable and deferred revenue. The timing and extent of such payments may significantly impact our cash balances.  

We generated $21.5 million in cash from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Net income, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, loss on retirement of fixed assets, loss on debt extinguishment, amortization of deferred financing costs and accretion of interest, stock based compensation, excess tax benefit on stock options, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes and unrealized currency gain on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $26.1 million in cash. Increased prepaid expenses and other assets combined with decreased accounts payable, offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, used $1.4 million, which is mainly due to the timing of payments. Accrued income taxes used $0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Increased accounts receivable, coupled with decreased deferred revenue used $2.9 million net in cash, which is mainly due to the timing of customer payments.  

Investing Activities  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we used $2.8 million in investing activities mainly for the purchase of property and equipment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we used $5.3 million in investing activities mainly for the purchase of property and equipment.  

Financing Activities  

Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $32.5 million. We received cash from the exercises of stock options of $3.5 million. We paid cash dividends of $14.5 million and paid $13.0 million on our outstanding revolving line of credit. We also purchased $6.7 million in treasury stock and paid $1.8 million in employee taxes on shares withheld in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $29.2 million. We received cash from the exercises of stock options of $1.0 million. We paid cash dividends of $14.0 million and paid $9.0 million on our outstanding revolving line of credit. We also purchased $6.4 million in treasury stock and paid $0.8 million in employee taxes on shares withheld in the nine months ended September 30, 2017.  

Dividends  

On July 25, 2018 our Board of Directors approved a $0.116 per share or $4.9 million, quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The record date was October 1, 2018 and the dividend was paid to shareholders of record on October 19, 2018. We anticipate this to be a recurring quarterly dividend with future payments and record dates, subject to board approval. On October 25, 2018, the Companys Board of Directors approved a $0.116 per share quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The record date is set for January 2, 2019 and the dividend is payable to shareholders of record on January 22, 2019.

Credit Facility  

On September 15, 2015, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement) by and among the Company, the Companys subsidiary, Monotype Imaging Inc., any financial institution that becomes a Lender (as defined therein) and Silicon Valley Bank, as agent which provides for a five-year $150.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility permits the Company to request that the Lenders, at their election, increase the secured credit facility to a maximum of $200.0 million. The Credit Facility is available to the Company on a revolving basis through September 15, 2020. Repayment of any amounts borrowed are not required until maturity of the Credit Facility. However, the Company may repay any amounts borrowed at any time, without premium or penalty. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear a variable rate not less than zero based upon, at the Companys option, either LIBOR or the higher of (i) the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal and (ii) 0.5% plus the overnight federal funds rate, plus in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for LIBOR loans, based on the applicable leverage ratio, is 1.25%, 1.50% or 1.75% per annum, and the applicable margin for base rate loans, based on the applicable leverage ratio, is either 0.25%, 0.50% or 0.75%% per annum. At September 30, 2018, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.8% for LIBOR, and at December 31, 2017, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.1% for LIBOR. The Company had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $80.0 million at September 30, 2018, and $93.0 million at December 31, 2017. The Credit Facility has $0.5 million reserved for one stand-by letter of credit in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $69.5 million and $56.5 million available for borrowing at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  





Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP profitability measures such as income (loss) from operations and net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure has material limitations since it excludes the statement of operations impact of depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, net, the provision (benefit) for income taxes and stock based compensation and therefore does not represent an accurate measure of profitability, particularly in situations where a company is highly leveraged or has a disadvantageous tax structure. We have significant intangible assets and amortization expense is a meaningful element in our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from Adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation. We have a significant amount of debt and we have had a  


Table of Contents 

    significant amount of debt in the past, and interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and therefore its exclusion from Adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation. We generally incur significant U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes each year and the provision for income taxes is a necessary element of our costs and therefore its exclusion from Adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation. Stock based compensation and the associated expense has a meaningful impact on our financial statements. Non-cash expenses, restructuring, issuance and cash non-operating expenses have a meaningful impact on our financial statements. Therefore, their exclusion from Adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income for complete analysis of our profitability, as net income includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable GAAP operating performance measure to Adjusted EBITDA. As Adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of the limitations that Adjusted EBITDA has as an analytical tool, investors should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP.  

The Credit Facility also contains provisions for an increased interest rate during periods of default. We do not believe that these covenants will affect our ability to operate our business, and we were in compliance with the covenants under our Credit Facility as of September 30, 2018.  

Non-GAAP Measures  

In our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls, in addition to Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above, we discuss a key measure that is not calculated according to GAAP. This non-GAAP measure is net adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, other (income) expense, net, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and stock based compensation expenses. We use net adjusted EBITDA as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business. We use net adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our board of directors, determining bonus compensation for our employees based on operating performance and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations. We believe that net adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period-to-period without direct correlation to underlying operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. We believe that trends in our net adjusted EBITDA may be valuable indicators of our operating performance.  

In our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls, in addition to Adjusted EBITDA and net adjusted EBITDA as discussed above, we discuss another key measure that is not calculated according to GAAP. This non-GAAP measure is non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, which is defined as earnings per diluted share before amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock based compensation expenses and acquisition-related compensation. We use non-GAAP earnings per diluted share as one of our principal indicators of the operating performance of our business. We use non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in internal forecasts, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our board of directors and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations. We believe that non-GAAP earnings per diluted share permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period-to-period without direct correlation to underlying operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. We believe that trends in our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share may be valuable indicators of our operating performance.  

In March 2018, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share to exclude the impact of one-time non-recurring expenses, such as certain advisor fees, royalty expenses and restructuring expenses. This change more accurately reflects managements view of the Companys business and financial performance. The three months and nine months ended September 30, 2017 have been restated for comparison purposes.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

We are exposed to financial market risk, including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk.  

Concentration of Revenue and Credit Risk  

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. Cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposits. Deposits of cash held outside the United States totaled approximately $29.5 million and $24.3 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  


Table of Contents 

We grant credit to customers in the ordinary course of business. Credit evaluations are performed on an ongoing basis to reduce credit risk, and no collateral is required from our customers. An allowance for uncollectible accounts is provided for those accounts receivable considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and credit evaluation. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, none of our customers individually accounted for 10% or more of our gross accounts receivable. Due to the nature of our quarterly revenue streams derived from royalty revenue, it is not unusual for our accounts receivable balances to include a few customers with large balances. Historically, we have not recorded material losses due to customers nonpayment. Our Creative Professional business consists of a higher volume of lower dollar value transactions. Accordingly, as the percent of Creative Professional revenue increases in relation to total revenue, we expect the average time to collect our accounts receivables, and our overall accounts receivables balances, to increase.  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.  

Interest Rate Risk  

Our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility of $80.0 million and $93.0 million, respectively. The interest rate on our Credit Facility fluctuates with either the prime rate or the LIBOR interest rate and at September 30, 2018 our rate was 3.8% for LIBOR. A 10% increase in the rate would increase our annual interest expense by $0.2 million.  

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  

In accordance with ASC Topic No. 830, Foreign Currency Matters, or ASC 830, all assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated at the average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments as calculated from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity.  

As discussed in Note 1, our wholly-owned Olapic Argentina S.A. subsidiary employs approximately 99 people whose functions mainly include development, sales support and administration. The Argentinian economy was recently determined to be highly inflationary. Argentinas inflation rate reached this threshold with the quarterly period ended June 30, 2018. In accordance with this designation, we were required to apply the guidance in ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters, (Subtopic ASC 830-10-45-10), and account for a change in functional currency from the Argentinian peso to the U.S. dollar effective July 1, 2018. While we conduct our operation in Argentina Pesos, effective July 1, 2018, the functional currency was changed to the U.S. dollar. The operation is a service center supporting the companys products and generates no revenue. Thus, the expenses primarily consist of compensation and related costs, totaling approximately $0.4 million to $0.5 million per month. The change in functional currency to U.S. dollars did not have a material impact on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.  


We incur foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to certain customers that are invoiced in U.S. dollars, but who have the option to make an equivalent payment in their own functional currencies at a specified exchange rate as of a specified date. In the period from that date until payment in the customers functional currency is received and converted into U.S. dollars, we can incur realized gains and losses. We also incur foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. We are currently utilizing 30-day forward contracts to mitigate our exposure on these currency fluctuations. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged assets of our consolidated foreign affiliate. At September 30, 2018, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.6 million British pounds sterling and to purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value. At December 31, 2017, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.5 million British pounds sterling and to purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2018. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.  

Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2018, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Part IIOTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

From time to time, we may be a party to various claims, suits and complaints. We do not believe that there are claims or legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  

 Item 1A. Risk Factors  

Except as noted below, there are no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

We conduct a substantial portion of our business outside North America and, as a result, we face diverse risks related to engaging in international business.  

We have offices in seven foreign countries and we are dedicating a significant portion of our sales efforts in countries outside North America. We are dependent on international sales for a substantial amount of our total revenue. In 2017 and 2016, approximately 56.9% and 58.3%, respectively, of our total revenue was derived from operations outside the U.S. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, 54.5% and 55.3%, respectively, of our total revenue was derived from operations outside of the U.S. and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. This future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our type and technologies, including the licensing of our solutions worldwide.  


       

our ability to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent that the United States does, which increases the risk of unauthorized and uncompensated use of our type or technologies;  

       

United States and foreign government trade or tariff restrictions, including those that may impose restrictions on importation of programming, technology or components to or from the United States;  


Table of Contents 

       

foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon us in the United States, and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the United States;  

       

risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, in particular fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen, the European Unions euro, and the United Kingdoms pound sterling, including risks related to hedging activities we may undertake;  

       

foreign labor laws, regulations and restrictions;  

       

changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, including the United Kingdoms decision to leave the European Union, as well as related events;  

       

difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;  

       


       

the strength of international economies, including consideration of high inflation rates.
