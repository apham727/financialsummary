  1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

  Principles of Consolidation 

 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Scientific Industries, Inc., Altamira Instruments, Inc. (“Altamira”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary, and Scientific Bioprocessing, Inc. (“SBI”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary, and Scientific Packaging Industries, Inc., an inactive wholly-owned subsidiary (all collectively referred to as the “Company”). All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842). The FASB issued this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard. 


  Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 



 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”. This update provides guidance on how to record eight specific cash flow issues. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and a retrospective transition method to each period should be presented. The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 

 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)”, requiring that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective approach which requires application of the guidance for all periods presented. The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 

  Reclassification 

  Trade accounts receivable, current of $307,200 and $278,200, and trade accounts receivable, long term of $245,400 for the year ended June 30, 2018 were reclassified to contract assets, current; and contract assets, less current portion, respectively, on the balance sheet as of December 31, and June 30, 2018. Customer advances were reclassified to contract liabilities as of December 31, and June 30, 2018. 


 The Company’s revenues are comprised of product sales (Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations) as well as products and related services such as installation and training as is customary for its customers of the Catalyst Research Instruments Operations. In addition, the Company’s Bioprocessing Systems Operations’ revenues are comprised of royalty revenues. All revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligation(s) under the contract (either implicit or explicit) by transferring the promised product or service to its customer either when (or as) its customer obtains control of the product or service. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. The majority of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promise to transfer products or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract and, therefore, not distinct. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using the Company’s best estimate of standalone selling price for each distinct product or service in the contract, which is generally based on an observable price. 

 Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products or providing services. As such, revenue is recorded net of returns, allowances, customer discounts, and incentives. Revenue from the Bioprocessing Systems Operations are recognized over time based on Management’s judgment and estimates. 

  3. Segment Information and Concentrations 






 Approximately 51% and 53% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (42% and 48% of total revenues) for the three month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories. 

 Approximately 25% and 21% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (21% and 19% of total revenues) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

 For the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, three customers accounted for approximately 21% and 22% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (18% and 20% of the Company’s total revenues). Sales of catalyst research instruments generally comprise a few very large orders averaging approximately $50,000 per order to a limited number of customers, who differ from order to order. Sales to two and one customer during the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, accounted for approximately 96% and 74% of the Catalyst Research Instrument Operations’ revenues and 10% and 7% of the Company’s total revenues, respectively. 




 Approximately 50% total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (41% and 46% of total revenues) for both six month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories. 

 Approximately 25% and 23% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (21% of total revenues) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for both the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, three customers accountedy for approximately 22% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations for both six month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (18% and 20% of the Company’s total revenues), respectively. 

 Sales of catalyst research instruments generally comprise a few very large orders averaging approximately $50,000 per order to a limited number of customers, who differ from order to order. Sales to five and one customer during the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, accounted for approximately 90% and 64% of the Catalyst Research Instrument Operations’ revenues and 10% and 4% of the Company’s total revenues, respectively. 

  4. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. 


 Level 1 - Inputs that are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 

 Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 

 Level 3 - Prices or valuation that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

 In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company calculated the fair value of its Level 1 and 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments. These calculations take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and its counterparties. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. 


 The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria. The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the following tables. 











 Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value, and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. The estimate is based on managements review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. Cost of work-in-process and finished goods inventories include material, labor, and manufacturing overhead. 



  6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with the Company’s acquisitions. Goodwill amounted to $705,300 at December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 




 Total amortization expense was $61,300 and $61,100 for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively and $122,300 and $122,200 for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets is $64,700 for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, $66,400 for fiscal 2020, $49,100 for fiscal 2021, $26,100 for fiscal 2022, $9,800 for fiscal 2023, and $6,500 thereafter. 


  7. Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share 



 Approximately 82,000 shares of the Company's common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2017, because the effect would be anti-dilutive. 


 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

  Forward-Looking statements. Certain statements contained in this report are not based on historical facts, but are forward-looking statements that are based upon various assumptions about future conditions. Actual events in the future could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking information. Numerous unknown factors and future events could cause such differences, including but not limited to, product demand, market acceptance, success of marketing strategy, success of expansion efforts, impact of competition, adverse economic conditions, and other factors affecting the Company’s business that are beyond the Company’s control, which are discussed elsewhere in this report. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report.
