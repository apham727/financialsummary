FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and any exhibits to this Report contain “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “expect”, “intend”, “will”, “should” and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect management’s current beliefs, assumptions and expectations and are subject to a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially. Such factors include but are not limited to: our ability to address our business challenges in order to reverse revenue declines, reduce costs and increase productivity so that we can invest in and grow our business; changes in economic and political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements and tax laws in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; our ability to successfully develop new products, technologies and service offerings and to protect our intellectual property rights; the risk that multi-year contracts with governmental entities could be terminated prior to the end of the contract term and that civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could be imposed on us if we fail to comply with the terms of such contracts and applicable law; the risk that partners, subcontractors and software vendors will not perform in a timely, quality manner; actions of competitors and our ability to promptly and effectively react to changing technologies and customer expectations; our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to maintain and improve cost efficiency of operations, including savings from restructuring actions; the risk that individually identifiable information of customers, clients and employees could be inadvertently disclosed or disclosed as a result of a breach of our security systems; reliance on third parties, including subcontractors, for manufacturing of products and provision of services; our ability to manage changes in the printing environment and expand equipment placements; interest rates, cost of borrowing and access to credit markets; funding requirements associated with our employee pension and retiree health benefit plans; the risk that our operations and products may not comply with applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, particularly environmental regulations and directives and anti-corruption laws; the outcome of litigation and regulatory proceedings to which we may be a party; the effects on our business resulting from actions of activist shareholders; and other factors that are set forth in the “Risk Factors” section, the “Legal Proceedings” section, the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Furthermore, the actual results of the proposed transaction with FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation ("Transaction") could vary materially as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to: (i) the risk that the Transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect Xerox’s business and the price of Xerox’s common stock, (ii) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the consummation of the Transaction, including the receipt of certain approvals from Xerox’s shareholders and certain governmental and regulatory approvals, (iii) the parties may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies in the Transaction within the expected time frames or at all, (iv) the Transaction may not result in the accretion to Xerox’s earnings or other benefits, (v) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Transaction agreements, (vi) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Transaction on Xerox’s and/or Fujifilm’s business relationships, operating results, and business generally, risks related to the proposed Transaction disrupting Xerox’s current plans and operations and potential difficulties in Xerox’s employee retention as a result of the Transaction, (vii) risks related to diverting management’s attention from Xerox’s ongoing business operations, (viii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Xerox, its officers or directors related to the Transaction agreements or the Transaction and (ix) the possibility that competing offers or acquisition proposals for Xerox will be made. Xerox assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments, except as required by law.

Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. (“Fuji Xerox”) is a joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm in which Xerox holds a noncontrolling 25% equity interest and Fujifilm holds the remaining equity interest. Given our status as a minority investor, we have limited contractual and other rights to information with respect to Fuji Xerox matters. In April 2017, Fujifilm formed an independent investigation committee (the “IIC”) to primarily conduct a review of the appropriateness of the accounting practices at Fuji Xerox’s New Zealand subsidiary and at other subsidiaries. The IIC completed its review during the second quarter 2017 and identified aggregate adjustments to Fuji Xerox’s financial statements of approximately JPY 40 billion (approximately $360 million) primarily related to misstatements at Fuji Xerox’s New Zealand and Australian subsidiaries. We determined that our share of the total adjustments identified as part of the investigation was approximately $90 million and impacted our fiscal years 2009 through 2017. We revised our previously issued annual and interim consolidated financial statements for 2014, 2015 and 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. Fujifilm and Fuji Xerox continue to review Fujifilm’s oversight and governance of Fuji Xerox as well as Fuji Xerox’s oversight and governance over its businesses in light of the findings of the IIC. 

In 2018, in connection with the completion of audits of Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year-end financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, as well as the review of Fuji Xerox’s unaudited interim financial statements 

Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, additional adjustments and misstatements were identified. These additional adjustments and misstatements were to the net income of Fuji Xerox for the period from 2010 through 2017 previously revised for the items identified by the IIC noted above. At this time, we can provide no assurances relative to the outcome of any potential governmental investigations or any consequences thereof that may happen as a result of this matter.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)


Note 1 – Basis of Presentation

References herein to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “company” and “Xerox” refer to Xerox Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context suggests otherwise.

We have prepared the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the accounting policies described in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K ("2017 Annual Report") except as noted herein, and the interim reporting requirements of Form 10-Q. Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in our annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. You should read these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2017 Annual Report.

In our opinion, all adjustments which are necessary for a fair statement of financial position, operating results and cash flows for the interim periods presented have been made. These adjustments consist of normal recurring items. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results of the full year.

For convenience and ease of reference, we refer to the financial statement caption “Income (Loss) before Income Taxes and Equity Income” as “pre-tax income (loss).” 

Note 2 – Correction of Fuji Xerox Misstatement in Prior Period Financial Statements 

Fuji Xerox is a joint venture between Xerox Corporation and Fujifilm Holdings Corporation (“Fujifilm”) in which Xerox holds a noncontrolling 25% equity interest and Fujifilm holds the remaining equity interest. In 2017 Fujifilm publicly announced it had formed an independent investigation committee ("IIC") to conduct a review of the appropriateness of the accounting practices at Fuji Xerox’s New Zealand subsidiary related to the recovery of receivables associated with certain bundled leasing transactions that occurred in, or prior to, Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year ending March 31, 2016. 


In the second quarter 2017, we determined that the misstatements to our Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates in prior years and the first quarter of 2017 identified through the IIC's review were immaterial to our previously issued financial statements. However, we concluded that the cumulative correction of these misstatements would have had a material effect on our 2017 consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, we revised our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2017. The effect of the revision on our previously issued financial statements is provided in the tables below. Amounts throughout the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted to incorporate the revised amounts, where applicable.

Refer to Note 10 - Investment in Affiliates, at Equity for a discussion regarding the correction of incremental misstatements and adjustments identified in 2018 and corrected by Fuji Xerox as part of their reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 (our first quarter).

Note 3 – Adoption of New Revenue Recognition Standard


On January 1, 2018 we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606), which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASC Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASC Topic 606 defines a five step process to recognize revenue and requires more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process than required under previous U.S. GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. 

We adopted this standard using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Under ASC Topic 606, based on the nature of our contracts and consistent with prior practice, we recognize revenue upon invoicing the customer for the large majority of our revenue. Additionally, the unit of accounting, that is, the identification of performance obligations, is consistent with prior revenue recognition practice. Accordingly, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact for the large majority of our revenues. Lastly, a significant portion of our equipment sales are either recorded as sales-type leases or through direct sales to distributors and resellers and these revenue streams are not impacted by the adoption of ASC Topic 606. The only change of significance identified in our adoption involves a change in the classification of certain revenues that were previously reported in Services revenues. These revenues, which are approximately $50 annually, relate to certain analyst services performed in connection with the installation of equipment that are being considered part of the equipment sale performance obligation in 2018. Accordingly, in 2018 these revenues are now reported as part of Sales. In the first quarter of 2018, as result of this change, $9 of revenue was recorded as Sales, which would have been previously recorded as Services revenue in prior periods. 

Another change identified upon adoption was with respect to deferred contract costs, which include incremental costs of obtaining a contract and costs to fulfill a contract. Deferred contract costs had been minimal under our prior practices as most costs to obtain a contract and fulfill a contract were expensed as incurred. However, as a result of the contract cost guidance included in ASC Topic 606 and ASC Topic 340-40 "Contracts with Customers", upon adoption, we recorded a transition asset of $153, and a net of tax increase of $117 to retained earnings, related to the incremental cost to obtain contracts. Substantially all of this adjustment is related to the deferral of sales commissions paid to sales people and agents in connection with the placement of equipment with post sale service arrangements.






We generate revenue through the sale of equipment, supplies and maintenance and printing services. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer or in the period the customer benefits from the service. With the exception of our sales-type lease arrangements, our invoices to the customer, which normally have short-term payment terms, are typically aligned to the transfer of goods or as services are rendered to our customers and therefore in most cases we recognize revenue based on our right to invoice customers. As a result of the application of this practical expedient for the substantial portion of our revenue, the disclosure of the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for our services is not required.

Significant judgments primarily include the identification of performance obligations in our Document management services arrangements as well the pattern of delivery for those services. 



Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

location, revenue is normally recognized when the equipment has been delivered and installed at the customer location. Sales of customer installable products are recognized upon shipment or receipt by the customer according to the customer's shipping terms. Revenue from the equipment performance obligation also includes certain analyst training services performed in connection with the installation or delivery of the equipment.



Our services contracts may also include the sale or lease of equipment and software. In these instances we follow the policies noted for Equipment or Software Revenues and separately report the revenue associated with these performance obligations. Certain document management services arrangements may also include an embedded lease of equipment. In these instances the revenues associated with the lease are recognized in accordance with the requirements for lease accounting. 


Distributors and resellers participate in various rebate, price-protection, cooperative marketing and other programs, and we estimate the variable consideration associated with these programs and record those amounts as a reduction to revenue when the sales occur. Similarly, we account for our estimates of sales returns and other allowances when the sales occur based on our historical experience.

In certain instances, we may provide lease financing to end-user customers who purchased equipment we sold to distributors or resellers. We are not obligated to provide financing and we compete with other third-party leasing companies with respect to the lease financing provided to these end-user customers.


Revenues under bundled arrangements are allocated considering the relative standalone selling prices of the lease and non-lease deliverables included in the bundled arrangement. Lease deliverables include the equipment, financing, maintenance and other executory costs, while non-lease deliverables generally consist of the supplies and non-maintenance services. The allocation for the lease deliverables begins by allocating revenues to the maintenance and other executory costs plus a profit thereon. These elements are generally recognized over the term of the lease as 

Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

service revenue. The remaining amounts are allocated to the equipment and financing elements which are subjected to the accounting estimates noted below under “Leases”.


We consider the economic life of most of our products to be five years, since this represents the most frequent contractual lease term for our principal products and only a small percentage of our leases are for original terms longer than five years. There is no significant after-market for our used equipment. We believe five years is representative of the period during which the equipment is expected to be economically usable, with normal service, for the purpose for which it is intended. Residual values are not significant.

With respect to fair value, we perform an analysis of equipment fair value based on cash selling prices during the applicable period. The cash selling prices are compared to the range of values determined for our leases. The range of cash selling prices must be reasonably consistent with the lease selling prices in order for us to determine that such lease prices are indicative of fair value.

Our lease pricing interest rates, which are used in determining customer payments in a bundled lease arrangement, are developed based upon a variety of factors including local prevailing rates in the marketplace and the customer’s credit history, industry and credit class. We reassess our pricing interest rates quarterly based on changes in the local prevailing rates in the marketplace. These interest rates have generally been adjusted if the rates vary by 25 basis points or more, cumulatively, from the rate last in effect. The pricing interest rates generally equal the implicit rates within the leases, as corroborated by our comparisons of cash to lease selling prices.

Other Revenue Recognition Policies



In the first quarter 2018, incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract of $17 were deferred and amortization was $24. The balance of deferred incremental direct costs net of accumulated amortization at March 31, 2018 was $179. This amount is expected to be amortized over its estimated period of benefit, which we currently estimate to be approximately four years. 

We may also incur costs associated with our services arrangements to generate or enhance resources and assets that will be used to satisfy our future performance obligations included in these arrangements. These costs are considered contract fulfillment costs. These costs are amortized over the contractual service period of the arrangement to cost of services. In addition, we also provide inducements to certain customers in various forms, including contractual credits, which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract. Amounts deferred associated with contract fulfillment costs and inducements were $10 at March 31, 2018.

Equipment and software used in the fulfillment of service arrangements and where the company retains control are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of their useful life or the term of the contract if an asset is contract specific.



Note 4 – Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This update requires the recognition of leased assets and lease obligations by lessees for those leases currently classified as operating leases under existing lease guidance. Short term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not required to be recognized. The update also requires disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements to increase transparency and comparability among organizations. The accounting for lessors does not fundamentally change except for changes to conform and align guidance to the lessee guidance as well as to the new revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. The aggregate undiscounted value of our operating lease commitments at December 31, 2017 was approximately $450 and was primarily related to leases of facilities. 

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets. The update impacts financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements. 

Cash Flows

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This update provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues where current guidance is either unclear or does not include specific requirements. We adopted ASU 2016-15 effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018. This update includes specific guidance which requires cash collected on beneficial interests received in a sale of receivables be classified as inflows from investing activities. Currently, those collections are reported in operating cash flows. We reported $54 of collections on beneficial interests as operating cash inflows on the Statement of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Accordingly, since the update must be applied retrospectively, our reported 2017 operating and investing cash flows were revised in 2018 to report this amount as investing cash flows. There is no expected impact to our 2018 cash flows from this reporting change due to the termination of all accounts receivable sales arrangements in North America and most arrangements in Europe and the final repurchase of previously sold finance receivables during the fourth quarter of 2017. The other seven issues noted in this update are not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Additionally, in November 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash. The update requires that amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. We adopted ASU 2016-18 effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018 and applied it retrospectively through a revision of previously reported amounts. We held $76 and $75 of restricted cash, currently reported in other current or long-term assets at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The changes in our restricted cash balances were primarily related to our accounts receivable sales programs, which were terminated during the fourth quarter of 2017. Accordingly, this update is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 6 - Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash for additional information.

Business Combinations 


Income Taxes

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory. This update requires recognition of the income-tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Under current GAAP, recognition of the income tax consequences for asset transfers other than inventory could not be recognized until the asset was sold to a third party. We adopted ASU 2016-16 effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have nor is it expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) 

On December 31, 2016, Xerox completed the Separation of its BPO business through the Distribution of all of the issued and outstanding stock of Conduent to Xerox Corporation stockholders. As a result of the Separation and Distribution, the financial position and results of operations of the BPO business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented. The loss from operations in the first quarter 2017 primarily reflected changes in estimates of separation-related costs.



Note 6 – Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash



Restricted Cash 

Restricted cash primarily relates to escrow cash deposits made in Brazil associated with tax and labor litigation. As more fully discussed in Note 19 - Contingencies and Litigation, various litigation matters in Brazil require us to make cash deposits to escrow as a condition of continuing the litigation. Restricted cash amounts are classified in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets based on when the cash is expected to be contractually or judicially released.

Note 7 – Accounts Receivable, Net



Amounts to be invoiced in the subsequent quarter for current services provided are included in amounts accrued.

We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is determined principally on the basis of past collection experience as well as consideration of current economic conditions and changes in our customer collection trends. 

Accounts Receivable Sales Arrangements 

Accounts receivable sales arrangements are utilized in the normal course of business as part of our cash and liquidity management. The accounts receivable sold are generally short-term trade receivables with payment due dates of less than 60 days. During the fourth quarter 2017 we terminated all accounts receivable sales arrangements in North America and all but one arrangement in Europe. The remaining facility in Europe enables us to sell accounts receivable associated with our distributor network on an ongoing basis without recourse. Under this arrangement, we sell our entire interest in the related accounts receivable for cash and no portion of the payment is held back or deferred by the purchaser.

Of the accounts receivable sold and derecognized from our balance sheet, $114 and $161 remained uncollected as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

Note 10 – Investment in Affiliates, at Equity



Fuji Xerox

Equity in net (loss) income of Fuji Xerox is affected by certain adjustments required to reflect the deferral of profit associated with intercompany sales. These adjustments may result in recorded equity (loss) income that is different from that implied by our 25% ownership interest. In addition, the Equity in net loss of Fuji Xerox for the three months ended March 31, 2018 includes $79 of after-tax restructuring and other charges.

In 2018, in connection with the completion of the audits of Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year-end financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, as well the review of Fuji Xerox’s unaudited interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 additional adjustments and misstatements were identified. These additional adjustments and misstatements were to the previously reported net income of Fuji Xerox for the period from 2010 through 2017 and are incremental to the items identified by the IIC discussed in Note 2 - Correction of Fuji Xerox Misstatement in Prior Period Financial Statements. These incremental adjustments primarily relate to Fuji Xerox’s Asia Pacific subsidiaries and involve improper revenue recognition, including revenue associated with leasing transactions, additional provisions for bad debt allowances and other asset impairments. In certain instances, some of the adjustments related to inappropriate accounting and reporting practices in the Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific subsidiaries where previous misstatements were identified.

Note 11 – Restructuring Programs

During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we recorded net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $28, which included $24 of severance costs related to headcount reductions of approximately 400 employees worldwide and $12 of lease cancellation costs. These costs were partially offset by $8 of net reversals, primarily resulting from changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives. Costs related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the Strategic Transformation program were minimal.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management


•Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities

•Forecasted purchases and sales in foreign currency

At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had outstanding forward exchange and purchased option contracts with gross notional values of $1,557 and $1,788 respectively, with terms of less than 12 months. Approximately 70% of the contracts at March 31, 2018 mature within three months, 20% mature in three to six months and 10% in six to twelve months. The associated currency exposures being hedged at March 31, 2018 were materially consistent with our year-end currency exposures. There has not been any material change in our hedging strategy.

Foreign Currency Cash Flow Hedges

We designate a portion of our foreign currency derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of our foreign currency-denominated inventory purchases, sales and expenses. The net asset (liability) fair value of these contracts were $4 and $(14) as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

Summary of Derivative Instruments Fair Value



Summary of Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)

Derivative gains (losses) affect the income statement based on whether such derivatives are designated as hedges of underlying exposures. The following is a summary of derivative gains (losses).

Designated Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)



During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 no amount of ineffectiveness was recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for these designated cash flow hedges and all components of each derivative’s gain or (loss) were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. In addition, no amount was recorded for an underlying exposure that did not occur or was not expected to occur.

As of March 31, 2018, a net after-tax gain of $5 was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with our cash flow hedging activity. The entire balance is expected to be reclassified into net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions.

Non-Designated Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)

Non-designated derivative instruments are primarily instruments used to hedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. They are not designated as hedges since there is a natural offset for the re-measurement of the underlying foreign currency-denominated asset or liability.

We utilize the income approach to measure the fair value for our derivative assets and liabilities. The income approach uses pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves, currency exchange rates and forward prices, and therefore are classified as Level 2.

Fair value for our deferred compensation plan investments in mutual funds is based on quoted market prices for those funds. Fair value for deferred compensation plan liabilities is based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment selections.

Summary of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities 



The fair value amounts for Cash and cash equivalents and Accounts receivable, net, approximate carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair value of Short and Long-term debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to us for debt of similar maturities (Level 2). The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at such date.

Note 19 – Contingencies and Litigation

Legal Matters


Brazil Tax and Labor Contingencies

Our Brazilian operations are involved in various litigation matters and have received or been the subject of numerous governmental assessments related to indirect and other taxes, as well as disputes associated with former employees and contract labor. The tax matters, which comprise a significant portion of the total contingencies, principally relate to claims for taxes on the internal transfer of inventory, municipal service taxes on rentals and gross revenue taxes. We are disputing these tax matters and intend to vigorously defend our positions. Based on the opinion of legal counsel and current reserves for those matters deemed probable of loss, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The labor matters principally relate to claims made by former employees and contract labor for the equivalent payment of all social security and other related labor benefits, as well as consequential tax claims, as if they were regular employees. As of March 31, 2018, the total amounts related to the unreserved portion of the tax and labor contingencies, inclusive of any related interest, amounted to approximately $585, with the decrease from our December 31, 2017 balance of approximately $600, primarily related to closed cases, partially offset by interest. With respect to the unreserved balance of $585, the majority has been assessed by management as being remote as to the likelihood of ultimately resulting in a loss to the company. In connection with the above proceedings, customary local regulations may require us to make escrow cash deposits or post other security of up to half of the total amount in dispute. As of March 31, 2018, we had $72 of escrow cash deposits for matters we are disputing and additional letters of credit and surety bonds of approximately $131 and $107, respectively, which include associated indexation. There were no liens on any of our Brazilian assets as of March 31, 2018. Generally, any escrowed amounts would be refundable and any liens would be removed to the extent the matters are resolved in our favor. We routinely assess all these matters as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability against our Brazilian operations and record our best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where we assess the likelihood of an ultimate loss as probable.

Litigation Against the Company


Another complaint filed by Darwin Deason, a Xerox shareholder, against Xerox and its directors in the same Court on March 2, 2018 alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by refusing Mr. Deason’s request for a waiver of the deadline for nomination of a new slate of Xerox directors, and seeks to enjoin Xerox and its directors from 

Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

enforcing Xerox’s advance notice by-laws, thereby allowing Mr. Deason to proceed with the nominations, as well as costs, fees, and other relief. 

On April 27, 2018, the Court issued decisions and orders granting plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions, which (i) enjoin Xerox from “taking any further action to consummate the change of control transaction between Xerox and Fuji that was announced on January 31, 2018 pending a final determination of the claims asserted in the underlying action;” (ii) enjoin Xerox from enforcing its advance notice bylaw provision requiring shareholders to nominate directors for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting by December 11, 2017; and (iii) require Xerox to waive such advance notice bylaw provision to permit the noticing of a slate of director nominees for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting, and denying defendants’ motions to dismiss. 

On May 1, 2018, Xerox entered into a Director Appointment, Nomination and Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, among others, that would have resolved the pending proxy contest in connection with Xerox’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, as well as the ongoing litigation brought by Mr. Deason against Xerox and its directors related to the proposed Fuji Transaction. The agreement expired by its terms on May 3, 2018 without becoming effective. 

On May 7, 2018, defendants filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department, notices of appeal of, and motions to stay pending appeal, the lower Court’s decision and order. Defendants also moved the appellate court for interim relief ordering that the appeal be heard on an expedited basis. At a hearing before the appellate court on May 7, 2018, the appellate court ruled that the appeals would be heard on an expedited basis and granted a partial interim stay allowing Xerox and Fujifilm to take steps to seek regulatory approvals related to the Fuji Transaction pending a ruling from the appellate court on defendants’ motions to stay pending appeal.

Xerox believes the lawsuits are meritless and will vigorously defend them. At this time, however, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in these litigations. Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs, including an inability to close the proposed transactions.



Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

On February 28, 2017, the Court issued an opinion and order appointing the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System ("APERS") as lead plaintiff. On May 1, 2017, APERS filed an amended complaint, alleging substantially similar claims and seeking substantially similar relief, but adding David Bywater and Mary Scanlon as defendants. On June 30, 2017, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint, and the motions were fully briefed on October 13, 2017. On March 20, 2018, the Court entered an opinion and order granting the motions, and on March 23, 2018, the Court entered a judgment of dismissal and closed the case. On April 20, 2018, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Xerox will vigorously defend against this matter. At this time, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in this litigation. Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs.

Other Contingencies

We have issued or provided approximately $366 of guarantees as of March 31, 2018 in the form of letters of credit or surety bonds issued to i) support certain insurance programs; ii) support our obligations related to the Brazil tax and labor contingencies; and iii) support certain contracts, primarily with public sector customers, which require us to provide a surety bond as a guarantee of our performance of contractual obligations.

In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract; the probability of which we believe is remote. We believe that our capacity in the surety markets as well as under various credit arrangements (including our Credit Facility) is sufficient to allow us to respond to future requests for proposals that require such credit support.

Fuji Xerox Transaction Overview


•Redemption and Issuance - Fuji Xerox will redeem most of the shares of Fuji Xerox owned by Fujifilm in exchange for cash. Immediately following the Redemption, Fujifilm will contribute to Xerox the cash it received in the Redemption and all shares of Fuji Xerox still held by Fujifilm after giving effect to the Redemption and, in exchange therefore, Xerox will issue to Fujifilm a number of shares of Xerox common stock such that Fujifilm will own 50.1% of the Xerox common stock, on a fully diluted basis, at the closing of the transactions (the “Closing”), a portion of which will be held in escrow in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Agreements. As a result of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (referred to herein as the "combination"), Fuji Xerox will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox and Xerox will become a direct, majority owned subsidiary of Fujifilm (with the remainder of Xerox continuing to be owned by Xerox’s existing shareholders). The escrowed shares will be released from escrow upon, among other things, (i) the conversion of any shares of Xerox Series B Convertible

Table of Contents 


As previously announced, the Company and Fujifilm have been in discussions about improving the terms of their announced transaction. In connection with such discussions, the Company has had correspondence with Fujifilm as to whether Xerox has the right to terminate the Subscription Agreement.

Fuji Xerox has been determined to be the accounting acquirer and Xerox to be the accounting acquiree under the acquisition method of accounting based on various considerations. As noted above, immediately following the Closing, Fujifilm, the former parent of Fuji Xerox, is expected to own approximately 50.1% of the fully diluted capital stock of new Fuji Xerox and the other Xerox shareholders are expected to own approximately 49.9%. Further, pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, to be entered into by Xerox and Fujifilm at Closing (the “Shareholders Agreement”), the board of directors of new Fuji Xerox will have twelve directors, which will initially be composed of seven individuals designated by Fujifilm (including the current CEO of Xerox) and five individuals from among the members of the board of directors of Xerox immediately prior to Closing designated by Xerox in consultation with and subject to reasonable approval by Fujifilm. Accordingly, the combination is expected to be accounted for as a reverse acquisition as per ASC Topic 805-40 "Business Combinations - Reverse Acquisitions".


The completion of the Fujifilm Transactions will require Xerox shareholder approval as well as customary regulatory approvals, filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, tax considerations, and securing any necessary financing. Until the combination is complete, each of Xerox, Fuji Xerox and Fujifilm will continue to be separate, independent organizations and will operate as usual.

Bridge Facility

On January 31, 2018, Xerox entered into a Commitment Letter with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., which provides a commitment, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, for a $2.5 billion unsecured bridge loan facility. This facility would be available for Xerox to pay the special one-time cash dividend of $2.5 billion to existing shareholders of Xerox as described herein. Xerox has not borrowed funds nor does it currently plan to borrow funds from this facility, rather, prior to closing, Xerox intends to secure alternative financing to meet its obligation to pay the special dividend. At March 31, 2018, we had approximately $11 of debt issuance costs deferred in connection with this facility, which are currently being amortized over the remainder of the year, and another $6 was paid in the second quarter 2018, which will also be deferred and amortized. Xerox may also secure financing to fund approximately $350 required to settle certain of Xerox's obligations in respect of unfunded supplemental pension plans and deferred compensation plans which will accelerate in connection with the combination (such accelerated payments, the "change-in-control payments").

ITEM 2 — MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Throughout this document, references to “we,” “our,” the “company,” and “Xerox” refer to Xerox Corporation and its subsidiaries. References to “Xerox Corporation” refer to the stand-alone parent company and do not include its subsidiaries.

Currency Impact

To better understand the trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars on revenue and expenses. We refer to this analysis as "constant currency", “currency impact” or “the impact from currency.” This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate. This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates. The constant currency impact for signings growth is calculated on the basis of plan currency rates.

Fuji Xerox Adjustments


In 2018, in connection with the completion of the audits of Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year-end financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, as well as the review of Fuji Xerox’s unaudited interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, additional adjustments and misstatements were identified. These additional adjustments and misstatements were to the previously reported net income of Fuji Xerox for the period from 2010 through 2017 and are incremental to the items identified by the IIC noted above. These incremental adjustments primarily relate to Fuji Xerox’s Asia Pacific subsidiaries and involve improper revenue recognition, including revenue associated with leasing transactions, additional provisions for bad debt allowances and other asset impairments. In certain instances, some of the adjustments related to inappropriate accounting and reporting practices in the Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific subsidiaries and are further evidence of inadequate management oversight and an insufficient entity level monitoring system for financial statements of subsidiaries beyond what was previously identified by the IIC. Fuji Xerox is committed to implementing additional measures to remediate these newly identified issues.

First Quarter 2018 Review

Total revenue of $2.44 billion for first quarter 2018 declined 0.8% from first quarter 2017 including a 3.8-percentage point favorable impact from currency. Post-sale revenue, which primarily reflects contracted services, equipment maintenance, supplies and financing, were $1.94 billion and represented 80% of total revenues. Post-sale revenue, declined 0.3% including a 3.8-percentage point favorable impact from currency. The decline in post-sale revenue primarily reflected continuing lower page volume trends and a lower population of devices as well as the higher mix of installs of lower usage devices. These declines were partially offset by higher revenues from our Managed Document Services and Global Imaging business. Equipment revenues of $499 million declined by 2.7%, including a 3.7-percentage point favorable impact from currency. Excluding the impact from currency, equipment revenues declined across all product areas and reflected price declines of approximately 5% as well as the follow-on impact of higher entry and mid-range sales in fourth quarter 2017 related to the expansion of our U.S. indirect channels. The decline in equipment sales also reflected the overall market decline trends, unfavorable mix and lower revenues from our OEM business.

Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $23 million and included after-tax costs of $155 million related to the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, transaction and related costs, non-service retirement-related costs and other discrete adjustments, resulting in adjusted1 net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox of $178 million. Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $46 million and included after-tax costs of $130 million related to the amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, non-service retirement-related costs and other discrete adjustments, resulting in adjusted1 net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox of $176 million. The decrease in net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to lower equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates, which included our share of a significant restructuring charge recorded by Fuji Xerox, transaction and related costs and higher income taxes. These impacts were partially offset by lower restructuring and related costs and non-service retirement-related costs. The increase in adjusted1 net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the prior year period was primarily related to increased operating profits reflecting the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements, which offset the decline in revenues, as well as lower interest expense and a gain on the sale of non-core assets. These impacts were partially offset by lower equity income from unconsolidated affiliates and higher income taxes.

Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $216 million, as compared to $132 million for the prior year period. The increase is primarily due to improved operating profits, working capital2 and the prior year reclassification of $54 million of collections of deferred proceeds and beneficial interests from the sale of receivables to investing cash flows as a result of an accounting change (Refer to Note 4 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).

Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $2 million and included capital expenditures (including internal use software) of $18 million which were partially offset by proceeds of $16 million from the sale of non-core business assets. Cash used in financing activities of $117 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily reflects payments of $25 million related to the termination of a capital lease obligation and $13 million of bridge facility costs, as well as dividend payments of $67 million.

Financial Review

Revenues


CC - See "Currency Impact" section for a description of Constant Currency.





Post sale revenue primarily reflects contracted services, equipment maintenance, supplies and financing. These revenues are associated with the population of devices in the field, which is affected by installs and removals, as well as the page volumes generated by the usage of such devices and the revenue per printed page. Post sale revenue decreased 0.3% as compared to first quarter 2017, with a 3.8-percentage point favorable impact from currency. 

•Services, maintenance and rentals revenue includes rental and maintenance revenue (including bundled supplies) as well as the post sale component of the document services revenue from our Managed Document Services (MDS) offerings, and revenues from our Communication and Marketing Solutions (CMS). These revenues decreased 0.8%, with a 4.3-percentage point favorable impact from currency. The decline at constant currency1 reflected the continuing trends of lower page volumes and a lower population of devices, which are partially associated with lower signings and installs in prior periods, as well as the impact of a higher mix of installs of lower usage products. These impacts are partially offset by higher revenues from MDS driven by our SMB-focused channels, along with revenues from acquisitions within our Global Imaging business and higher revenues from developing markets. 

•Supplies, paper and other sales includes unbundled supplies and other sales. These revenues were flat compared to the first quarter of 2017, with a 2.4-percentage point favorable impact from currency. The decline at constant currency1 was driven by continued declines in equipment manufacturer (OEM) supplies as well as lower supplies demand consistent with a lower population of devices in the field, partially offset by higher supplies sales within our Global Imaging business. 

Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 

•Financing revenue is generated from financed equipment sale transactions. The 6.6% decline in these revenues reflected a declining finance receivables balance due to lower equipment sales in prior periods and included a 4.0-percentage point favorable impact from currency. 



CC - See "Currency Impact" section for a description of Constant Currency.



Equipment sales revenue decreased 2.7% as compared to first quarter 2017, with a 3.7-percentage point favorable impact from currency and was impacted by price declines of approximately 5% (which were in-line with our historic declines). This decrease also reflected the follow-on impact of higher entry and mid-range sales in fourth quarter 2017 related to the expansion of our U.S. indirect channels. The decline at constant currency1 in entry sales reflected in part higher sales in the prior year related to the indirect channels transition to the new products as well as lower revenues within our indirect channel in the current year, and a higher mix of low-end personal devices mainly in our developing markets. Mid-range declined modestly at constant currency1 reflecting higher installs of new products offset by ongoing declines consistent with overall market trends. The decrease at constant currency1 in high-end sales primarily reflected lower revenues from iGen and continuous feed systems due in part to timing of installs in the prior year, as well as lower revenues from black-and-white systems consistent with market decline trends; these declines were partially mitigated by higher activity from the Versant entry production color systems that were launched in the second quarter of 2017. 

Total Installs 

Revenue associated with equipment installations, discussed below, may be reflected up-front in Equipment sales or over time either through rental income or as part of our Managed Document Services revenues (which are both reported within our post-sale revenues), depending on the terms and conditions of our agreements with customers.



•4% increase in color multifunction devices, reflecting demand for recently launched products.

•18% increase in black-and-white multifunction devices, driven largely by higher activity for low-end devices in developing markets. 


•16% increase in mid-range color installs, reflecting higher demand for recently launched products.

•11% increase in mid-range black-and-white, as demand for recently launched products more than offset market trends.


•6% increase in high-end color systems, as growth from Versant products offset lower installs of higher-end color systems. 

•9% decrease in high-end black-and-white systems reflecting market trends.

Signings




CC - See "Currency Impact" section for a description of Constant Currency.

First quarter 2018 signings decreased 0.6% from first quarter 2017, with a 1.4-percentage point favorable impact from currency, reflecting lower contribution from new business. On a trailing twelve month (TTM) basis, signings increased 1.1% from the comparable prior year period, with a 0.5-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. 

New business TCV decreased 5.2% from first quarter 2017, with a 1.4-percentage point favorable impact from currency, and decreased 12.2% at constant currency1 on a TTM basis, led by lower signings in Europe. 

Renewal Rate

Renewal rate is defined as the annual recurring revenue (ARR) on contracts that are renewed during the period as a percentage of ARR on all contracts for which a renewal decision was made during the period. Contract renewal rate for the first quarter 2018 was 85%, compared to our full year 2017 renewal rate of 84%.

Costs, Expenses and Other Income 

Summary of Key Financial Ratios





Pre-tax Income (Loss) Margin

First quarter 2018 pre-tax income margin of 5.5% increased 6.2-percentage points as compared to first quarter 2017. The increase was primarily driven by lower restructuring and related costs that reflected the phasing of our strategic transformation initiatives, as well as lower Other expense, net partially offset by Transaction related costs.


First quarter 2018 adjusted1 operating margin of 10.4% decreased 0.6-percentage points as compared to first quarter 2017, reflecting a 1.2-percentage point impact from lower Equity in income (associated with our share of Fuji Xerox net income), partially offset by improvement in other areas of our business as a result of cost savings, including savings from strategic transformation which more than offset the impact of revenue decline and investments in the business. Adjusted1 operating margin includes favorable transaction currency of 0.7-percentage points.



Gross Margin

First quarter 2018 gross margin of 39.8% increased by 0.1-percentage points compared to first quarter 2017. This performance reflected cost productivity savings, along with favorable transaction currency of 0.7-percentage points partially offset by the impact of lower revenues.

First quarter 2018 equipment gross margin of 32.3% increased 1.6-percentage points as compared to first quarter 2017, reflecting benefits from transaction currency and cost productivity savings.

First quarter 2018 post sale gross margin of 41.8% decreased 0.3-percentage points as compared to first quarter 2017 reflecting in part, the impact of lower revenues, partially offset by net productivity savings as well as favorable transaction currency.



Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 



Selling, Administrative and General Expenses (SAG)

SAG as a percentage of revenue of 25.8% was flat compared to first quarter 2017. 

SAG of $628 million was $6 million lower than first quarter 2017, including an approximate $19 million unfavorable impact from currency as well as $9 million of accelerated depreciation related to the early termination of a capital lease associated with a surplus facility. These adverse impacts were more than offset by cost savings, including restructuring savings, partially offset by higher compensation and benefit expense as well as expenses from Global Imaging acquisitions. Bad debt expense of $13 million was flat compared to first quarter 2017 and remained at less than one percent of receivables.

Restructuring and Related Costs

First quarter 2018 restructuring and related costs of $28 million included $24 million of severance costs related to headcount reductions of approximately 400 employees worldwide and $12 million of lease cancellation charges reflecting continued optimization of our operating locations. These costs were partially offset by $8 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives. First quarter 2018 actions impacted several functional areas, with approximately 55% focused on gross margin improvements and approximately 45% on SAG reductions. Costs related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the Strategic Transformation program were minimal.

First quarter 2017 restructuring and related costs of $118 million included net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $108 million as well as $10 million of additional costs primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the Strategic Transformation program.


The restructuring reserve balance as of March 31, 2018 for all programs was $85 million, of which $82 million is expected to be spent over the next twelve months. 

Refer to Note 11 - Restructuring Programs in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring programs.

Transaction and Related Costs

During first quarter 2018, we recorded costs of $36 million related to Xerox's planned combination transaction with Fuji Xerox, which is currently halted as a result of a court injunction. These costs were primarily for third-party investment banking, accounting, legal, consulting and other similar types of services as well as certain employee-related costs associated with the planned combination. These costs will also include additional expenses expected to be incurred in the second quarter 2018 for third-party legal and other related costs associated with the ongoing litigation with certain shareholders as well as other related matters.

Amortization of Intangible Assets

First quarter 2018 amortization of intangible assets of $12 million was $2 million lower than first quarter 2017. 

Worldwide Employment

Worldwide employment was approximately 35,000 as of March 31, 2018 and decreased by approximately 300 from December 31, 2017. The reduction is primarily due to the impact of restructuring and productivity-related reductions.

Other Expenses, Net


Non-Financing Interest Expense

First quarter 2018 non-financing interest expense of $31 million was $5 million lower than first quarter 2017. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense declined by $4 million from first quarter 2017 due to a lower debt balance reflecting debt repayments of approximately $1.3 billion in the first quarter 2017 partially offset by $1.0 billion of new debt issued in the third quarter 2017 to fund, among other things, a $500 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans; the decline also reflected lower average interest rates.

Non-Service Retirement-Related Costs

First quarter 2018 non-service retirement-related costs were $35 million lower than first quarter 2017, primarily driven by lower losses from pension settlements and the favorable impact of higher pension contributions and asset returns in the prior year.

Gains on Sales of Businesses and Assets

First quarter 2018 gains on sales of businesses and assets of $16 million reflected the sale of non-core business assets.

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt

During the first quarter of 2017, we recorded a $13 million loss associated with the repayment of $300 million in Senior Notes.

Income Taxes



Our effective tax rate is based on nonrecurring events as well as recurring factors, including the taxation of foreign income. In addition, our effective tax rate will change based on discrete or other nonrecurring events that may not be predictable.

Table of Contents 

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”)

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering the U.S. statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and implementing a territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

During the fourth quarter 2017, we recorded an estimated non-cash charge of $400 million reflecting the impact associated with the provisions of the Tax Act based on currently available information. Our estimated charge incorporates assumptions made based on our current interpretation of the Tax Act as well as currently available information and may change, possibly materially, as we complete our analysis and receive additional clarification and implementation guidance. Changes in interpretations and assumptions as well as actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act may also impact this estimated charge. The $400 million estimated provisional charge continues to be our best estimate of the impacts from the Tax Act and no further adjustment of that charge was made in the first quarter 2018. However, we continue to evaluate the impacts from the Tax Act and likely will do so through the expected filing of our 2017 U.S. Tax Return in the third quarter 2018. Any adjustments to these provisional amounts will be reported as a component of Income tax expense in the reporting period in which any such adjustments are determined.

Effective January 1, 2018, we became subject to several provisions of the Tax Act including computations related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ("GILTI"), Foreign Derived Intangible Income ("FDII"), Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax ("BEAT"), and IRC Section 163(j) interest limitation (Interest Limitation). Our current estimate for the GILTI, FDII and Interest Limitation rules was determined to be immaterial, however we currently estimate that we are subject to BEAT. Accordingly, our first quarter 2018 effective tax rate includes the estimated impact for BEAT, which has also been incorporated into our estimated annual effective tax for 2018. Similar to the provisional charge recorded in the fourth quarter 2017 associated with the enactment of the Tax Act, the estimates for these additional provisions of the Tax Act were made based on our current interpretation of the Tax Act as well as currently available information and may change, as we complete our analysis and receive additional clarification and implementation guidance. Changes in interpretations and assumptions as well as actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act may also impact these estimates.

Equity in Net (Loss) Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates 


Equity in net (loss) income of unconsolidated affiliates primarily reflects our 25% share of Fuji Xerox net loss. First quarter 2018 equity loss of $68 million included an approximate $28 million charge related to the out-of-period adjustments described in Note 10 - Investments in Affiliates, at Equity in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and in the "Fuji Xerox Adjustments" section above, and was $108 million worse compared to first quarter 2017, including $79 million of higher year-over-year charges related to our share of Fuji Xerox after-tax restructuring and other charges. Other charges included costs associated with the combination transaction.

We have revised Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates for the prior year period presented throughout this document. Refer to Note 2 - Correction of Fuji Xerox Misstatement in Prior Period Financial Statements in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on this revision.

Net Income from Continuing Operations

First quarter 2018 net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox was $23 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. On an adjusted1 basis, net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox was $178 million, or $0.68 per diluted share. First quarter 2018 adjustments to net income include restructuring and related costs, amortization of intangible assets, transaction and related costs and non-service retirement-related costs as well as other discrete, unusual or infrequent items as described in our Non-GAAP Financial Measures section.

First quarter 2017 net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox was $46 million, or $0.16 per diluted share. On an adjusted1 basis, net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox was $176 million, or $0.67 per diluted share. First quarter 2017 adjustments to net income include restructuring and related costs, amortization of intangible assets, and non-service retirement-related costs as well as other discrete, unusual or infrequent items as described in our Non-GAAP Financial Measures section.

Discontinued Operations 

Discontinued operations relate to our Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) business, which was separated effective December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 5 - Divestitures in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations. 

Net Income

First quarter 2018 net income attributable to Xerox was $23 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. First quarter 2017 net income attributable to Xerox was $40 million, or $0.14 per diluted share.

Other Comprehensive Income

First quarter 2018 Other comprehensive income attributable to Xerox was $211 million as compared to $166 million in first quarter 2017. The $45 million increase is primarily due to a $43 million increase in net translation adjustment gains of $176 million for the first quarter 2018 as compared to $133 million for the first quarter 2017. The increase reflected a greater strengthening of our major foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar in first quarter 2018 as compared to the prior year period. Additionally, 2018 Other comprehensive income included a $9 million year-over-year benefit from higher net unrealized gains on derivatives. Both the net translation adjustment gains and net unrealized gains were offset by lower net year-over-year changes in defined benefits of $8 million.

Refer to Note 13 - Financial Instruments in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding derivatives, and Note 15 - Employee Benefit Plans in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding net changes in our defined benefit plans.

Financial Risk Management


We are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet. As permitted, certain of these derivative contracts have been designated for hedge accounting treatment. Certain of our derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are effective as economic hedges. These derivative contracts are likewise required to be recognized each period at fair value and therefore do result in some level of volatility. The level of volatility will vary with the type and amount of derivative hedges outstanding, as well as fluctuations in the currency and interest rate markets during the period. The related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.

By their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange and interest rate movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. We do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a diversified group of major financial institutions. Further, our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating. Credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties.

The current market events have not required us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risk. Refer to Note 13 – Financial Instruments in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and information on our financial risk management strategies.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We have reported our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, we have discussed our financial results using the non-GAAP measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related income tax effects.


These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted Earnings Measures

•Net income and Earnings per share (EPS)

•Effective tax rate







Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents 


•2018 - Bridge facility costs relate to the previously disclosed $2.5 billion bridge loan facility, which was entered into in the first quarter 2018 to provide funding for the payment of the expected $2.5 billion dividend associated with the Fuji Xerox combination transaction in the event Xerox does not secure permanent financing. Since these costs are related to the Fuji Xerox combination transaction, the exclusion was considered consistent with Transaction and related costs discussed above.

•2017 - Loss on early extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2017.

•2017 - A benefit from the remeasurement of a tax matter in the first quarter of 2017 that related to a previously adjusted item.

We believe the exclusion of these items allows investors to better understand and analyze the results for the period as compared to prior periods and expected future trends in our business.

Refer to "Currency Impact" for a discussion of this measure and its use in our analysis of revenue growth. 

Summary

Management believes that all of these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current period’s results against the corresponding prior period’s results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures.
