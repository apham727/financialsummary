 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  

  1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies   

  Basis of Presentation   

 The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity" or the "Company," which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") and the instructions to Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In management's opinion, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of interim results. The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire fiscal year or any subsequent interim period.  

 The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018.  

 Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 are to our fiscal years ending September 27, 2019 and ended September 28, 2018, respectively.   

  Revenue Recognition   

 We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which introduced a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model. Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract, such as a purchase order with a customer, are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control. We transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers, the customers accept and have legal title for the product, and we have a right to payment for such product. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations, we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities. Our credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient of ASC 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations as of December 28, 2018. See Note 15 for net sales disaggregated by industry end market and geographic region which is summarized by segment and that we consider meaningful to depict the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows affected by economic factors.  

 We generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time. We limit our warranty to the replacement or repair of defective parts, or a refund or credit of the  


Table of Contents

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued)  

  1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (Continued)  

price of the defective product. We do not account for these warranties as separate performance obligations.  

 Although products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly. Our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us.   

  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements   

 In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2017-12, an update to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The update improves and simplifies hedge accounting and related disclosures. We elected to early adopt this update, which did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in the quarter ended December 28, 2018.  

 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, an update to ASC 740, Income Taxes. This guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory in the period in which the transfer occurs. The update was adopted on a modified retrospective basis in the quarter ended December 28, 2018 and resulted in a $443 million cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings, which represented the net reversal of all balances associated with deferred tax impacts of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This included a decrease in other assets of $798 million, an increase in deferred tax assets of $418 million, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $63 million on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 which codified ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This guidance supersedes ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and introduces a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model. ASC 606 also enhances disclosures related to revenue recognition. We adopted ASC 606, as amended, in the quarter ended December 28, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. Transition impacts, which relate primarily to incentive compensation arrangements, were not material to our results of operations or financial position. Because the impact of adoption was immaterial, we have not recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings.

  2. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net  






 During fiscal 2019, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements impacting all segments. In connection with this program, during the quarter ended December 28, 2018, we recorded restructuring charges of $67 million. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during the quarter ended December 28, 2018 by the end of fiscal 2020 and to incur additional charges of approximately $10 million primarily in the Industrial Solutions segment.   


 During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions

segments. In connection with this program, during the quarters ended December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017, we recorded restructuring charges of $3 million and $22 million, respectively. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2018 by the end of fiscal 2020 and to incur additional charges of approximately $10 million primarily in the Industrial Solutions segment.   


 Prior to fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting all segments. Also prior to fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment. During the quarters ended December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017, we recorded net restructuring charges of $5 million and $12 million, respectively, related to pre-fiscal 2018 actions. We expect additional charges related to pre-fiscal 2018 actions to be insignificant.   

  Total Restructuring Reserves   




 During the quarter ended December 28, 2018, we sold our Subsea Communications ("SubCom") business for net cash proceeds of $288 million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $96 million, related primarily to the recognition of cumulative translation adjustment losses of $67 million. The transaction is subject to a final working capital adjustment. The SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and was reported as such in all periods presented on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the SubCom business was included in the Communications Solutions segment.  

 In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business' projects that existed as of the date of sale. These guarantees have a combined value of approximately $1.7 billion and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025; however, the majority are expected to expire within two years. At the time of sale, we determined that the fair value of these guarantees was $12 million, which we recognized by a charge to pre-tax loss on sale. Also, under the terms of the definitive agreement, we are required to issue up to $300 million of new performance guarantees, subject to certain limitations, for projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale for a period of up to three years. During the quarter ended December 28, 2018, we issued a guarantee of $70 million for a new project. We have

contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on any SubCom guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform.

  6. Intangible Assets, Net (Continued)  




 During November 2018, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our 100%-owned subsidiary, issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due June 2020. The notes bear interest at a rate of three-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.45% per year. The notes are TEGSA's unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.  

 During December 2018, TEGSA repaid, at maturity, $325 million 2.375% senior notes due 2018.  

 TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with total commitments of $1,500 million. The Credit Facility was amended in November 2018 primarily to extend the maturity date from December 2020 to November 2023. The amended Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to $500 million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 28, 2018 or September 28, 2018.  

 As of December 28, 2018, TEGSA had $333 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.94%. TEGSA had $270 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.35% at September 28, 2018.  

 The fair value of our debt, based on indicative valuations, was approximately $4,091 million and $4,149 million at December 28, 2018 and September 28, 2018, respectively.

  8. Commitments and Contingencies   

  Legal Proceedings   

 In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.   

  Environmental Matters   

 We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. As of December 28, 2018, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $15 million to $44 million, and we accrued $17 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.   

  Guarantees   


 At December 28, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $286 million.  

 We sold our SubCom business during the quarter ended December 28, 2018. In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to honor certain performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business. See Note 3 for additional information regarding these guarantees and the divestiture of the SubCom business.

  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk   

 During fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of €1,000 million to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans. Under the terms of these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, we make interest payments in euros at 3.50% per annum and receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 5.33% per annum. Upon maturity of these contracts in fiscal 2022, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in euros and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties. In connection with the cross-currency swap contracts, we are required to post cash collateral with our counterparties.  




  Hedge of Net Investment   

 During fiscal 2019, we expanded our cross-currency swap program to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations. The aggregate notional value of this program was $952 million at December 28, 2018. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 3.06% per annum and pay no interest. Upon maturity of these contracts at various dates through fiscal 2022, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in the designated foreign currency and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties.  

 In addition to the cross-currency swap program, we hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany loans and external borrowings denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $3,189 million and $4,064 million at December 28, 2018 and September 28, 2018, respectively.

 TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.  

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued)  


 We recorded income tax expense of $78 million and $599 million for the quarters ended December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017, respectively. The income tax expense for the quarter ended December 29, 2017 included $567 million of income tax expense related to the tax impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") and a $61 million net income tax benefit related to certain legal entity restructurings. During the quarter ended December 29, 2017, the period of enactment of the Act, we were required to revalue our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at a U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 21% and we recorded income tax expense of $567 million primarily in connection with the write-down of our U.S. federal deferred tax asset for net operating loss and interest carryforwards. Included in the expense of $567 million was an income tax benefit of $34 million related to the reduction in the existing valuation allowance recorded against certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards.  

 We record accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense. As of December 28, 2018 and September 28, 2018, we had $63 million and $60 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, recorded primarily in income taxes.  

 Although it is difficult to predict the timing or results of our worldwide examinations, we estimate that up to approximately $125 million of unrecognized income tax benefits, excluding the impact relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months.  

 We are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 28, 2018.   

  Tax Sharing Agreement   

 Under a Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International plc ("Tyco International"), and Covidien plc ("Covidien") share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to the collective income tax returns for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. We have substantially settled all U.S. federal income tax matters with the IRS for periods covered under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Certain shared U.S. state and non-U.S. income tax matters remain open. We do not expect these matters will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. As a result of subsequent transactions, Tyco International and Covidien now operate as part of Johnson Controls International plc and Medtronic plc, respectively.

  12. Earnings (Loss) Per Share  



 There were one million share options that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share for the quarters ended December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017 because the instruments' underlying exercise prices were greater than the average market prices of our common shares and inclusion would be antidilutive.  

 For the quarter ended December 29, 2017, there were three million nonvested share awards and options outstanding with underlying exercise prices less than the average market prices of our common shares; however, these were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as inclusion would be antidilutive as a result of our loss during the period.  


  Dividends   

 We paid cash dividends to shareholders of $0.44 and $0.40 per share during the quarters ended December 28, 2018 and December 29, 2017, respectively.  

 Upon shareholders' approval of a dividend payment, we record a liability with a corresponding charge to shareholders' equity. At December 28, 2018 and September 28, 2018, the unpaid portion of the dividends recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $149 million and $303 million, respectively.

     ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading "Forward-Looking Information" and "Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors."  

 Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").  

 The following discussion includes organic net sales growth which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure" for additional information regarding this measure.  

 Overview 

 TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity" or the "Company," which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") is a global technology and manufacturing leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. For more than 75 years, our connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, have enabled advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home.  


 Our net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased marginally relative to first quarter fiscal 2018 sales levels, with sales growth in the Industrial Solutions and Communications Solutions segments offset by declines in the Transportation Solutions segment. On an organic basis, our net sales increased 1.9% during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  


Transportation SolutionsOur net sales decreased 2.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 due primarily to sales declines in the automotive end market.   

Industrial SolutionsOur net sales increased 5.2% during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 primarily as a result of increased sales in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market.   

Communications SolutionsOur net sales increased 2.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 due primarily to sales increases in the data and devices end market.  

 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $328 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.   

  Outlook  

 In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect our net sales to be between $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion as compared to $3.6 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This decrease reflects sales declines in the Transportation Solutions and, to a lesser degree, the Communications Solutions segments relative to the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Additional information regarding expectations  


Table of Contents 



Industrial SolutionsWe expect our net sales growth in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market to be offset by declines in the industrial equipment end market, where weakness in factory automation and controls applications is expected to be partially offset by growth in medical applications.  

Communications SolutionsWe expect our net sales to decline in the appliances and the data and devices end markets primarily as a result of market weakness in the AsiaPacific region.   

We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.17 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $155 million and $0.05 per share, respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018.  


Transportation SolutionsWe expect our net sales to decrease in the automotive end market due primarily to market weakness in China and, to a lesser degree, the EMEA region. We expect global automotive production to decline 4-5% in fiscal 2019.  

Industrial SolutionsWe expect our net sales increase in the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end market to be offset by declines in the energy end market.  

Communications SolutionsWe expect our net sales to decline in the appliances and the data and devices end markets due primarily to market weakness in the AsiaPacific region.   

We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.94 to $5.14 per share in fiscal 2019. This outlook reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $375 million and $0.16 per share, respectively, in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.  

 The above outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.  

 We are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. We continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs. See further discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  

  Discontinued Operations  

 During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our Subsea Communications ("SubCom") business for net cash proceeds of $288 million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $96 million. The SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and was reported as such in all periods presented on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to

discontinued operations, the SubCom business was included in the Communications Solutions segment. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.  

 Results of Operations 

  Net Sales  





 Net sales increased slightly in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in net sales resulting from organic net sales growth of 1.9% and sales contributions from an acquisition of 0.6% was offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 2.2% due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies. Price erosion adversely affected organic net sales by $28 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  

 See further discussion of net sales below under "Segment Results."  

 Net Sales by Geographic Region. Our business operates in three geographic regionsEMEA, AsiaPacific and the Americasand our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period.  

 Approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  


Table of Contents 






  Cost of Sales and Gross Margin  



 Gross margin decreased $50 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to price erosion, the negative impact of foreign currency translation, and lower manufacturing productivity, partially offset by lower material costs. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 33.3% in the first quarter of 2019 from 34.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  

 Cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices which continue to fluctuate for many of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. We expect to purchase approximately 190 million pounds of copper, 145,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.7 million troy  


Table of Contents 



  Operating Expenses  



 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $12 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase resulted primarily from a gain on the sale of certain assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 11.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from 11.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  

 Restructuring and Other Charges, Net. We are committed to continuous productivity improvements and consistently evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth.  

 During fiscal 2019, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements impacting all segments. During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments.  

 In connection with these initiatives, we incurred net restructuring charges of $75 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, of which $67 million related to the fiscal 2019 restructuring program. Annualized cost savings related to fiscal 2019 actions commenced during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 are expected to be approximately $60 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2020. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Currently, we expect fiscal 2019 net restructuring charges to be at least at fiscal 2018 levels, and we expect total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $160 million. However, as a result of market conditions, we are considering restructuring options and may broaden the scope of our cost initiatives and accelerate cost reduction and footprint consolidation activities.  

 See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.

 Income Taxes. See Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of items impacting income tax expense for the first quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018.  

 Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our SubCom business for net cash proceeds of $288 million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $96 million. The transaction is subject to a final working capital adjustment. The net sales of the business were $41 million and $143 million in the first quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 represent one month of activity. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, net sales and operating income were negatively impacted by production delays on a program. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Excluding these items, operating income decreased slightly in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the payment of $250 million of 2.35% senior notes due in 2019. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions.  

  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

 In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased $45 million to $328 million from $283 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase resulted primarily from higher collections of accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax income levels.  


Table of Contents  

 The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the first quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018 was $75 million and $82 million, respectively.  

  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  

 Capital expenditures were $210 million and $237 million in the first quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect fiscal 2019 capital spending levels to be approximately 5-6% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.  

 During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we received net cash proceeds of $288 million related to the sale of our SubCom business. See additional information in Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  

  Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization  

 Total debt at December 28, 2018 and September 28, 2018 was $3,967 million and $4,000 million, respectively. See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.  

 During November 2018, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our 100%-owned subsidiary, issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due June 2020. The notes bear interest at a rate of three-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.45% per year. The notes are TEGSA's unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.  

 During December 2018, TEGSA repaid, at maturity, $325 million 2.375% senior notes due 2018.  

 TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with total commitments of $1,500 million. The Credit Facility was amended in November 2018 primarily to extend the maturity date from December 2020 to November 2023. The amended Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to $500 million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 28, 2018 or September 28, 2018.  

 The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of December 28, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.  

 In addition to the Credit Facility, TEGSA is the borrower under our senior notes and commercial paper. TEGSA's payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.  

 Payments of common share dividends to shareholders were $150 million and $141 million in the first quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.  

 During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, our board of directors authorized an increase of $1.5 billion in the share repurchase program. We repurchased approximately 6 million of our common shares for $495 million and approximately 2 million of our common shares for $214 million under our share

repurchase program during the first quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. At December 28, 2018, we had $2.0 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.  

 Commitments and Contingencies 

  Legal Proceedings  

 In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  

  Guarantees  

 In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2019 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  


 At December 28, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $286 million.  

 As discussed above, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our SubCom business. In connection with the sale, we contractually agreed to continue to honor performance guarantees and letters of credit related to the SubCom business' projects that existed as of the date of sale. These guarantees have a combined value of approximately $1.7 billion and are expected to expire at various dates through fiscal 2025; however, the majority are expected to expire within two years. Also, under the terms of the definitive agreement, we are required to issue up to $300 million of new performance guarantees, subject to certain limitations, for projects entered into by the SubCom business following the sale for a period of up to three years. During the quarter ended December 28, 2018, we issued a guarantee of $70 million for a new project. We have contractual recourse against the SubCom business if we are required to perform on any SubCom guarantees; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the SubCom business.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

 The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses.  

 Our accounting policies for revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and pension liabilities are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management. For additional information regarding these policies and the underlying accounting assumptions and estimates used in these policies, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018. Except as set forth below, there were no significant changes to this information during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  

  Revenue Recognition  

 We adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our revenue recognition policy and the adoption of ASC 606.  

 Accounting Pronouncements 

 See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently adopted accounting pronouncements.  

 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

  Organic Net Sales Growth  

 We present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.  

 Organic net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance. Also, management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The tables presented in "Results of Operations" and "Segment Results" provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with GAAP.  

 Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.
