Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 


1. Description of Business and Basis of Consolidation and Presentation 

Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (PC), and mobile devices. We also operate esports events and leagues and create film and television content based on our intellectual property. The terms Activision Blizzard, the Company, we, us, and our are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. In connection with the 2008 business combination by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A. (Vivendi), and Vivendi Games, Inc., then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi, we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc. 

The common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol ATVI. 

Our Segments 

As part of the continued implementation of our esports strategy, we instituted changes to our internal organization and reporting structure during 2017 such that the Major League Gaming (MLG) business operates as a division of Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. (Blizzard). Commencing with the second quarter of 2017, MLG, which was previously a separate operating segment, became a component of the Blizzard operating segment. MLG is responsible for the operations of the Overwatch League, along with other esports events, and will also continue to serve as a multi-platform network for other Activision Blizzard esports content. 



Activision Publishing, Inc. (Activision) is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the console platform. Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products based on our internally developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties. We have also established a long-term alliance with Bungie to publish its game universe, Destiny. 



Blizzard is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the PC platform. Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net®, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content, along with Activisions Destiny 2 PC content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content. As noted above, Blizzard also includes the activities of our MLG business, which is responsible for the operations of the Overwatch League, along with other esports events, and will also continue to serve as a multi-platform network for other Activision Blizzard esports content. 


Table of Contents 



King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly on mobile platforms, such as Google Inc.s (Google) Android and Apple Inc.s (Apple) iOS. King also distributes its content and services on the PC platform, primarily via Facebook. Kings games are free to play, however, players can acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency the players purchase or directly using real currency. 


Other 


· the Activision Blizzard Studios (Studios) business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of globally recognized intellectual properties, and which, in October 2017, released the second season of the animated TV series Skylanders Academy on Netflix; and 

· the Activision Blizzard Distribution (Distribution) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware. 

Basis of Consolidation and Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for interim reporting. Accordingly, certain notes or other information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted if they substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in our annual audited consolidated financial statements. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for the fair statement of our financial position and results of operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. 


Table of Contents 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current period presentation. 

The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued, to provide additional evidence relative to certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosures. 

Supplemental Cash Flow Information 


· dividends payable of $259 million and $226 million, respectively; and 

· accrued withholding tax payments related to net share settlements on restricted stock units of $26 million and $17 million, respectively. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows include restricted cash of $7 million and $6 million, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, our beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows include restricted cash of $17 million and $13 million, respectively. 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

During the three months ended March 31, 2018, there were no significant changes to our accounting policies, except for our adoption of a new revenue accounting standard as discussed below. Refer to Note 2 contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a summary of our other significant accounting policies. 


In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard replaces all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminates all industry-specific guidance, providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments (the new revenue accounting standard). As a result, we have updated our significant accounting policy disclosure for revenue recognition herein. Refer to Note 3 for the impact of adoption on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition 


· full games, which typically provide access to main game content, primarily for console or PC; 

· downloadable content, which provides players with additional in-game content to purchase following the purchase of a full game; 


Table of Contents 

· microtransactions, which typically provide relatively small pieces of additional in-game content or enhancements to gameplay; and 

· subscriptions to players in our World of Warcraft franchise, which provide continual access to the game content. 

When control of the promised products and services is transferred to our customers, we recognize revenue in the amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for these products and services. 


· identifying the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 

· identifying the performance obligations in the contract; 

· determining the transaction price; 

· allocating the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and 

· recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services. 

Certain products are sold to customers with a street date (which is the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we recognize revenues on the later of the street date and the date the product is sold to our customer. For digital full-game downloads sold to customers, we recognize revenue when it is available for download or is activated for gameplay. Revenues are recorded net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed at the time of the specific revenue-producing transaction between us and our customer, such as sales and value-added taxes. 

Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment immediately upon purchase or within 30 to 90 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when we expect, at contract inception, that the period between our transfer of a promised product or service to our customer and payment for that product or service will be one year or less. 

Product Sales 

Product sales consist of sales of our games, including physical products and digital full-game downloads. We recognize revenues from the sale of our products after both (1) control of the products have been transferred to our customers and (2) underlying performance obligations have been satisfied. 

Revenues from product sales are recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and price protection are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. 

Sales incentives and other consideration given by us to our customers, such as rebates and product placement fees, are considered adjustments of the transaction price of our products and are reflected as reductions to revenues. Sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for distinct goods or services received, such as the appearance of our products in a customers national circular ad, are recorded as Sales and marketing expense when the benefit from the sales incentive is separable from sales to the same customer and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service. 


Table of Contents 

Products with Online Functionality 

For our software products that include both offline functionality (i.e., do not require an Internet connection to access) and significant online functionality, such as titles for the Call of Duty franchise, we evaluate whether the license of our intellectual property and the online functionality are distinct and separable. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on, including downloadable content. If we determine that our software products contain a license of intellectual property separate from the online functionality, we consider market conditions and other observable inputs to estimate the transaction price for the license, since we do not generally sell the software license on a standalone basis. These arrangements may be sold in a bundle with other products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations. 

We recognize revenue for arrangements that include both a license of intellectual property and separate online functionality when control of the license transfers to our customers for the portion of the transaction price allocable to the license and ratably over the estimated service period for the portion of the transaction price allocable to the online functionality. Similarly, we defer a portion of the cost of revenues on these arrangements and recognize the costs as the related revenues are recognized. The cost of revenues that are deferred include product costs, distribution costs, and software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses, and excludes intangible asset amortization. 

Online Hosted Software Arrangements 

For our online hosted software arrangements, such as titles for the Destiny, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush franchises, substantially all gameplay and functionality are obtained through our continuous hosting of the game content for the player. Similar to our software products with online functionality, these arrangements may include other products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations. Revenues related to online hosted software arrangements are generally recognized ratably over the estimated service period. 

Subscription Arrangements 

Subscription revenue arrangements are mostly derived from World of Warcraft, which is playable through Blizzards servers and is generally sold on a subscription-only basis. For World of Warcraft, after the first month of free usage that is included with the initial purchase of World of Warcraft software, the World of Warcraft end user may enter into a subscription agreement for additional future access. Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions via initial software purchases and standalone subscriptions sales are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then recognized ratably over the subscription period as the performance obligations are satisfied. 

Revenues attributable to the initial purchase of World of Warcraft software by our customers and related sales of expansion packs are classified as Product sales, whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and other in-game revenues are classified as Subscription, licensing, and other revenues. 

Licensing Revenues 



Table of Contents 

Other Revenues 

Other revenues primarily include revenues from downloadable content (e.g., multi-player content packs), microtransactions, and licensing of intellectual property other than software to third-parties. 

Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale of virtual currencies and goods to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from these sales of virtual currencies and goods are initially recorded in deferred revenue. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods purchased with a virtual currency. Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods directly are similarly recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods. We categorize our virtual goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed and our performance obligation is satisfied. Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the player and our performance obligation is satisfied, which is generally the estimated service period. 

Revenues from the licensing of intellectual property other than software to third parties primarily include the licensing of our (1) brand, logo, or franchise to customers and (2) media content. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our brand or franchise are generally recognized over the license term. Fixed fee payments from customers for the license of our media content are generally recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which may be upfront or over time. 

Significant Judgment around Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables 

Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Certain of our games, such as titles in the Call of Duty franchise, may contain a license of our intellectual property to play the game offline, but also depend on a significant level of integration and interdependency with the online functionality. In these cases, significant judgment is required to determine whether this license of our intellectual property should be considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the online functionality provided and recognized over time. Generally, for titles in which the software license is functional without the online functionality and a significant component of gameplay is available offline, we believe we have separate performance obligations for the license of the intellectual property and the online functionality. 

Significant judgment is also required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation and to determine whether there is a discount that needs to be allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of the various products and services. To estimate the standalone selling price we consider market data, including our pricing strategies for the product being evaluated and other similar products we may offer, competitor pricing to the extent data is available, and costs to determine whether the estimated selling price yields an appropriate profit margin. 

Estimated Service Period 

We consider a variety of data points when determining the estimated service period for players of our games, including the weighted average number of days between players first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average number of days between players first purchase date and last date played online. We also consider known online trends, the service periods of our previously released games, and, to the extent publicly available, the service periods of our competitors games that are similar in nature to ours. We believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of services to our customers, as it is the best representation of the time period during which our customers play our games. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires managements judgment. Future usage patterns may differ from historical usage patterns, and therefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service periods for players of our current games are generally less than 12 months. 


Table of Contents 

Principal Agent Considerations 


· which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service; and 

· which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. 

Based on our evaluation of the above indicators, we report revenues on a gross basis for sales arrangements via Apple App Store and Google Play Store, and we report revenues on a net basis (i.e. net of fees retained by the digital storefront) for sales arrangements via Microsofts Xbox Games Store and Sonys PSN. 

Contract Balances 

We generally record a receivable related to revenue when we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment, and record deferred revenue when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, even if amounts are refundable. 

The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our accounts receivable balance. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, we analyze the age of current outstanding account balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes in our customers payment terms and their economic condition, as well as whether we can obtain sufficient credit insurance. Any significant changes in any of these criteria would affect managements estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts. 


Refer to Note 9 - Deferred revenue for further information, including changes in deferred revenue during the period. 

Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer 

We apply the practical expedient to expense, as incurred, costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less for certain similar contracts in which commissions are paid to internal personnel or third parties. We believe application of the practical expedient has a limited effect on the amount or timing of cost recognition. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial as of March 31, 2018. 

Allowances for Returns and Price Protection 

We closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other publishers, market conditions, and the anticipated timing of other releases to assess future demand of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent reorders are evaluated with the goal of ensuring that quantities are sufficient to meet the demand from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel. We benchmark units to be shipped to our customers using historical and industry data.

Shipping and Handling 

Shipping and handling costs consist primarily of packaging and transportation charges incurred to move finished goods to customers. We recognize all shipping and handling costs as an expense in Cost of revenues-product costs, including those incurred when control of the product has already transferred to the customer. 

3. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

Revenue Recognition 



Table of Contents 



· The accounting for our sales of our games with significant online functionality for which we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided. Under the prior accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements was required. This requirement was eliminated under the new revenue accounting standard. Accordingly, we are required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of this software, as compared to recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated service period as previously required. This difference in accounting primarily impacted revenues from our Call of Duty franchise, where approximately 20% of the sales price is now recognized as revenue upon delivery of the games to our customers. Many of our other franchises, such as Destiny, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, are online hosted arrangements, and the accounting for our sales of these games under the new standard is relatively unchanged; and 

· The accounting for certain of our software licensing arrangements. While the impacts of the new revenue accounting standard may differ on a contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms), the new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements.

Adoption of the new revenue accounting standard had no impact to net cash from or used in operating, investing, or financing activities in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 

Financial Instruments 

In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The new standard, among other things, generally requires companies to measure investments in other entities, except those accounted for under the equity method, at fair value and to recognize any changes in fair value in net income. The new standard also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and the guidance should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The guidance related to equity investments without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) is applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and it did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Statement of Cash Flows-Restricted Cash 

In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. 

We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented. The application of this new standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. 

In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018, there will be a significant impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the acquisition of King, and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 to complete the acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance will be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, will not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows. 


Table of Contents 

Derivatives and Hedging 

In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for derivatives and hedging. The new guidance expands and refines hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedged items in the financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of a hedges effectiveness. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the standard during the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

Leases 

In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for its leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, with certain transition practical expedients available to provide relief in adopting the new standard. We are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements, but expect it to have a material impact to our consolidated balance sheet as a result of establishing lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for our operating leases. We do not plan to early adopt this new standard but do expect to elect and apply the available transition practical expedients upon adoption. 

Goodwill 

In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance which eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if an entity forgoes a Step 0 test, an entity will be required to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit, as determined in Step 1 from the goodwill impairment test, with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge, if any, for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The effect of adoption should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

· Level 1Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 


Table of Contents 

· Level 2Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data; and 

· Level 3Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. 

Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Hedges (Cash Flow Hedges) 



At March 31, 2018, our Cash Flow Hedges have remaining maturities of 12 months or less. Additionally, approximately $5 million of net realized but unrecognized losses are recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at March 31, 2018 for Cash Flow Hedges that had settled but were deferred and will be amortized into earnings, along with the associated hedged revenues. Such amounts will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. 



Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges 



For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, pre-tax net gains associated with these forward contracts were recorded in General and administrative expenses and were not material. 

Fair Value Measurements on a Non-Recurring Basis 

We measure the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis, generally annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no impairment charges related to assets that are measured on a non-recurring basis.

We record deferred revenue when cash payments are received or due in advance of the fulfillment of our associated performance obligations. The opening balance and ending balance of deferred revenues as of January 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018 was $1.8 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, including our current and non-current balances. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the additions to our deferred revenue balance were primarily due to cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, while the reductions to our deferred revenue balance were primarily due to the recognition of revenues upon fulfillment of our performance obligations, both of which were in the ordinary course of business. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, $1.1 billion of revenues were recognized that were included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period. 

As of March 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of contracted revenues allocated to our unsatisfied performance obligations is $1.7 billion, which includes our deferred revenues balances and amounts to be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. We expect to recognize a significant majority of this balance as revenue over the next 12 months, and the remainder thereafter. This balance does not include an estimate for variable consideration arising from sales-based royalty license revenue in excess of the contractual minimum guarantee. 


Credit Facilities 

At December 31, 2017, we had outstanding term loans A of approximately $990 million (the 2017 TLA) and $250 million available under a revolving credit facility (the Revolver) pursuant to a credit agreement executed on October 11, 2013 (as amended thereafter and from time to time, the Credit Agreement). To date, we have not drawn on the Revolver and at March 31, 2018, the 2017 TLA bore interest at 3.00% and had an outstanding balance of $990 million. We were in compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement as of March 31, 2018. 

Refer to Note 11 contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for further details regarding the Credit Agreement, key terms, and amendments made to the Credit Agreement. 

Unsecured Senior Notes 


· $750 million of 6.125% unsecured senior notes due September 2023 that we issued on September 19, 2013 (the 2023 Notes), in a private offering made in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act); 

· $650 million of 2.3% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the 2021 Notes) and $850 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes due September 2026 (the 2026 Notes) that we initially issued on September 19, 2016, in a private offering made in accordance with Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act, and subsequently exchanged for publicly registered notes in June 2017; and 

· $400 million of 2.6% unsecured senior notes due June 2022 (the 2022 Notes), $400 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes due June 2027 (the 2027 Notes), and $400 million of 4.5% unsecured senior notes due June 2047 (the 2047 Notes, and together with the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the 2023 Notes, the 2026 Notes, and the 2027 Notes, the Notes), that we issued on May 26, 2017, in a public underwritten offering. 

The Notes are general senior obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment to all of the Companys existing and future senior indebtedness, including the 2017 TLA and Revolver described above. The Notes are not secured and are effectively subordinated to any of the Companys existing and future indebtedness that is secured. We were in compliance with the terms of the Notes as of March 31, 2018.

Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year for the 2021 Notes, the 2023 Notes, and 2026 Notes, and payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year for the 2022 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and 2047 Notes. Accrued interest payable is recorded within Accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had accrued interest payable of $16 million and $28 million, respectively, related to the Notes. 

Refer to Note 11 contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for further details regarding our key terms under our indentures that govern the Notes. 

Interest Expense and Financing Costs 

Fees and discounts associated with the issuance of our debt instruments are recorded as debt discount, which reduces their respective carrying values, and are amortized over their respective terms. Amortization expense is recorded within Interest and other expense (income), net in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, interest expense was $40 million and $35 million, respectively; amortization of the debt discount and deferred financing costs was $2 million and $7 million, respectively; and commitment fees for the Revolver were not material.

On February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized repayments of up to $1.8 billion of the companys outstanding debt during 2018. The determination as to if and when we make any such repayment will be dependent on market conditions and other factors. 

Using Level 2 inputs (i.e., observable market prices in less-than-active markets) at March 31, 2018, with the exception of the 2023 Notes, the carrying values of our debt instruments approximated their fair values, as the interest rates were similar to current rates at which we could borrow funds over the selected interest periods. At March 31, 2018, based on Level 2 inputs, the fair value of the 2023 Notes was $785 million. 

Using Level 2 inputs at December 31, 2017, with the exception of the 2023 Notes and the 2047 Notes, the carrying values of our debt instruments approximated their fair values. At December 31, 2017, based on Level 2 inputs, the fair values of the 2023 Notes and the 2047 Notes were $795 million and $421 million, respectively. 

11. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 





Table of Contents 

Income taxes were not provided for foreign currency translation items, as these are considered indefinite investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the U.S. Tax Reform Act), we are re-evaluating our indefinite reinvestment assertions, but we have not yet completed this evaluation. In accordance with SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), we intend to complete this evaluation during the measurement period, which can be up to one year, and will record adjustments, if any, during this measurement period. 

12. Operating Segments and Geographic Region 


Our operating segments are also consistent with our internal organization structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the availability of separate financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments. As discussed in Note 1, commencing with the second quarter of 2017, we made changes to our operating segments which reflect the changes in our organization and reporting structure. Our MLG business, which was previously included in the non-reportable Other segments, is now presented within the Blizzard reportable operating segment. Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect this change. The change had no impact on consolidated net revenues or operating income.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposes a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. 

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118, which provides guidance on how to account for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act under ASC 740. SAB 118 enables companies to record a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year, until accounting is complete. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional amounts for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act in accordance with SAB 118. We continue to analyze the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Accounting for the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act requires complex new calculations to be performed and significant judgments in interpreting the legislation. Additional guidance may be issued on how the provisions of the U.S. Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. We may make adjustments to the provisional amounts as we collect and prepare the data necessary to finalize our calculations, interpret the U.S. Tax Reform Act and any additional guidance issued, and consider the effects of any additional actions we may take as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, there were no changes made to the provisional amounts that were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. 

Additionally, we continue to evaluate the ongoing impacts of the U.S. Tax Reform Act, including provisions impacting certain foreign income, such as a tax on global intangible low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries (GILTI) and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (FDII). These provisions are complex and subject to continuing regulatory interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). While we have included an estimate of GILTI and FDII in our estimated effective tax rate for 2018, we may make adjustments as we interpret the U.S. Tax Reform Act and any additional guidance issued, and consider the effects of any additional actions we may take as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform Act.

The income tax expense of $67 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, reflects an effective tax rate of 12%, which is higher than the effective tax rate of 6% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase is due to a lower excess tax benefit from share-based payments, partially offset by the impact of new provisions in the U.S. Tax Reform Act, including the reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate and the impact of FDII net of GILTI. 

The effective tax rate of 12% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower statutory rates, the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payments, and the recognition of federal and California research and development credits. 

Activision Blizzards tax years 2009 through 2016 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject. The IRS is currently examining the Companys federal tax returns for the 2009 through 2011 tax years, and during February 2018, the Company was notified that our tax returns for 2012 through 2016 tax years will also be subject to examination. The Company also has several state and non-U.S. audits pending, including the French audit discussed below. In addition, as part of purchase price accounting for the acquisition of King, the Company assumed $74 million of uncertain tax positions primarily related to the transfer pricing on King tax years occurring prior to the acquisition of King. The Company is currently in negotiations with the relevant jurisdictions and taxing authorities with respect to Kings transfer pricing, which could result in a different allocation of profits and losses between the relevant jurisdictions. 


In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are under examination or investigation, or may be subject to examination or investigation, by tax authorities in various jurisdictions. These proceedings may lead to adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or provisions for uncertain tax positions. Such proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations in the period or periods in which the matters are resolved or in which appropriate tax provisions are taken into account in our financial statements. If we were to receive a materially adverse assessment from a taxing jurisdiction, we would plan to vigorously contest it and consider all of our options, including the pursuit of judicial remedies. 

We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities in determining the appropriateness of our tax provisions. The final resolution of the Companys global tax disputes is uncertain. There is significant judgment required in the analysis of disputes, including the probability determination and estimation of the potential exposure. Based on current information, in the opinion of the Companys management, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations, except as noted above.

The vesting of certain of our employee-related restricted stock units and options is contingent upon the satisfaction of pre-defined performance measures. The shares underlying these equity awards are included in the weighted-average dilutive common shares only if the performance measures are met as of the end of the reporting period. Approximately 6 million and 9 million shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as their respective performance measures had not yet been met. 

Potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per common share calculation when the inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, approximately 2 million and 5 million options to acquire shares of common stock were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively, as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. 


Repurchase Program 

On February 2, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock during the two-year period from February 13, 2017 through February 12, 2019. As of March 31, 2018, we have not repurchased any shares under this program. 

Dividends 

On February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.34 per common share. Such dividend is payable on May 9, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2018. We have recorded $259 million of dividends payable in Accrued expenses and other liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2018. 

On February 2, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share. On May 10, 2017, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $226 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2017. On May 26, 2017, we made related dividend equivalent payments of less than $1 million to certain holders of restricted stock units.

Legal Proceedings 

We are party to routine claims, suits, investigations, audits, and other proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business, including with respect to intellectual property rights, contractual claims, labor and employment matters, regulatory matters, tax matters, unclaimed property matters, compliance matters, and collection matters. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, such routine claims and lawsuits are not significant and we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 

Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Business Overview 

Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (PC), and mobile devices. We also operate esports events and leagues and create film and television content based on our intellectual property. The terms Activision Blizzard, the Company, we, us, and our are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. In connection with the 2008 business combination (the Business Combination) by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A. (Vivendi), and Vivendi Games, Inc. (Vivendi Games), then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi, we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc. 

The common stock of Activision Blizzard is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol ATVI. 

Our Segments 

As part of the continued implementation of our esports strategy, we instituted changes to our internal organization and reporting structure during 2017 such that the Major League Gaming (MLG) business operates as a division of Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. (Blizzard). Commencing with the second quarter of 2017, MLG, which was previously a separate operating segment, became a component of the Blizzard operating segment. MLG is responsible for the operations of the Overwatch League, along with other esports events, and will also continue to serve as a multi-platform network for other Activision Blizzard esports content. 



Activision Publishing, Inc. (Activision), is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the console platform. Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products based on our internally developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties. We have also established a long-term alliance with Bungie to publish its game universe, Destiny.

Blizzard is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the PC platform. Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net®, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content, along with Activisions Destiny 2 PC content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content. As noted above, Blizzard also includes the activities of our MLG business, which is responsible for the operations of the Overwatch League, along with other esports events, and will also continue to serve as a multi-platform network for other Activision Blizzard esports content. 



King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly on mobile platforms, such as Google Inc.s (Google) Android and Apple Inc.s (Apple) iOS. King also distributes its content and services on the PC platform, primarily via Facebook. Kings games are free to play, however, players can acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency the players purchase or directly using real currency. 


Other 


· the Activision Blizzard Studios (Studios) business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our library of globally recognized intellectual properties, and which, in October 2017, released the second season of the animated TV series Skylanders Academy on Netflix; and 

· the Activision Blizzard Distribution (Distribution) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware. 

Business Results and Highlights 

Financial Results 

The Companys financial results for 2018 are presented in accordance with a new revenue accounting standard that was adopted in the first quarter of 2018. Prior period results have not been restated to reflect this change in accounting standards. Further information about our adoption of the new standard is provided in Notes 2 and 3 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 


· consolidated net revenues increased 14% to $1.97 billion, while consolidated operating income increased 21% to $595 million, as compared to consolidated net revenues of $1.73 billion and consolidated operating income of $493 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017; 

· revenues from digital online channels were $1.46 billion, or 74% of consolidated net revenues, as compared to $1.39 billion, or 80% of consolidated net revenues, for the three months ended March 31, 2017; 


Table of Contents 

· operating margin was 30.3%, as compared with 28.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2017; 

· cash flows from operating activities were $529 million, an increase of 29%, as compared to $411 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017; 

· consolidated net income increased 17% to $500 million, as compared to $426 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017; and 

· diluted earnings per common share increased 16% to $0.65, as compared to $0.56 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. 

Since certain of our games are hosted online or include significant online functionality that represents a separate performance obligation, we defer the transaction price allocable to the online functionality from the sale of these games and recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less than a year. Net revenues and operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, include a net effect of $581 million and $373 million, respectively, from the recognition of deferred net revenues and related cost of revenues. 

Content Release and Event Highlights 


Operating Metrics 

The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. 

Net Bookings 





· higher net bookings from the Candy Crush franchise due to increased monetization, primarily through in-game events and features; and 


The increase was partially offset by lower net bookings from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016. 


Table of Contents 

Monthly Active Users 

We monitor monthly active users (MAUs) as a key measure of the overall size of our user base. MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period. An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user. 



Average MAUs decreased by 11 million, or 3%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to minor decreases across franchises and less engaged users leaving the network. The decrease in Activisions average MAUs is due primarily to lower MAUs for Destiny 2. 

Average MAUs decreased by 57 million, or 13%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to decreases across Kings franchises that are largely attributable to the maturity of Kings titles and less engaged users leaving the network. 

Managements Overview of Business Trends 

Interactive Entertainment and Mobile Gaming Growth 

Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry. Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry has grown, on average, 18% over the last three years. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more common place across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment. 

Further, the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable market for gaming significantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is estimated to be larger than console and PC gaming and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from, our franchises. 


Table of Contents 

Opportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games 

Our fans spend significant time investing in our franchises through purchases of our game content, whether through purchases of full games or downloadable content or via microtransactions. Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emerging opportunities to drive additional engagement and investment in our franchises outside of games. These opportunities include esports, film and television, and consumer products. Our efforts to build these adjacent opportunities are still relatively nascent, but we view them as potentially significant sources of future revenues. 

As part of our efforts to take advantage of the esports opportunity, during 2017 we completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, and the inaugural season is underway. 

Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises 

The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry. According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 36% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2017. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games were responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch franchises, collectively, accounted for 66% of our consolidated net revenuesand a significantly higher percentage of our operating incomefor 2017. 

The top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. The top 10 console franchises in 2017 were all established franchises. Similarly, according to U.S. rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play store per App Annie Intelligence, as of December 2017, the top 10 mobile games have an average tenure of 22 months. 

In addition to investing in, and developing sequels and content for, our top franchises, we are continually exploring additional ways to expand those franchises. Further, while there is no guarantee of success, we invest in new properties in an effort to develop future top franchises. In 2014, we released Hearthstone and Destiny, in 2015, we released Heroes of the Storm, and in 2016, we released Overwatch. Additionally, to diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase our presence in the mobile market, on February 23, 2016, we completed the acquisition of King. 

Overall, we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our, and the industrys, revenues and profits in the near future. Accordingly, our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against our competitors top franchises can significantly impact our performance. 

Recurring Revenue Business Models 

Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more consistently recurring and year-round model. Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year. This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal.

Consolidated Net Revenues

· higher revenues from King of $68 million, primarily driven by the Candy Crush franchises increased monetization, primarily through in-game events and features. 


Change in Deferred Revenues Recognized 

The increase in net deferred revenues recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to higher net deferred revenues recognized for Activision of $193 million, primarily due to higher net deferred revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise, driven by the release of Destiny 2 in September 2017, with no comparable release in 2016. 


Foreign Exchange Impact 

Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $110 million on Activision Blizzards consolidated net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound. 

Operating Segment Results 


Our operating segments are also consistent with our internal organization structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the availability of separate financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments. As discussed in the Business Overview above, commencing with the second quarter of 2017, we made changes to our operating segments which reflect the changes in our organization and reporting structure. Our MLG business, which was previously included in the non-reportable Other segments, is now presented within the Blizzard reportable segment. Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect this change. This change had no impact on consolidated net revenues or operating income.

· lower revenues from the Skylanders franchise, as the last title release was in 2016. 

Blizzard 



· revenues from the Overwatch League, which started its inaugural regular season in January 2018. 

The increase was partially offset by lower revenues from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016. 

King 

The increase in Kings net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchises increased monetization, primarily through in-game events and features. 

Segment Income from Operations 

Activision 

The increase in Activisions operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to the higher revenues, as discussed above, and lower product costs from lower sales of our previously released titles for the Skylanders and Guitar Hero franchises, which typically had higher product costs per unit due to the included physical items (i.e. toys and guitars). This was partially offset by higher personnel and external developer costs to support existing and upcoming title releases. 


Table of Contents 

Blizzard 

The decrease in Blizzards operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to costs incurred to operate and market new business initiatives and higher personnel costs to support Blizzards overall business. This was partially offset by higher capitalization of software development costs due to the timing of the game development cycle. 

King 

The increase in Kings operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to the higher revenues, as discussed above. The increase was partially offset by higher software development costs. 

Foreign Exchange Impact 

Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $72 million on reportable segment net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in the previous year. The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.

Costs and Expenses 

Cost of Revenues 




The increase in product costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to higher product costs of $18 million driven by the increase in product sales associated with the Call of Duty and Destiny franchises, partially offset by lower product costs from lower sales of our previously-released titles for the Skylanders and Guitar Hero franchises, which typically had higher product costs per unit due to the included physical items (i.e. toys and guitars). 




· higher digital storefront fees (e.g. fees retained by Apple and Google for our sales on their platforms) of $20 million, primarily associated with the increase in our mobile revenues; and 

· higher personnel, facilities, and equipment costs of $16 million associated with our online games and broadcasting operations. 

The decrease in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to subscription, licensing, and other revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to a decrease of $37 million in the amount of amortization associated with internally-developed franchise intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of King. 

Product Development (amounts in millions) 



Table of Contents 

The increase in product development costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to a $59 million increase in personnel and external developer costs to support existing and upcoming title releases. The increase was partially offset by higher capitalization of software development costs of $25 million due to the timing of the game development cycle. 

Sales and Marketing (amounts in millions) 


Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were comparable to the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to a $39 million increase in marketing spending and personnel costs, primarily associated with the Candy Crush franchise and the Overwatch League, which started its inaugural regular season in January 2018, partially offset by marketing for the Bubble Witch franchise, as Bubble Witch 3 Saga was released during the first quarter of 2017, with no comparable release in 2018. The increase was partially offset by a $33 million decrease in amortization associated with the customer base intangible asset acquired in the acquisition of King, as the asset was fully amortized during the period. 

General and Administrative (amounts in millions) 


The increase in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to a $33 million increase in personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, facilities costs, and professional fees, to support the growth of our business and adjacent areas of opportunity. The increase was partially offset by the inclusion of non-cash accounting charge of $16 million in 2017 to reclassify certain losses included in our cumulative translation adjustments into earnings due to the substantial liquidation of certain of our foreign entities, for which there was no comparable activity in 2018. 

Interest and Other Expense (Income), Net (amounts in millions) 


The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to higher interest income of $11 million from our cash and cash equivalents as compared to the prior period. 

Income Tax Expense (amounts in millions) 



Table of Contents 

The income tax expense of $67 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, reflects an effective tax rate of 12%, which is higher than the effective tax rate of 6% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase is due to a lower excess tax benefit from share-based payments, partially offset by the impact of new provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the U.S. Tax Reform Act), including the reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate and the impact of foreign derived intangible income (FDII) net of the tax on global intangible low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries (GILTI). 

The effective tax rate of 12% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21%, primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower statutory rates, the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based payments, and the recognition of federal and California research and development credits. 

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposes a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. 

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118, which provides guidance on how to account for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act under ASC 740. SAB 118 enables companies to record a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year, until accounting is complete. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional amounts for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act in accordance with SAB 118. Accounting for the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act requires complex new calculations to be performed and significant judgments in interpreting the legislation. Additional guidance may be issued on how the provisions of the U.S. Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. We may make adjustments to the provisional amounts as we collect and prepare the data necessary to finalize our calculations, interpret the U.S. Tax Reform Act and any additional guidance issued, and consider the effects of any additional actions we may take as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, there were no changes made to the provisional amounts that were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017. We will continue to analyze the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

We continue to evaluate the impact of the U.S. Tax Reform Act, including provisions impacting certain foreign income, such as GILTI and a deduction for FDII. These provisions are complex and subject to continuing regulatory interpretation by the IRS. While we have included an estimate of GILTI and FDII in our estimated effective tax rate for 2018, we may make adjustments as we interpret the U.S. Tax Reform Act and any additional guidance issued, and consider the effects of any additional actions we may take as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. 


Further information about our income taxes is provided in Note 13 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. In the near term, we expect our business and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5.3 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $250 million revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months. Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as our anticipated dividend payments, share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities. 


Table of Contents 

As of March 31, 2018, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $3.4 billion, as compared to $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2017. Following the enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform Act and the current period expense on unrepatriated earnings, we no longer consider these available cash balances, which primarily relate to undistributed earnings of our most significant foreign subsidiaries, to be indefinitely reinvested. 

Our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. We consider, on a continuing basis, various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, share repurchases, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments. 

Sources of Liquidity (amounts in millions) 



Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 


Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $529 million, as compared to $411 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher net income in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the first quarter of 2017, along with larger adjustments to net income for non-cash charges, primarily associated with deferred income taxes. The increase was partially offset by changes in our working capital due to the timing of collections and payments. 

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 

The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions. 


Table of Contents 


· purchases of available-for-sale investments of $20 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, with no comparable transaction in the prior period; and 

· capital expenditures of $31 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $21 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. 

Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities 

The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends. 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $8 million, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $404 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The change was primarily attributed to our debt financing activities in the prior year. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we had net debt repayments of $500 million, with no comparable repayment activity for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This impact was partially offset by lower proceeds from stock option exercises and higher tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units of $47 million and $39 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $109 million and $13 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. 

Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes 

Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $18 million and a positive impact of $19 million on our cash and cash equivalents for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound. 

Debt 

As of both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our total outstanding debt was $4.4 billion, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 3.64% and 3.58%, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, there was no activity associated with our debt instruments except for normal recurring interest payments. 

On February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized repayments of up to $1.8 billion of the companys outstanding debt during 2018. The determination as to if and when we make any such repayment will be dependent on market conditions and other factors.

Dividends 

On February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.34 per common share. Such dividend is payable on May 9, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2018. We have recorded $259 million of dividends payable in Accrued expenses and other liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2018. 

Capital Expenditures 

For the year ending December 31, 2018, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $140 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, capital expenditures were $31 million. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes, that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Below are recently issued accounting pronouncements that were most significant to our accounting policy activities. For a detailed discussion of all relevant recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 3 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

Revenue Recognition 

As discussed in Note 2 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition and on January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments (the new revenue accounting standard), utilizing the modified retrospective method. Additionally, we elected to apply the new revenue accounting standard only to contracts not completed as of the adoption date. For contracts that were modified before the period of adoption, we elected to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications when (i) identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, (ii) determining the transaction price, and (iii) allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue accounting standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The cumulative effect adjustment recorded to our retained earnings at January 1, 2018 was $88 million. 


Table of Contents 


· The accounting for our sales of our games with significant online functionality for which we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided. Under the prior accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements was required. This requirement was eliminated under the new revenue accounting standard. Accordingly, we are required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of this software, as compared to recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated service period, as previously required. This difference in accounting primarily impacted revenues from our Call of Duty franchise, where approximately 20% of the sales price is now recognized as revenue upon delivery of the games to our customers. Many of our other franchises, such as Destiny, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, are online hosted arrangements, and the accounting for our sales of these games under the new standard is relatively unchanged; and 

· The accounting for certain of our software licensing arrangements. While the impacts of the new revenue accounting standard may differ on a contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms), the new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements. 

For additional discussion regarding the impact of our adoption of the new revenue accounting standard, including the impacts to our condensed consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations, see Note 3 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Statement of Cash Flows-Restricted Cash 

In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. 

We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented. The application of this new standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. 

In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018, there will be a significant impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the acquisition of King, and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 to complete the acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance will be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, will not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows. 

Derivatives and Hedging 

In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for derivatives and hedging. The new guidance expands and refines hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedged items in the financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of a hedges effectiveness. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the standard during the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 


Table of Contents 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

Leases 

In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for its leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, with certain transition practical expedients available to provide relief in adopting the new standard. We are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements, but expect it to have a material impact to our consolidated balance sheet as a result of establishing lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for our operating leases. We do not plan to early adopt this new standard but do expect to elect and apply the available transition practical expedients upon adoption. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 

We transact business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Revenues and related expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in their respective local currencies. Primary currencies include Euros, British pounds, Australian dollars, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, and Swedish krona. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency-denominated transactions will result in reduced revenues, operating expenses, net income, and cash flows from our international operations. Similarly, our revenues, operating expenses, net income, and cash flows will increase for our international operations if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies. Since we have significant international sales, but incur the majority of our costs in the United States, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business. We monitor currency volatility throughout the year. 

To mitigate our foreign currency risk resulting from our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets, liabilities, and earnings and our foreign currency risk related to functional currency-equivalent cash flows resulting from our intercompany transactions, we periodically enter into currency derivative contracts, principally forward contracts. These forward contracts generally have a maturity of less than one year. The counterparties for our currency derivative contracts are large and reputable commercial or investment banks. 

The fair values of our foreign currency contracts are estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period. 

We do not hold or purchase any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. 


Table of Contents 

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Hedges (Cash Flow Hedges) 



At March 31, 2018, our Cash Flow Hedges have remaining maturities of 12 months or less. Additionally, approximately $5 million of net realized but unrecognized losses are recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at March 31, 2018 for Cash Flow Hedges that had settled but were deferred and will be amortized into earnings, along with the associated hedged revenues. Such amounts will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. 



Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges 



For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, pre-tax net gains associated with these forward contracts were recorded in General and administrative expenses and were not material. 

In the absence of hedging activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10% would have resulted in a theoretical decline of our net income of approximately $32 million. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; however, all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in this manner and actual results may differ materially. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate debt pursuant to the credit agreement we entered into on October 11, 2013, as amended thereafter and from time to time. We currently do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. As of both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, a hypothetical interest rate change on our variable rate debt of one percent (100 basis points) would have changed interest expense on an annual basis by approximately $10 million. This estimate does not include a change in interest income from our investment portfolio that may result from such a hypothetical interest rate change, nor does it include the effects of other actions that we may take in the future to mitigate this risk, or any changes in our financial structure. Refer to Note 10 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for disclosures regarding interest rates associated with our debt obligations. 


Table of Contents 

Our investment portfolio consists primarily of money market funds and government securities with high credit quality and short average maturities. Because short-term securities mature relatively quickly and must be reinvested at the then-current market rates, interest income on a portfolio consisting of cash, cash equivalents, or short-term securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer-term securities. Conversely, the fair value of such a portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer-term securities. At March 31, 2018, our $5.22 billion of cash and cash equivalents was comprised primarily of money market funds. 

The Company has determined that, based on the composition of our investment portfolio as of March 31, 2018, there was no material interest rate risk exposure to the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity as of that date. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Definition and Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 


Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures at March 31, 2018, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, at March 31, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, at March 31, 2018, there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During the first quarter of 2018, we implemented internal controls to ensure we adequately evaluated our contracts and properly assessed the impact of the new accounting standard related to revenue recognition on our financial statements to facilitate their adoption. There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting due to the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard.
