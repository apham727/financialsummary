 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements




The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and therefore do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP); however, such information reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.

The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, some of the Company’s statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q may involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected future results. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year.

Reclassification


Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance



The Company utilizes lease agreements to meet its operating needs. These leases support global staff via the use of office space, warehouses, vehicles for technicians and information technology (IT) equipment. The Company utilizes both operating and finance leases in its portfolio of leased assets, however, the majority of these leases are classified as operating. A significant portion of the volume of the lease portfolio is in fleet vehicles and IT office equipment, however, real estate leases constitute a majority of the value of the ROU assets. Lease agreements are utilized worldwide, with the largest location concentration in the United States, Germany and India.


•The Company elected the option to apply the transition requirements in ASC 842 at the effective date of January 1, 2019. The effects of initially applying ASC 842 resulted in no cumulative adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption. 

•The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed the Company to carry forward its ASC 840 assessment regarding definition of a lease, lease classification, and initial direct costs.

•The practical expedient related to land easements is not applicable as the Company currently does not utilize any easements.

•The Company declined the hindsight practical expedient to determine the lease term and ROU asset impairment for existing leases. The decision to decline the hindsight practical expedient resulted in relying on assessments made under ASC 840 during transition and re-assessing under ASC 842 going forward. 

•The Company declined the short-term lease exception, therefore recognizing all leases in the ROU asset and lease liability balances. Consistent with ASC 842 requirements, leases that are one month or less are not included in the balance.

•The Company elected to not separate non-lease components from lease components and, instead, to account for each separate lease component and the non-lease components associated with it as a single lease component, recognized on the balance sheet. This election has been made for all classes of underlying assets. 





The weighted-average discount rates used for operating and finance leases varies due to the jurisdictional composition, whereas the Company has an immaterial amount of finance leases that are primarily comprised of leases in Turkey which have higher interest rates.

Certain lease agreements include payments based on a variety of global indexes or rates. These payment amounts have been projected using the index or rate as of lease commencement or the transition date and measured in ROU assets and lease liabilities. Other leases contain variable payments that are based on actual usage of the underlying assets and therefore are not measured in assets or liabilities as the variable payments are not based on an index or a rate. For real estate leases, these payments are most often tied to non-committed maintenance or utilities charges, and for equipment leases, to actual output or hours in operation. These amounts typically become known when the invoice is received, which is when expense is recognized. In rare circumstances, our lease agreements may contain residual value guarantees. Our lease agreements do not contain any restrictions or covenants, such as those relating to dividends or incurring additional financial obligations. 

As of March 31, 2019, the Company did not have any leases that have not yet commenced but that create significant rights and obligations.

The Company determines whether an arrangement is or includes a lease at contract inception. All contracts containing the right to use an underlying asset are reviewed to confirm that the contract meets the definition of a lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date and initially measured based on the present value of lease payments over the defined lease term.

As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. In order to apply the incremental borrowing rate, a rate table was developed to assign the appropriate rate to each lease based on lease term and currency of payments. For leases with large numbers of underlying assets, a portfolio approach with a collateralized rate was utilized. Assets were grouped based on similar lease terms and economic environments in a manner whereby the Company reasonably expects that the application does not differ materially from a lease-by-lease approach.

Finance leases are included in other assets, other current liabilities and other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 


Basic earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding. Under the two-class method of computing earnings (loss) per share, non-vested share-based payment awards that contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends are considered participating securities. The Company’s participating securities include restricted stock units (RSUs), director deferred shares and shares that were vested but deferred by employees. The Company calculated basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share under both the treasury stock method and the two-class method. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no differences in the earnings (loss) per share amounts calculated under the two methods. Accordingly, the treasury stock method is disclosed below.

The Company’s share-based compensation payments to employees are recognized based on their grant-date fair values during the period in which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. Share-based compensation is primarily recognized as a component of selling and administrative expense. Total share-based compensation expense was $9.3 and $13.7 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In the first quarter of 2019, the Company changed its accounting estimate from using a forfeiture assumption to recording actual forfeitures. The change resulted in an immaterial increase in share-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2019.

Performance shares are granted to employees and vest based on the achievement of certain performance objectives, as determined by the board of directors each year. Each performance share earned entitles the holder to one common share of the Company. The Company's performance shares include performance objectives that are assessed after a three-year period as well as performance objectives that are assessed annually over a three-year period. No shares are vested unless certain performance threshold objectives are met.

As of March 31, 2019, there were 0.1 non-employee director deferred shares vested and outstanding.

On April 25, 2019, the Company's shareholders approved amendments to the 2017 Plan, which provide for an additional 3.0 common shares available for award. The 2017 Plan is expected to attract and retain directors, officers and employees of the Company by providing incentives and rewards for performance.


The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations was (85.0) percent for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The expense on the loss is due primarily to the tax impacts of the the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) on the estimated projected tax rate. More specifically, the impacts of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) and base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT). In addition, the Company collapsed its Barbados structure to meet the debt covenant requirements from our lenders during the quarter which resulted in additional discrete tax expense which is being offset in part by the valuation allowance release relating to the Company’s nondeductible interest expense resulting in no additional cash taxes. The above items noted as well as the Company’s jurisdictional income (loss) mix and varying respective statutory rates are the primary drivers of the quarterly tax rate.

The effective tax rate on the net loss was (40.4) percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The expense on the loss is due primarily from impacts related to GILTI on the estimated annual tax rate.

The increase in finished goods inventory was primarily attributable to increased in transit inventory to meet customer orders in Brazil, Thailand and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). 


The Company’s investments, primarily in Brazil, consist of certificates of deposit that are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). Realized gains and losses are recognized in investment income and are determined using the specific identification method. There were no realized gains from the sale of securities or proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.

The Company has deferred compensation plans that enable certain employees to defer receipt of a portion of their cash, 401(k) or share-based compensation and non-employee directors to defer receipt of director fees at the participants’ discretion. For deferred cash-based compensation, the Company established rabbi trusts (refer to note 18), which are recorded at fair value of the underlying securities within securities and other investments. The related deferred compensation liability is recorded at fair value within other long-term liabilities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities in the rabbi trusts are recognized in interest income. 



Securities and other investments also includes a cash surrender value of insurance contracts of $9.3 and $11.1 as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to death benefits paid. In addition, it includes an interest rate swap asset carrying value of $2.8 and $4.8 as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which also represents fair value (refer to note 18).

respectively, which are included in trade receivables, less allowances for doubtful accounts accounts payables on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

In May 2017, the Company announced a strategic partnership with Kony, a leading enterprise mobility and application company, to offer white label mobile application solutions for financial institutions and retailers. As of March 31, 2019, the Company's carrying value in Kony was $14.0 and the fair value was not estimated as there were no events or changes in circumstances in the investment.

There were no significant changes in provision for credit losses, recoveries and write-offs during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. As of March 31, 2019, finance leases and notes receivable individually evaluated for impairment were $36.6 and $4.8, respectively, with no provision recorded. As of March 31, 2018, finance leases and notes receivable individually evaluated for impairment were $32.4 and $15.0, respectively. There have been no material changes to the balances on the finance lease receivables maturity schedule since December 31, 2018. The income related to the finance lease receivables was minimal for the three months ended March 31, 2019. 

The Company records interest income and any fees or costs related to financing receivables using the effective interest method over the term of the lease or loan. The Company reviews the aging of its financing receivables to determine past due and delinquent accounts. Credit quality is reviewed at inception and is re-evaluated as needed based on customer-specific circumstances. Receivable balances 60 days to 89 days past due are reviewed and may be placed on nonaccrual status based on customer-specific circumstances. Receivable balances are placed on nonaccrual status upon reaching greater than 89 days past due. Upon receipt of payment on nonaccrual financing receivables, interest income is recognized and accrual of interest is resumed once the account has been made current or the specific circumstances have been resolved.

As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the recorded investment in past-due financing receivables was minimal and no recorded investment in the finance receivables was past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. 




During the second quarter of 2018, the Company performed an impairment test of goodwill for all of its line of business (LoB) reporting units due to the change in its reportable operating segments. Based on the results of the LoB testing, the fair values of 

DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

FORM 10-Q as of March 31, 2019

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)



each of the Company's reporting units exceed their carrying values except for the Services-Asia Pacific (AP) and Software-EMEA reporting units which resulted in a non-cash impairment loss of $83.1 during the second quarter 2018. 

The Company identified four reporting units, which are Eurasia Banking, Americas Banking, EMEA Retail and Rest of World Retail. Management determined that the Americas Banking and EMEA Retail reporting unit had a cushion of approximately 20 percent and 10 percent, respectively, when compared to their carrying amounts. The Eurasia Banking had minimal excess fair value or cushion when compared to their carrying amounts, but primarily due to the reporting unit's improved performance, it did not indicate any impairment during the qualitative annual goodwill impairment test. Rest of World Retail had no carrying value as of December 31, 2018. Changes in certain assumptions or the Company's failure to execute on the current plan could have a significant impact to the estimated fair value of the reporting units.

During the second and third quarters 2018, the Company estimated the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of the income valuation and market approach methodologies. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions, including significant unobservable inputs. The key inputs included, but were not limited to, discount rates, terminal growth rates, market multiple data from selected guideline public companies, management’s internal forecasts which include numerous assumptions such as projected net sales, gross profit, sales mix, operating and capital expenditures and earnings before interest and taxes margins, among others.

As a result of certain impairment triggering events, the Company performed an interim impairment test of goodwill for its four reporting units during the third quarter of 2018. Based on the results of the impairment testing, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $134.4 related to the Eurasia Banking, EMEA Retail and Rest of World Retail reporting units during the third quarter of 2018. 



Amortization expense on capitalized software of $8.6 and $8.8 was included in service and software cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company's total amortization expense, including deferred financing costs, was $37.1 and $39.9 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.


The Company provides its global operations guarantees and standby letters of credit through various financial institutions for suppliers, customers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers. If the Company is not able to make payments or fulfill contractual obligations, the suppliers, customers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers may draw on the pertinent bank. At March 31, 2019, the maximum future payment obligations related to these various guarantees totaled $220.3, of which $27.5 represented standby letters of credit to insurance providers, and no associated liability was recorded. At December 31, 2018, the maximum future payment obligations relative to these various guarantees totaled $135.2, of which $27.5 represented standby letters of credit to insurance providers, and no associated liability was recorded.

The Company provides its customers a manufacturer’s warranty and records, at the time of the sale, a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs. Estimated future obligations due to warranty claims are based upon historical factors such

as labor rates, average repair time, travel time, number of service calls per machine and cost of replacement parts. The decrease in the liability was primarily due to warranties expiring in Brazil and Germany.

The Company has a revolving and term loan credit agreement (the Credit Agreement), with a revolving facility of up to $500.0 (the Revolving Facility). On December 23, 2020, the Term Loan A Facility will mature and the Revolving Facility will automatically terminate. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding Revolving Facility borrowings as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was 6.00 percent and 5.97 percent, respectively, which is variable based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The amount available under the Revolving Facility as of March 31, 2019 was $337.5, after excluding $27.5 in letters of credit.

On May 9, 2017, the Company entered into an incremental amendment to its Credit Agreement (the Incremental Agreement) which reduced the initial term loan B facility (the Term Loan B Facility) of a $1,000.0 U.S. dollar-denominated tranche to $475.0. The reduction was funded using the $250.0 proceeds drawn from the Delayed Draw Term Loan A Facility, a replacement of $70.0 with Term Loan B Facility - Euro and previous principal payments.


On August 30, 2018, the Company entered into a sixth amendment and incremental amendment (the Sixth Amendment) to its Credit Agreement. The Amendment amended the financial covenants and established a new senior secured incremental term A-1 facility in an aggregate principal amount of $650.0 (Term Loan A-1 Facility) and makes certain other changes to the Credit Agreement. Following the execution of the Sixth Amendment, the Company has executed, and has caused certain of its subsidiaries to execute, certain foreign security and guaranty documents for the benefit of the secured parties under the Credit Agreement that provide for guarantees by, and additional security with respect to the equity interests in and the the stock of certain foreign subsidiaries.

A portion of the proceeds of the Term Loan A-1 Facility are restricted to fund the purchase of the remaining shares of Diebold Nixdorf AG not owned by the Company. The proceeds were used to make optional prepayments of existing term A loans in the amount of $130.0 and to permanently reduce revolving credit commitments in an amount of $20.0 and to make a purchase pursuant to an offer open to all term B lenders on a pro rata basis for $100.0 in face principal amount of term B loans. Any remaining proceeds were used for general corporate and working capital purposes.

The interest rate with respect to the Term Loan A-1 Facility is based on, at the Company’s option, either the alternative base rate (ABR) plus 8.25 percent or a eurocurrency rate plus 9.25 percent. The Term A-1 Facility will mature in August 2022, the fourth anniversary of the Sixth Amendment. The Term Loan A-1 Facility is subject to a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio, a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and certain covenant reset triggers (Covenant Reset Triggers) as described in the Sixth Amendment. Upon the occurrence of any Covenant Reset Trigger, the financial covenant levels will automatically revert to previous financial covenant levels in effect prior to the Sixth Amendment. 



The Company has $400.0 aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2024 (the 2024 Senior Notes), which are and will be guaranteed by certain of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries and mature in April 2024.





The debt facilities under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries that are borrowers or guarantors under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens.

The Company's financing agreements contain various financial covenants, including net debt to capitalization, net debt to EBITDA and net interest coverage ratio, along with certain negative covenants that, among other things, limit dividends, acquisitions and the use of proceeds from divestitures. Under the Sixth Amendment, the Term Loan A-1 Facility is under a covenant holiday period until the earlier of any covenant reset trigger or April 1, 2019.

Nixdorf, Incorporated, and Diebold Nixdorf AG, the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest related to the Diebold Nixdorf AG of $386.7 was reclassified to redeemable noncontrolling interest. For the period of time that the DPLTA is effective, this interest in Diebold Nixdorf AG will remain in redeemable noncontrolling interest and presented outside of equity in the consolidated balance sheets of the Company. As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the balance related to the redeemable noncontrolling interest related to the Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary shares the Company did not acquire was $87.4 and $99.1, respectively. The change is primarily related to currency fluctuations and the redemption of 0.2 Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary shares in the three months ended March 31, 2019. The Company increased its ownership stake in Diebold Nixdorf AG to 28.4 ordinary shares, or approximately 95.3 percent, as of March 31, 2019. In March 2019, at a Diebold Nixdorf AG shareholder meeting, a merger squeeze-out was approved and, as a result, Diebold Nixdorf AG and Diebold KGaA will continue to execute the squeeze-out procedures.

The DPLTA offers the Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders, at their election, (i) the ability to put their Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary shares to Diebold KGaA in exchange for cash compensation of €55.02 per Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary share or (ii) to remain Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders and receive a recurring compensation in cash of €2.82 per Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary share for each full fiscal year of Diebold Nixdorf AG. The redemption value adjustment includes the updated cash compensation pursuant to the DPLTA. A portion of the proceeds of the Term Loan A-1 Facility are restricted to fund the purchase of the remaining shares of Diebold Nixdorf AG not owned by the Company. The Company classified the proceeds set aside to purchase the remaining shares in restricted cash in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

The remaining balance relates to certain noncontrolling interests with redemption features, that include put rights that are not within the control of the issuer, which are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. The redeemable noncontrolling interests were recorded at fair value as by applying the income approach using unobservable inputs for projected cash flows, including but not limited, to net sales and operating profit, and a discount rate, which are considered Level 3 inputs. The results of operations for these redeemable noncontrolling interests were not significant. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the put rights are uncertain.

The Company has qualified retirement plans covering certain U.S. employees that have been closed to new participants since 2003 and frozen since December 2013. Plans that cover salaried employees provide retirement benefits based on an employee’s compensation during the ten years before the date of the plan freeze or the date of the employee's actual separation from service, if earlier. The Company’s funding policy for salaried plans is to contribute annually based on actuarial projections and applicable regulations. Plans covering hourly employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service. The Company’s funding policy for hourly plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by applicable regulations.

The Company has non-qualified pension plans to provide supplemental retirement benefits to certain officers, which have also been frozen since December 2013. Benefits are payable at retirement based upon a percentage of the participant’s compensation, as defined. In addition to providing retirement benefits, the Company provides post-employment healthcare and life insurance benefits (referred to as other benefits) for certain retired employees. Retired eligible employees in the United States may be entitled to these benefits based upon years of service with the Company, age at retirement and collective bargaining agreements. There are no plan assets and the Company funds the benefits as the claims are paid. The post-employment benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and life insurance plans together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates.

The Company also has defined benefit plans in Germany and Switzerland, among others. In Germany, post-employment benefit plans are set up as employer funded pension plans and deferred compensation plans. The employer funded pension commitments in Germany are based upon direct performance-related commitments in terms of defined contribution plans. Each beneficiary receives, depending on individual pay-scale grouping, contractual classification or income level, different yearly contributions. The contribution is multiplied by an age factor appropriate to the respective pension plan and credited to the individual retirement account of the employee. The retirement accounts may be used up at retirement by either a one-time lump-sum payout or payments of up to ten years. Insured events include disability, death and reaching of retirement age. In Switzerland, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The employees receive their pension payments as a function of contributions paid, a fixed interest rate and annuity factors. Insured events are disability, death and reaching of retirement age. 



Contributions

There have been no significant changes to the expected 2019 plan year contribution amounts previously disclosed. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, contributions of $11.9 and $22.6, respectively, were made to the qualified and non-qualified pension plans. The Company anticipates reimbursement of approximately $13 for certain benefits paid from its trustee in 2019. In March 2018, the Company received a $13.8 reimbursement for certain benefits paid from its trustees.

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business or financing activities. The Company’s derivative foreign currency instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and cash payments principally related to the Company’s non functional currency assets and liabilities. The Company's interest rate derivatives are used to manage the differences in amount due to variable rate interest rate borrowings.

Interest Rate

Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. The Company estimates that a minimal amount will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense over the next year.

In November 2016, the Company entered into multiple pay-fixed receive-variable interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $400.0. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.

The Company has an interest rate swap for a nominal sum of €50.0, which was entered into in May 2010 with a ten-year term from October 1, 2010 until September 30, 2020. The interest rate swap is not designated and changes in the fair value of non-

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)



designated interest rate swap agreements are recognized in miscellaneous, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized $0.5 in interest expense relating to the interest rate swap for both the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.

Additionally, the Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any additional derivatives that are not designated as hedges.


Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value



The Company uses the end of period when determining the timing of transfers between levels. During each of the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no transfers between levels. 



Refer to note 11 for further details surrounding the Company's long-term debt as of March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. Additionally, the Company remeasures certain assets to fair value, using Level 3 measurements, as a result of the occurrence of triggering events. In the second and third quarters of 2018, in connection with certain triggering events, the Company performed impairment tests of goodwill for all of its reporting units, refer to note 8 for further details. Besides goodwill from certain reporting units noted above, there were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the period presented.


Contractual Obligation

At March 31, 2019, the Company had purchase commitments due within one year totaling $0.1 for materials and services through contract manufacturing agreements at negotiated prices. The Company guarantees a fixed cost of certain products used in production to its China strategic partners.

Indirect Tax Contingencies

The Company accrues non-income-tax liabilities for indirect tax matters when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. In the event any losses are sustained in excess of accruals, they are charged against income. In evaluating indirect tax matters, management takes into consideration factors such as historical experience with matters of similar nature, specific facts and circumstances, and the likelihood of prevailing. Management evaluates and updates accruals as matters progress over time. It is reasonably possible that some of the matters for which accruals have not been established could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require recognizing future expenditures. Also, statutes of limitations could expire without the Company paying the taxes for matters for which accruals have been established, which could result in the recognition of future gains upon reversal of these accruals at that time. 



The Company has challenged multiple customs rulings in Thailand seeking to retroactively collect customs duties on previous imports of automatic teller machines (ATMs). In August 2017 and March 2019, the Supreme Court of Thailand ruled in the Company's favor in two of the matters, finding that Customs' attempt to collect duties for importation of ATMs was improper. The surviving matters remain at various stages of the appeals process and the Company will use the Supreme Court's decisions in support of its position in those matters. Management remains confident that the Company has a valid legal position in these appeals. Accordingly, the Company does not have any amount accrued for this contingency.

A loss contingency is reasonably possible if it has a more than remote but less than probable chance of occurring. Although management believes the Company has valid defenses with respect to its indirect tax positions, it is reasonably possible that a loss could occur in excess of the estimated accrual. The Company estimated the aggregate risk at March 31, 2019 to be up to $118.7 for its material indirect tax matters, of which $27.0 related to the Thailand customs matter disclosed above. The aggregate risk related to indirect taxes is adjusted as the applicable statutes of limitations expire.

Legal Contingencies

At December 31, 2018, the Company was a party to several lawsuits that were incurred in the normal course of business, which neither individually nor in the aggregate were considered material by management in relation to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. In management’s opinion, the Company's consolidated financial statements would not be materially affected by the outcome of these legal proceedings, commitments or asserted claims.


Diebold KGaA is a party to appraisal proceedings (Spruchverfahren) relating to the DPLTA entered into by Diebold KGaA and Diebold Nixdorf AG on September 26, 2016, pending at the District Court (Landgericht) of Dortmund (Germany). The appraisal proceedings were filed by minority shareholders of Diebold Nixdorf AG challenging the adequacy of both the cash exit compensation of €55.02 per Diebold Nixdorf AG share and the annual recurring compensation of €2.82 per Diebold Nixdorf AG share offered in connection with the DPLTA. A ruling by the court would apply to all Diebold Nixdorf AG shares outstanding at the time the DPLTA became effective. While the Company believes that the compensation offered in connection with the DPLTA

was fair and the claims lack merit, this matter is still at a preliminary stage and the outcome is uncertain. As a result, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from this litigation.

These work streams are designed to improve the Company’s profitability and net leverage while establishing a foundation for future growth. The gross annualized savings target for DN Now is approximately $400 through 2021, of which $160 is anticipated to be realized during 2019. In order to achieve these savings, the Company has and will continue to restructure the workforce, integrate and optimize systems and processes, transition workloads to lower cost locations and consolidate real estate holdings. By executing on these and other operational improvement activities, the Company expects to increase customer intimacy and satisfaction, while providing career enrichment opportunities for employees and enhancing value for shareholders.

Segments

The Company’s operating structure is focused on its two customer segments - Banking and Retail. Leveraging a broad portfolio of solutions, the Company offers customers the flexibility to purchase the combination of services, software and systems that drive the most value to their business. 

For example, the Company offers end-to-end branch and store automation solutions that consist of the complete value chain of consult, design, build and operate. Branch and store automation helps financial institutions and retailers grow revenue, reduce costs, and increase convenience and security for their customers by migrating routine transactions, typically done inside the branch or store, to lower-cost automated channels. The Company’s advisory services team collaborates with its clients to define the ideal customer experience, modify processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technologies that meet business objectives.

Banking

The Company provides integrated solutions for financial institutions of all sizes designed to help drive operational efficiencies, differentiate the consumer experience, grow revenue and manage risk. Banking operations are managed within two geographic regions. The Eurasia region includes the developed economies of Western Europe as well as the emerging economies of Eastern Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The Americas region encompasses the United States (U.S.), Canada, Mexico and Latin America.

For banking clients, services represents the largest operational component of the Company. Diebold Nixdorf AllConnect Services was launched in 2018 to power the business operations of financial institutions of all sizes. This as-a-service offering provides financial institutions with the capabilities and technology needed to make physical distribution channels as agile, integrated, efficient and differentiated as their digital counterparts by leveraging a data-driven Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure. The Company’s product-related services resolve incidents through remote service capabilities or an on-site visit. The portfolio includes first and second line maintenance, preventive maintenance, “on-demand” and total implementation services. 

Managed services and outsourcing consists of managing the end-to-end business processes, technology integration and day-to-day operation of the self-service channel and the bank branch. Our integrated business solutions include self-service fleet management, branch life-cycle management and ATM as-a-service capabilities.

From a product perspective, the banking portfolio consists of cash recyclers and dispensers, intelligent deposit terminals, teller automation and kiosk technologies, as well as physical security solutions. The Company assists financial institutions to increase the functionality, availability and security within their ATM fleet. 

The Company’s software encompasses front-end applications for consumer connection points as well as back-end platforms which manage channel transactions, operations and integration. These hardware-agnostic software applications facilitate millions of transactions via ATMs, kiosks, and other self-service devices, as well as via online and mobile digital channels. 

In 2017, the Company introduced DN Vynamic™ Software, the first end-to-end Connected Commerce software portfolio in the banking marketplace designed to simplify and enhance the consumer experience. In addition, DN Vynamic suite's open application program interface (API) architecture is built to simplify operations by eliminating the traditional focus on internal silos and enabling tomorrow's inter-connected partnerships between financial institutions and payment providers. In addition, with a shared analytic and transaction engine, the DN Vynamic platform can generate new insights to enhance operations across any channel - putting consumer preferences, not the technology, at the heart of the experience.

DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES




Gross Profit



Services gross margin increased 0.5 percent in the three months ended March 31, 2019, favorably impacted by lower restructuring charges of $0.5 and lower non-routine charges of $2.2 primarily related to a gain on a spare parts inventory provision in 2019 and integration costs in 2018. Excluding restructuring and non-routine charges, services gross margin was relatively flat as services margin increases in the Eurasia banking segment related to the favorable impact of the services modernization initiatives and favorable customer mix were offset by higher software cost in both the Americas banking and retail segments. 

Product gross margin increased 3.3 percent in the three months ended March 31, 2019, favorably impacted by lower restructuring charges of $0.6 and lower non-routine charges of $4.6 primarily related to lower purchase accounting adjustments of amortization and gain on a product inventory provision, partially offset by the reversal of the Brazil indirect tax in the prior year. Excluding the impact of restructuring and non-routine charges, products gross margin increased 1.9 percent due primarily to higher volume and a more favorable solution mix in North America. Additionally, product gross margin improved from a favorable banking customer mix in Eurasia and Latin America, partially offset by increased software cost throughout the segments.

Operating Expenses




Selling and administrative expense in the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased $0.4 including higher incremental restructuring of $0.9 and non-routine charges of $6.1. Excluding the impact of restructuring, non-routine charges and a net favorable currency impact of $8.9, mostly related to the euro, selling and administrative expense increased $2.3, primarily from higher

DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES



expense related to the mark-to-market adjustment of the legacy Wincor Nixdorf stock option program of $6.4 in addition to higher U.S. based associate related expense. These increases are mostly offset by cost reduction initiatives and restructuring programs across the segments tied to the DN Now program.

Non-routine cost in selling and administrative expense was $44.5 in the three months ended March 31, 2019, an increase of $6.1 compared to the prior year. Higher non-routine cost consisted of increased legal and consulting expense of $20.5 inclusive of $5.6 related to the squeeze out real estate tax, and $3.0 related to a one-time non-cash accounts receivable discount in Brazil. These increases were partially offset by lower integration expense of $14.6 and purchase accounting adjustments of $2.6. Selling and administrative expense included restructuring charges of $2.2, or $0.9 higher than the prior year, related to the workforce alignment under the DN Now plan.

Research, development and engineering expense in the three months ended March 31, 2019 decreased $4.8 including a net favorable currency impact of $2.3, primarily related to the euro. Excluding the impact of currency, Research, development and engineering expense decreased $2.5 due primarily from streamlining ATM portfolio as well as lower headcount tied to the Company’s DN Now restructuring program, partially offset by increased software development cost.

Loss of $3.4 on sale of assets recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2019 includes the loss on divestitures of the Venezuela business of $4.1 and a Eurasia non-core business of $2.8, partially offset by a gain on the liquidation of a separate Eurasia non-core business of $3.5. The gain of $7.7 in the prior year was primarily related to the sale of a building in North America of $4.5 and the liquidation of the Barbados operating entity of $3.3.

Operating expense as a percent of net sales in the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased 1.5 percent to 26.1 percent compared to the same period in 2018 due in part to gains on sale of a building in North America and the impact of divestitures as well as lower net sales, partially offset by lower hardware development expense.

Operating Loss



The operating loss increased in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.8, related primarily to the euro and higher non-routine charges. Excluding the impact of currency and non-routine charges, operating profit increased $13.0 primarily related to higher product gross profit in the Americas and Eurasia banking segments from large roll out and upgrade projects.

Other Income (Expense)




Interest income in the three months ended March 31, 2019 decreased $0.6 compared with the same period in 2018, primarily as a result of overall lower average investment balances in Brazil. Interest expense increased $24.9 compared to the same prior-year

DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES



period due to the acquisition of the additional $650.0 of Term Loan A-1 Facility debt with higher incremental interest rates and related fee amortization. Foreign exchange gain increased $4.2 primarily as a result of the currency devaluation in Venezuela operating entity in the current year. Miscellaneous net, decreased $1.3 in the three months ended March 31, 2019, unfavorably impacted by higher costs and lower benefits associated with the company owned life insurance.

Net Loss




The loss before taxes and net loss increased primarily due to the reasons described above. Net loss was also impacted by the change in the income tax expense.

The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations was (85.0) percent for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The expense on the loss is due primarily to the tax impacts of the Tax Act on the estimated projected tax rate. More specifically, the impacts of the GILTI and BEAT. In addition, the Company collapsed its Barbados structure to meet the debt covenant requirements from our lenders during the quarter which resulted in additional discrete tax expense which is being offset in part by the valuation allowance release relating to the Company’s nondeductible interest expense resulting in no additional cash taxes. The above items noted as well as the Company’s jurisdictional income (loss) mix and varying respective statutory rates are the primary drivers of the quarterly tax rate. 

The effective tax rate on the net loss was (40.4) percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The expense on the loss is due primarily from impacts related to GILTI on the estimated annual tax rate.

Segment Net Sales and Operating Profit Summary



Eurasia Banking net sales decreased $52.5 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $35.7 related primarily to the euro. Excluding currency, net sales decreased $16.8 as services revenue decreased primarily from a maintenance contract roll off with a particular customer in India as well as lower products volume in various Asia Pacific countries, most notably in Taiwan from prior year non-recurring project volume. Additionally, software revenue decreased slightly from a non-core business and in Germany. These decreases were partially offset by increased unit replacements in Germany related to Windows 10 upgrades.

Segment operating profit increased $14.2 in the three months ended March 31, 2019, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $4.5, primarily due to the euro. Excluding the impact of currency, operating profit increased $18.7 due in part to higher gross profit on services and products margin improvements. The favorable services margin was primarily attributable to the services modernization program which benefited numerous countries in Europe and Asia, while products margin also benefited from DN

Now initiatives as well as higher volume in Germany. Additionally, segment operating profit benefited from lower operating expenses tied to DN Now initiatives, restructuring programs and the phase out of non-profitable service contracts in India.

Segment operating profit margin increased 4.3 percent from lower operating expense, as well as higher services and products gross margin, primarily attributable to DN Now initiatives.


Americas Banking net sales increased $29.0 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $5.9 related to the Brazil real. Excluding currency, net sales increased $34.9 primarily due to increased installation volume in Canada and the U.S. as well as improved supply chain management in North America. Increased products volume in the Latin America distributor business, Chile and Ecuador drove higher revenue as well as software license volume in Brazil. Partially offsetting these increases, services revenue declined from lower billed work activity and maintenance contract volume in the U.S.

Segment operating profit increased $13.5 mostly from DN Now initiatives favorably impacting both operating expense and gross profit. Additionally, gross profit was favorably impacted by current large product refresh projects in Canada and higher volume in Latin America as well as increased volume in the U.S., as the prior year was unfavorably impacted by supply chain delays. Higher software cost in 2019 partially offset these increases.

Segment operating profit margin increased 3.6 percent, primarily as a result of higher product gross margin, in addition to lower cost related to the DN Now initiatives. 


Retail net sales decreased $12.6 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $24.0 mostly related to the euro. Excluding currency, net sales increased $11.4 primarily from large POS system roll outs in Germany and the U.K. in addition to increased kiosk volume in North America, partially offset by lower software and service volume across the EMEA region. 

Segment operating profit decreased $2.1 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $1.6. Excluding the impact of currency, segment operating profit decreased $0.5 as lower operating expense tied to DN Now initiatives were more than offset by lower software volume and unfavorable software solutions mix as well as under-performance of the Eurasia non-core business. Additionally, products gross profit was relatively flat from increased volume to an unfavorable solution mix in North America and EMEA.

Segment operating profit margin decreased 0.6 percent as lower operating expense tied to the DN Now initiatives, was more than offset by lower software and product gross margin on an unfavorable solution mix.

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $6.0 to $58.4 during the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $64.4 during the same period in 2018 primarily due to a reduction in capital spend. Share-based compensation decreased $4.4 to $9.3 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to a reduction in shares awarded in 2019.

Investing Activities

The maturities and purchases of investments primarily relate to short-term investment activity in Brazil. The $44.7 change was primarily due to a reduction in utilization of short-term investments in Brazil for cash needs.

Financing Activities

Net cash used by financing activities was $13.9 and $91.4 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $77.5. The change was primarily due a decrease in net borrowings (repayments) under the Company's revolving facility and the reduction in dividend payments. The decreases in use were partially offset by $10.5 in higher cash distributions related to the redemption of shares and cash compensation to Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders of $11.0 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $0.5 in the prior-year period.

Refer to note 11 for additional information regarding the Company's debt obligations. As defined by the Company's credit agreement, the ratio of net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA was 5.7 times as of March 31, 2019.

Refer to note 17 for additional information regarding the Company's hedging and derivative instruments.

Dividends The Company paid dividends of $7.7 in the three months ended March 31, 2018.

As a result, there was no quarterly dividend for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The quarterly dividend was $0.10 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018.

Contractual Obligations In the first quarter of 2019, the Company entered into purchase commitments due within one year for materials through contract manufacturing agreements for a total negotiated price.

Except for the items noted above, all contractual cash obligations with initial and remaining terms in excess of one year and contingent liabilities remained generally unchanged at March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various arrangements not recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets that have or could have an effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. The principal off-balance sheet arrangements that the Company enters into are guarantees, operating leases and sales of finance receivables. The Company provides its global operations guarantees and standby letters of credit through various financial institutions to suppliers, customers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers. If the Company is not able to make payment, the suppliers, customers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers may draw on the pertinent bank. Refer to note 9 for further details of guarantees.

DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include revenue recognition, the valuation of trade, finance lease receivables, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, guarantee obligations and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, pension and post-retirement benefits and customer incentives, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors. Management monitors the economic conditions and other factors and will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 

In addition to the items that the Company disclosed as its critical accounting policies and estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, the company adopted ASU 2016-02 and its subsequent amendments related to lease accounting. The standard requires that a lessee recognize on its balance sheet right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities resulting from leasing transactions, as well as additional financial statement disclosures. Previously, U.S. GAAP only required balance sheet recognition for leases classified as capital leases. The provisions of this update apply to substantially all leased assets. Subsequent ASUs related to this standard are updates, which prescribe a practical expedient for implementation and narrow-scope improvements for lessors. For more information regarding the implementation of this standard, refer to note 2.

Forward-Looking Statement Disclosure

In this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, statements that are not reported financial results or other historical information are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance. These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, the Company's future operating performance, the Company's share of new and existing markets, the Company's short- and long-term revenue and earnings growth rates, and the Company's implementation of cost-reduction initiatives and measures to improve pricing, including the optimization of the Company's manufacturing capacity.

The use of the words “will,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions is intended to identify forward-looking statements that have been made and may in the future be made by or on behalf of the Company. Although the Company believes that these forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions regarding, among other things, the economy, its knowledge of its business, and on key performance indicators that impact the Company, these forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. The Company is not obligated to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:

FORM 10-Q as of March 31, 2019


Item 4: Controls and Procedures

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q includes the certifications of the Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) required by Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2. This Item 4 includes information concerning the controls and control evaluations referred to in those certifications.

Based on the performance of procedures by management, designed to ensure the reliability of financial reporting, management believes that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

In connection with the preparation of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the Company's management, under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2019 due to the material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as described below.

A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 and notes that the material weaknesses were not remediated as of March 31, 2019.

The Company’s risk assessment process was not effective in considering changes to the business operations, personnel and other factors affecting certain financial reporting processes and design of related controls on a timely basis. Accordingly,

•The Company had ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) related to IT systems used for financial reporting by certain entities throughout the organization. The Company did not established effective IT and financial user access controls commensurate with certain job responsibilities. Consequently, automated and manual process level controls over financial reporting which were dependent upon these ITGCs were also ineffective.

•The Company had ineffective implementation and operation of controls over inventory valuation related to spare parts and finished goods from canceled orders as the Company did not effectively communicate information to certain locations to allow for the effective operations or implementation of these controls.

•The Company had ineffective controls over non-routine transactions as certain controls were not designed at the appropriate level of precision to ensure calculations supporting non-routine transactions were calculated correctly.

Because of the material weaknesses identified above, a reasonable possibility exists that a material misstatement in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

•Improving our continuous risk assessment process to be responsive to changes in the business operations, personnel and IT developments affecting our financial reporting and related controls;

•Improving our timely written communication of changes in financial reporting and related controls affecting both business and financial users;

•Revoking the access to IT systems of those individuals that were identified as inappropriate;


•Implementing consistent inventory valuation controls at all locations and communicate the requirements for effectively operating such controls to all businesses; and

•Implementing controls over calculations associated with non-routine transactions at a more precise level of operation.

Change in Internal Controls

Other than the material weaknesses described above that occurred in earlier periods of fiscal 2018, there have been no other changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2019 that have materially affective, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
