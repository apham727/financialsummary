  1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Basis of Presentation 

Our fiscal years are based on a 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in December. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 29, 2018, has been derived from our audited financial statements at that date. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 28, 2019, (also referred to as “the third quarter of fiscal 2019” and “the first nine months of fiscal 2019”) and September 29, 2018, (also referred to as “the third quarter of fiscal 2018” and “the first nine months of fiscal 2018”) are unaudited. However, in management’s opinion, these financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal, recurring items) necessary to provide a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, were comprised of 13 and 39 weeks, respectively. 

Our interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that should be expected for the full year. For a better understanding of Cohu, Inc. and our financial statements, we recommend reading these interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended December 29, 2018, which are included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In the following notes to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements, Cohu, Inc. is referred to as “Cohu”, “we”, “our” and “us”. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cohu and a variable interest entity (“VIE”) that was acquired as part of our acquisition of Xcerra Corporation (“Xcerra”) and in which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary. The non-controlling interest in ALBS Solutions Sdn Bhd (“ALBS”) represents the 80% equity interest that is not held by Cohu. ALBS is a privately held corporation which provides high-tech semiconductor automation systems to different industrial users. All significant consolidated transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Principles of Consolidation for Variable Interest Entities 


As of September 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, we consolidated one VIE. Cohu is the primary beneficiary of ALBS which qualifies as a VIE that meets the definition of a business. As such, the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interest of ALBS were measured at fair value upon acquisition in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). The assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses of this VIE are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements. As of September 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, the assets and liabilities of ALBS are immaterial to Cohu and, therefore, not shown separately on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The third-party equity interest of ALBS is referred to as noncontrolling interest. The portion of net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest of ALBS is presented as net income (loss) allocated to noncontrolling interests in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and the portion of stockholders' equity of ALBS is presented as noncontrolling interest in the condensed consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.

Reclassifications 







Concentration of Credit Risk 

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments and trade accounts receivable. We invest in a variety of financial instruments and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer. 

Trade accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.2 million at September 28, 2019, and $0.3 million at December 29, 2018. Our customers include semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors throughout many areas of the world. While we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate and represents our best estimate at September 28, 2019, we will continue to monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions, which may result in changes to our estimates regarding collectability. 

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Cost includes labor, material and overhead costs. Determining net realizable value of inventories involves numerous estimates and judgments including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete and dispose of inventory. As a result of these analyses, we record a charge to cost of sales in advance of the period when the inventory is sold when estimated net realizable values are below our costs.

Property, Plant and Equipment 

Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment, both owned and under financing lease, is calculated principally on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of thirty to forty years for buildings, five to fifteen years for building improvements and three to ten years for machinery, equipment and software. Land is not depreciated. 



Segment Information 


Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Long-lived Assets  

We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment by comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We estimated the fair values of our reporting units primarily using the income approach valuation methodology that includes the discounted cash flow method, taking into consideration the market approach and certain market multiples as a validation of the values derived using the discounted cash flow methodology. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on customer forecasts, industry trade organization data and general economic conditions. 

We conduct our annual impairment test as of October 1st of each year, and have determined there was no impairment as of October 1, 2018 as we determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values on that date. Other events and changes in circumstances may also require goodwill to be tested for impairment between annual measurement dates. As of September 28, 2019, we do not believe that circumstances have occurred that indicate impairment of our goodwill is more-likely-than-not. In the event we determine that an interim goodwill impairment review is required in a future period, the review may result in an impairment charge, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. 

We evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible assets associated with in-process research and development by comparing the fair value of each project with its carrying value. This evaluation is completed annually and whenever indicators of impairment are present. 


Table of Contents  

Cohu, Inc. 

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 


Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. 

Product Warranty 

Product warranty costs are accrued in the period sales are recognized. Our products are generally sold with standard warranty periods, which differ by product, ranging from 12- to 36-months. Parts and labor are typically covered under the terms of the warranty agreement. Our warranty expense accruals are based on historical and estimated costs by product and configuration. From time-to-time we offer customers extended warranties beyond the standard warranty period. In those situations the revenue relating to the extended warranty is deferred at its estimated relative standalone selling price and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Costs associated with our extended warranty contracts are expensed as incurred. 

Restructuring Costs 

We record restructuring activities including costs for one-time termination benefits in accordance with ASC Topic 420 (“ASC 420”), Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. The timing of recognition for severance costs accounted for under ASC 420 depends on whether employees are required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits. If employees are required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits, a liability is recognized ratably over the future service period. Otherwise, a liability is recognized when management has committed to a restructuring plan and has communicated those actions to employees. Employee termination benefits covered by existing benefit arrangements are recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 712, Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits. These costs are recognized when management has committed to a restructuring plan and the severance costs are probable and estimable. 

Debt Issuance Costs  

We capitalized costs related to the issuance of debt. Debt issuance costs directly related to our Term B Loan are presented within noncurrent liabilities as a reduction of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The amortization of such costs is recognized as interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the respective debt issue. Amortization related to deferred debt issuance costs and original discount costs was $0.3 million and $0.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019. We obtained the Term B Loan on October 1, 2018, as a result there were no debt issuance costs amortized during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2018. 

Foreign Remeasurement and Currency Translation  

Assets and liabilities of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that use the U.S. Dollar as their functional currency are re-measured using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, except for nonmonetary assets, such as inventories and property, plant and equipment, which are re-measured using historical exchange rates. Revenues and costs are re-measured using average exchange rates for the period, except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are re-measured using historical exchange rates. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are recognized as incurred. During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019, we recognized foreign exchange gains of $1.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively, in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the three and nine months ended September 29, 2018, we recognized a foreign exchange loss of $0.2 million and a gain of $1.2 million, respectively, in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency and, as a result, their assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date, while revenue and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period. Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements are included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. 

Share-Based Compensation 

We measure and recognize all share-based compensation under the fair value method. Our estimate of share-based compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility, employee exercise patterns (expected life of the options) and related tax effects. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results.

Income (Loss) Per Share  

Basic income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted income (loss) per share includes the dilutive effect of common shares potentially issuable upon the exercise of stock options, vesting of outstanding restricted stock and performance stock units and issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan using the treasury stock method. In loss periods, potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the per share computations due to their anti-dilutive effect. For purposes of computing diluted income (loss) per share, stock options with exercise prices that exceed the average fair market value of our common stock for the period are excluded. For the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019, stock options and awards to issue approximately 459,000 and 487,000 shares of common stock were excluded from the computation, respectively. For the three months ended September 29, 2018, no stock options or awards to issue shares of common stock were excluded from the computation. For the nine months ended September 29, 2018, stock options and awards to issue approximately 12,000 shares of common stock were excluded from the computation. 



Cohu has utilized the “control number” concept in the computation of diluted earnings per share to determine whether potential common stock instruments are dilutive. The control number used is income from continuing operations. The control number concept requires that the same number of potentially dilutive securities applied in computing diluted earnings per share from continuing operations be applied to all other categories of income or loss, regardless of their anti-dilutive effect on such categories. 

Leases 

We adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as of December 30, 2018. We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right of use (“ROU”) assets, current other accrued liabilities, and long-term lease liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, other current accrued liabilities, and long-term lease liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the adoption date or the commencement date for leases entered into after the adoption date. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rates for the remaining lease terms based on the information available at the adoption date or commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. 


Table of Contents  

Cohu, Inc. 

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 


The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made, lease incentives, favorable and unfavorable lease terms recognized in business acquisitions and excludes initial direct costs incurred and variable lease payments. Variable lease payments include estimated payments that are subject to reconciliations throughout the lease term, increases or decreases in the contractual rent payments as a result of changes in indices or interest rates and tax payments that are based on prevailing rates. Our lease terms may include renewal options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options. In addition, we include purchase option amounts in our calculations when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options. Rent expense for minimum payments under operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term. 

Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, but recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component and include both in our calculation of the ROU assets and lease liabilities. 

We sublease certain leased assets to third parties, mainly as a result of unused space in our facilities. None of our subleases contain extension options. Variable lease payments in our subleases include tax payments that are based on prevailing rates. We account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. 

Revenue Recognition 

Our net sales are derived from the sale of products and services and are adjusted for estimated returns and allowances, which historically have been insignificant. We recognize revenue when the obligations under the terms of a contract with our customers are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of our systems, non-system products or services. In circumstances where control is not transferred until destination or acceptance, we defer revenue recognition until such events occur. 

Revenue for established products that have previously satisfied a customer’s acceptance requirements is generally recognized upon shipment. In cases where a prior history of customer acceptance cannot be demonstrated or from sales where customer payment dates are not determinable and in the case of new products, revenue and cost of sales are deferred until customer acceptance has been received. Our post-shipment obligations typically include installation and standard warranties. The relative standalone selling price of installation related revenue is recognized in the period the installation is performed. Service revenue is recognized over time as we transfer control to our customer for the related contract or upon completion of the services if they are short-term in nature. Spares, contactor and kit revenue is generally recognized upon shipment. 

Certain of our equipment sales have multiple performance obligations. These arrangements involve the delivery or performance of multiple performance obligations, and transfer of control of performance obligations may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time. For arrangements containing multiple performance obligations, the revenue relating to the undelivered performance obligation is deferred using the relative standalone selling price method utilizing estimated sales prices until satisfaction of the deferred performance obligation. 

Unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates. At September 28, 2019, we have $12.2 million of revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) for contracts with original expected durations of over one year. As allowed under ASC 606, we have opted to not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with original expected durations of less than one year. 

We generally sell our equipment with a product warranty. The product warranty provides assurance to customers that delivered products are as specified in the contract (an “assurance-type warranty”). Therefore, we account for such product warranties under ASC 460, Guarantees (ASC 460), and not as a separate performance obligation. 

The transaction price reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts. Fixed consideration primarily includes sales to customers that are known as of the end of the reporting period. Variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period. Such consideration primarily includes sales made to certain customers with cumulative tier volume discounts offered. Variable consideration arrangements are rare; however, when they occur, we estimate variable consideration as the expected value to which we expect to be entitled. Included in the transaction price estimate are amounts in which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Variable consideration that does not meet revenue recognition criteria is deferred.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 


Our contracts are typically less than one year in duration and we have elected to use the practical expedient available in ASC 606 to expense cost to obtain contracts as they are incurred because they would be amortized over less than one year. 

Accounts receivable represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customer. Payments terms do not exceed one year from the invoice date and therefore do not include a significant financing component. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheet in any of the periods presented. 

On shipments where sales are not recognized, gross profit is generally recorded as deferred profit in our condensed consolidated balance sheet representing the difference between the receivable recorded and the inventory shipped. At September 28, 2019, we had deferred revenue totaling approximately $16.2 million, current deferred profit of $8.0 million and deferred profit expected to be recognized after one year included in noncurrent other accrued liabilities of $5.8 million. At December 29, 2018, we had deferred revenue totaling approximately $10.8 million, current deferred profit of $6.9 million and deferred profit expected to be recognized after one year included in noncurrent other accrued liabilities of $2.0 million.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 

Our accumulated other comprehensive loss balance totaled approximately $40.3 million and $25.9 million at September 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively, and was attributed to all non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity and consists of, on an after-tax basis where applicable, foreign currency adjustments resulting from the translation of certain of our subsidiary accounts where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar and adjustments related to postretirement benefits. Reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were not significant. 

Retiree Medical Benefits 

We provide post-retirement health benefits to certain retired executives, one director (who is a former executive) and their eligible dependents under a noncontributory plan. These benefits are no longer offered to any other retired Cohu employees. The net periodic benefit cost incurred during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 was not significant. 

Discontinued Operations 

Management has determined that the fixtures services business, that was acquired as part of Xcerra, does not align with Cohu’s long-term strategic plan and management is in the process of divesting this portion of the business. As a result, the assets of our fixtures business are considered “held for sale” and the operations of our fixtures business are considered “discontinued operations” as of December 29, 2018. See Note 10, “Discontinued Operations” for additional information. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts herein relate to continuing operations. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  

We adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as of December 30, 2018, using the optional transition method which allowed us to record existing leases at adoption and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption rather than in the earliest period presented. We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carryforward the historical lease classification. 

We made an accounting policy election to not record ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. We recognized those lease payments in our condensed consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We also made an accounting policy election to use the practical expedient allowed in the standard to not separate lease and non-lease components when calculating the ROU asset and lease liability. Related to adoption of the new standard, we have implemented internal controls and a lease accounting technology system to track the ROU asset and lease liability balances and prepare the related footnote disclosures. 


Table of Contents  

Cohu, Inc. 

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 


Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of additional net lease assets and lease liabilities of approximately $30.7 million and $29.9 million, respectively, as of December 30, 2018. We had previously recorded a sale and operating leaseback transaction in accordance with Topic 840 and as a result of the adoption of the new standard, recognized $10.2 million of deferred gain as an adjustment to retained earnings. In addition, we had previously recognized assets and liabilities related to a build-to-suit designation under Topic 840 and as a result of the adoption of the new standard, derecognized assets and liabilities of $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, with the difference recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. The standard did not materially impact our consolidated net earnings and had no impact on cash flows. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  


In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, which improves defined benefit disclosure requirements by removing disclosures that are not cost beneficial, clarifying disclosures’ specific requirements and adding relevant disclosure requirements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this ASU are required to be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. We are currently assessing and have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of ASU 2018-14 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which improves fair value disclosure requirements by removing disclosures that are not cost beneficial, clarifying disclosures’ specific requirements and adding relevant disclosure requirements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. Early adoption is permitted and an entity can choose to early adopt any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance of this ASU and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. We are currently assessing and have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of ASU 2018-13 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  

  2.    Business Acquisitions, Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets    

Xcerra 

Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) dated as of May 7, 2018, among Cohu, Xcerra, and Xavier Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Cohu (“Merger Sub”), Merger Sub merged with and into Xcerra (the “Merger”), with Xcerra surviving such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Cohu. The Merger was effective on October 1, 2018 (“the Effective Time”). At the Effective Time, each share of Xcerra Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than dissenting shares and shares held by Cohu, Merger Sub, Xcerra or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cohu or Xcerra) was converted into the right to receive, in the aggregate for all shares of Xcerra Common Stock, consideration, which totaled approximately $794.4 million as of the Effective Time. 


Table of Contents

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 



    ●   $160.5 million cash from our combined balance sheets;    

    ●   The incurrence of $350.0 million from the Credit Facility, as described below;    

    ●   The issuance of 11,776,149 shares of Cohu common stock; and    

    ●   The issuance of 529,995 converted RSUs to Xcerra employees, of which $0.8 million of the fair value of the converted RSUs was attributed to pre-merger services.    


Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Xcerra RSU that was vested was cancelled and the holder received cash and share consideration for the outstanding shares. Each unvested RSU held by employees of Xcerra were assumed by Cohu and converted into an RSU representing the number of whole shares of Cohu common stock based on a conversion formula resulting in the number of assumed RSUs described above. 

The acquisition method of accounting is based on ASC 805, and uses the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”). The purchase price allocation described herein contains adjustments made during the post-acquisition measurement period, which were made as a result of obtaining new facts and circumstances related to certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The net impact of the measurement period adjustments were offset against goodwill. 

The acquisition was nontaxable to Cohu and certain of the assets acquired, including goodwill and intangibles, will not be deductible for tax purposes. The acquired assets and liabilities of Xcerra were recorded at their respective fair values including an amount for goodwill which represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, and is attributable primarily to expected synergies, economies of scale and the assembled workforce of Xcerra. Goodwill has been allocated to our THG, STG, ISG and PTG operating segments. 

ASC 805 requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. In addition, ASC 805 requires that the consideration transferred be measured at the date the merger is completed at the then-current market price. The market price of the shares of Cohu Common Stock at the Effective Time was $25.10 which was based upon the closing price of shares of Cohu Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on Friday, September 28, 2018, the last day of trading prior to the Effective Time.

Cohu, Inc. 

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 



Under ASC 805, acquisition-related transaction costs (e.g., advisory, legal, investment banking and other professional fees) are not included as a component of consideration transferred but are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which such costs are incurred. Total Merger-related transaction costs, that exclude other costs related to employee termination and restructuring, incurred by Cohu were $0.4 million and $5.2 million in the first nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively. 




We recorded a $19.6 million step-up of inventory to its fair value as of the acquisition date. 



Acquired intangible assets reported above are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which approximates the pattern of how the economic benefit is expected to be used. This includes amounts allocated to customer relationships because of anticipated high customer retention rates that are common in the semiconductor capital equipment industry.

The value assigned to developed technology was determined by using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. Developed technology, which comprises products that have reached technological feasibility, includes the products in Xcerra’s product line. The revenue estimates used to value the developed technology were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by Xcerra and competitors. The estimated cash flows were based on revenues for the developed technology net of operating expenses and net of contributory asset charges. The discount rate utilized to discount the net cash flows of the developed technology to present value was based on the risk associated with the respective cash flows taking into consideration the perceived risk of the technology relative to the other acquired assets, the weighted average cost of capital, the internal rate of return, and the weighted average return on assets. 

The value assigned to customer relationships was determined by using the with and without method under the income approach, which analyzes the difference in discounted cash flows generated with the customer relationships in place compared to the discounted cash flows generated without the customer relationships in place. 


The value assigned to backlog acquired was estimated based upon the contractual nature of the backlog as of October 1, 2018, using the income approach to discount back to present value the cash flows attributable to the backlog. 

The value assigned to trademarks and trade names was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. This approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this intangible asset. 

In our estimate of the fair value of Xcerra’s net assets, Cohu identified leases that appear to be at both favorable and unfavorable rates compared to current market rates.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 




    (2)   Amounts represent adjustments made during the post-acquisition measurement period to the preliminary goodwill from the Xcerra acquisition.    





Amortization expense related to intangible assets was approximately $10.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and $30.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. Amortization expense related to intangible assets was approximately $1.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and $3.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. The increase in amortization expense in the current year is the result of amortization of assets acquired in the Xcerra transaction.

  3.    Borrowings and Credit Agreements    



  (1)   Excludes capital lease obligations, which are included in long-term and short-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet, as they were not material at December 29, 2018.    

Credit Agreement 

On October 1, 2018, we entered into a Credit Agreement providing for a $350.0 million Credit Facility and borrowed the full amount. Loans under the Credit Facility amortize in equal quarterly installments of 0.25% of the original principal amount, with the balance payable at maturity. All outstanding principal and interest in respect of the Credit Facility must be repaid on or before October 1, 2025. The loans under the Term Loan Facility bear interest, at Cohu’s option, at a floating annual rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 3.00%. At September 28, 2019, the outstanding loan balance, net of discount and deferred financing costs, was $338.8 million and $2.4 million of the outstanding balance is presented as current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 28, 2019, the fair value of the debt was $332.2 million. The measurement of the fair value of debt is based on the average of the bid and ask trading quotes as of September 28, 2019 and is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement. See Note 2, “Business Acquisitions, Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” for additional information on the Credit Facility. 

Kita Term Loans 

As a result of our acquisition of Kita, we assumed term loans from a series of Japanese financial institutions primarily related to the expansion of Kita’s facility in Osaka, Japan. The loans are collateralized by the facility and land, carry interest rates ranging from 0.05% to 0.44%, and expire at various dates through 2034. At September 28, 2019, the outstanding loan balance was $4.0 million and $0.5 million of the outstanding balance is presented as current installments of long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt approximates the carrying value at September 28, 2019. 

The term loans are denominated in Japanese Yen and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates. 

Xcerra Term Loan 

As a result of our acquisition of Xcerra, we assumed a term loan related to the purchase of Xcerra’s facility in Rosenheim, Germany. The loan is payable over 10 years at an annual interest rate of 2.35%. Principal plus accrued interest is due quarterly over the duration of the term loan ending in March 2024. At September 28, 2019, the outstanding loan balance was $1.5 million and $0.3 million of the outstanding balance is presented as current installments of long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt approximates the carrying value at September 28, 2019. 

The term loan is denominated in Euros and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates.

Rasco Term Loan 

On July 26, 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary Rasco GmbH entered into a term loan agreement with a financial institution in Germany that provided €3.4 million (Euro) that is being used to finance the expansion of our facility in Kolbermoor, Germany. The facility expansion project will allow us to combine the operations of multiple subsidiaries in one location as part of our strategic restructuring program. The loan is secured by the land and the existing building on the site. The loan is payable over 10 years at an annual interest rate of 0.8%. Principal repayments will be made over 8 years starting at the end of 2021. Only interest will be due each quarter starting in September 2019 and principal plus accrued interest will be due each quarter starting at the end of December, 2021. At September 28, 2019, the outstanding loan balance was $3.7 million with none of the outstanding balance being presented as current installments of long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets based on contractual due dates. The term loan is denominated in Euros and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of the debt approximates the carrying value at September 28, 2019. 

Lines of Credit 

As a result of our acquisition of Kita, we assumed a series of revolving credit facilities with various financial institutions in Japan. The credit facilities renew monthly and provide Kita with access to working capital totaling up to $8.9 million. At September 28, 2019, total borrowings outstanding under the revolving lines of credit were $3.3 million. As these credit facility agreements renew monthly, they have been included in short-term borrowings in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

The revolving lines of credit are denominated in Japanese Yen and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates. 

Our wholly owned Ismeca subsidiary has one available line of credit which provides it with borrowings of up to a total of 2.0 million Swiss Francs. At September 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit.  


Subsequent to the acquisition of Xcerra on October 1st, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we began a strategic restructuring program designed to reposition our organization and improve our cost structure as part of our targeted integration plan regarding the recently acquired Xcerra (“Integration Program”). See Note 2, “Business Acquisitions, Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” for additional information regarding the acquisition of Xcerra. As part of the Integration Program we will consolidate our global handler and contactor manufacturing operations and expect to close our manufacturing operations in Penang, Malaysia and Fontana, California by the end of calendar year 2019. Relating to the facility consolidation actions, we notified certain impacted employees of a reduction in force program. In the second quarter of 2019, we entered into a social plan (“Plan”) with the German labor organization representing certain of the employees of our wholly owned subsidiary, Multitest elektronische Systeme GmbH, as part of our Integration Program. The Plan will reduce headcount, enable us to consolidate the facilities of our multiple operations located near Rosenheim, Germany, as well as transition certain manufacturing to other lower cost regions. The facility consolidation and reduction in force programs are being implemented as part of a comprehensive review of our operations and are intended to streamline and reduce our operating cost structure and capitalize on acquisition synergies. 


Costs associated with restructuring activities are presented in our condensed consolidated statements of operations as restructuring charges, except for certain costs associated with inventory charges related to the decision to end manufacturing of certain of Xcerra’s semiconductor test handler products, which are classified within cost of sales. Other restructuring costs include expenses for professional fees associated with employee severance and impairments of fixed assets.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 




At September 28, 2019, our total accrual for restructuring related items is reflected within current liabilities of our condensed consolidated balance sheets as these amounts are expected to be paid out within a year. The estimated costs associated with the employee severance and facility consolidation actions will be paid predominantly in cash, with the exception of the amortization of leasehold improvements which is non-cash.  

  5.    Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value     

Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments consisted primarily of cash and other investment grade securities. We do not hold investment securities for trading purposes. All short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. Investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk and we monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate exposure by making high-quality investments and through investment diversification. 






As of September 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, there were no investments in our portfolio in a loss position.

  6.    Employee Stock Benefit Plans    

Our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”) is a broad-based, long-term retention program intended to attract, motivate, and retain talented employees as well as align stockholder and employee interests. Awards that may be granted under the program include, but are not limited to, non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock units, and performance stock units. We settle employee stock option exercises, employee stock purchase plan purchases, and the vesting of restricted stock units, and performance stock units with newly issued common shares. At September 28, 2019, there were 2,507,028 shares available for future equity grants under the 2005 Plan. 

Stock Options 

Stock options may be granted to employees, consultants and non-employee directors to purchase a fixed number of shares of our common stock. The exercise prices of options granted are at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the dates of grant and options vest and become exercisable in annual increments that range from one to four years from the date of grant. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan have a maximum contractual term of ten years. In the first nine months of fiscal 2019 we did not grant any stock options and we issued 36,650 shares of our common stock on the exercise of options that were granted previously. 

At September 28, 2019, we had 368,276 stock options exercisable and outstanding. These options had a weighted-average exercise price of $10.34 per share, an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately $1.2 million and the weighted average remaining contractual term was approximately 3.0 years.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 


Restricted Stock Units 

We grant restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to certain employees, consultants and directors. RSUs vest in annual increments that range from one to four years from the date of grant. Prior to vesting, RSUs do not have dividend equivalent rights, do not have voting rights and the shares underlying the RSUs are not considered issued and outstanding. New shares of our common stock will be issued on the date the RSUs vest net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number of RSUs outstanding at September 28, 2019. 

In the first nine months of fiscal 2019 we awarded 670,737 RSUs and we issued 560,795 shares of our common stock on vesting of previously granted awards. At September 28, 2019, we had 1,331,427 RSUs outstanding with an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately $17.8 million and the weighted average remaining vesting period was approximately 1.4 years. 

Performance Stock Units  

We also grant performance stock units (“PSUs”) to senior executives as a part of our long-term equity compensation program. The number of shares of common stock that will ultimately be issued to settle PSUs granted in 2019, 2018 and 2017 ranges from 25% to 200% of the number granted and is determined based on certain performance criteria over a three-year measurement period. The performance criteria for the PSUs are based on a combination of our annualized Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) for the performance period and the relative performance of our TSR compared with the annualized TSR of certain peer companies for the performance period. PSUs granted in 2019, 2018 and 2017 vest 100% on the third anniversary of their grant, assuming achievement of the applicable performance criteria. 

We estimated the fair value of the PSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the derived service period. New shares of our common stock will be issued on the date the PSUs vest net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number outstanding at September 28, 2019. 

In the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we awarded 167,226 PSUs and we issued 35,696 shares of our common stock on vesting of previously granted awards. At September 28, 2019, we had 364,194 PSUs outstanding with an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately $4.9 million and the weighted average remaining vesting period was approximately 1.6 years. 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

The Cohu, Inc. 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“the ESPP”) provides for the issuance of shares of our common stock. Under the ESPP, eligible employees may purchase shares of Cohu common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85 percent of the lower of the fair market value of Cohu common stock at the beginning or end of each 6-month purchase period, subject to certain limits. During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, 63,998 shares of our common stock were sold to our employees under the ESPP leaving 1,034,612 shares available for future issuance.  


Ordinarily, interim tax provisions are calculated using the estimated effective tax rate (“ETR”) expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. However, when a reliable estimate of the annual ETR cannot be made, the actual ETR for the year-to-date period may be the best estimate of the annual ETR. For the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019, we used the actual year-to-date ETR in computing our tax provision, as a reliable estimate of the 2019 annual ETR cannot be made, since relatively small changes in our projected income produce a significant variation in our ETR. In computing the tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2018, we used the ETR expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. The ETR on income or loss from continuing operations for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 was (13.9)% and 32.4%, respectively, and (0.3)% and 21.9% for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively. The tax provision on income or loss from continuing operations in 2019 and 2018 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the lack of a tax benefit on our domestic losses as a result of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, foreign income taxed at different rates, changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, withholding tax, state taxes and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits.

For revenues by geography and information on customer concentration, see Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”.  


We lease certain of our facilities, equipment and vehicles under non-cancelable operating and finance leases. Leases with initial terms with 12 months or less are not recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, but we recognized those lease payments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease and non-lease components are included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liabilities. 

Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 38 years, some of which include one or more options to extend the leases for up to 25 years. Our lease term includes renewal terms when we are reasonably certain we will exercise the renewal options.

On October 1, 2018, we acquired a fixtures services business as part of Xcerra. In the fourth quarter of 2018, our management determined that this business did not align with our core business and was not a strategic fit within our organization. As a result, the fixtures services business has been marketed for sale since we acquired Xcerra on October 1, 2018. We expect to complete the sale of this business within 12 months and it qualifies to be reported as discontinued operations. For financial statement purposes, the results of operations for this business have been segregated from those of continuing operations and are presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.

Contingencies    

From time-to-time we are involved in various legal proceedings, examinations by various tax authorities and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain. While there can be no assurance, we do not believe at the present time that the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our assets, financial position or results of operations.

Guarantees     

Product Warranty 

Our products are generally sold with warranty periods that range from 12 to 36 months following sale or acceptance. The product warranty promises customers that delivered products are as specified in the contract (an “assurance-type warranty”). Therefore, we account for such product warranties under ASC 460, and not as a separate performance obligation. Parts and labor are covered under the terms of the warranty agreement. The warranty provision is based on historical and projected experience by product and configuration. 



Accrued warranty amounts expected to be incurred after one year are included in noncurrent other accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. These amounts total $0.2 million at both September 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018.

 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements including expectations of market conditions, challenges and plans, within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is subject to the Safe Harbor provisions created by that statute. Such forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs, including estimates and projections about our business and include, but are not limited to, statements concerning financial position, business strategy, and plans or objectives for future operations. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict and may cause actual results to differ materially from management’s current expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include those set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Item 1A. Risk Factors”. The forward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the time they are made, and do not necessarily reflect management’s outlook at any other point in time. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or for any other reason, however, readers should carefully review the risk factors set forth in other reports or documents we file from time to time with the SEC after the date of this Quarterly Report. 

OVERVIEW 

Cohu is a leading supplier of semiconductor test and inspection handlers, micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) test modules, test contactors and thermal subsystems, semiconductor automated test equipment and bare-board printed circuit board test systems used by global semiconductor and electronics manufacturers and test subcontractors. We offer a wide range of products and services and our revenue from capital equipment products is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their business. The level of capital expenditures by these companies depends on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductor devices and PCBs and the products that incorporate them. Our consumable products are driven by the number of semiconductor devices and printed circuit boards that are tested and by the continuous introduction of new products and new technologies by our customers. As a result, our consumable products provide a more stable recurring source of revenue and generally do not have the same degree of cyclicality as our capital equipment products. 

For the nine months ended September 28, 2019, our net sales increased 57% year-over-year to $441.3 million. The increase in our net sales was driven by the acquisition of Xcerra Corporation, completed on October 1, 2018, and our results in the first nine months of 2019 included sales of $238.9 million contributed by this acquired business. Current market weakness is being driven by lower smartphone unit shipments, weaker automotive semiconductor demand and ongoing softness in the China market that is in part related to trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the impact of export restrictions to Huawei on our customers. 

The global semiconductor market grew in 2018 reaching a peak in the second quarter with business conditions softening during the second half of 2018. This weakness has continued through the first nine months of 2019 and customer test cell utilization remains below levels that have historically triggered the need for additional capacity. The current near-term outlook for the semiconductor industry for the remainder of 2019 assumes slower electronic equipment demand and slower growth for the global economy. Despite the near-term weakness, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business due to increasing ubiquity of semiconductors, the future rollout of 5G networks, diminishing impact of parallel test, increasing semiconductor complexity, increasing quality demands from semiconductor customers, and continued proliferation of electronics in a variety of products across the automotive, mobility and industrial markets. We are focused on growing our market share with semiconductor and electronics manufacturers and test subcontractors. 

Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience, forecasts and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.

We conduct our annual impairment test as of October 1st of each year, and have determined there was no impairment as of October 1, 2018, as we determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values on that date. Other events and changes in circumstances may also require goodwill to be tested for impairment between annual measurement dates. As of September 28, 2019, we do not believe that circumstances have occurred that indicate impairment of our goodwill is more-likely-than-not. In the event we determine that an interim goodwill impairment review is required, in a future period, the review may result in an impairment charge, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. 

Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

For a description of accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see “Recent Accounting Pronouncements”, in Note 1 located in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Recent Transactions Impacting Results of Operations 

On October 1, 2018 we completed the acquisition of Xcerra Corporation and the results of its operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements only since that date. Management has determined that the fixtures services business, that was acquired as part of Xcerra, does not align with Cohu’s long-term strategic plan and management is in the process of divesting this portion of the business. As a result, the assets of our fixtures business are considered “held for sale” and the operations of our fixtures business are considered “discontinued operations” as of September 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018. Unless otherwise indicated, the discussion below covers the comparative results from continuing operations. 



Third Quarter of Fiscal 2019 Compared to Third Quarter of Fiscal 2018 

Net Sales 

Our consolidated net sales increased 66.5% to $143.5 million in 2019, compared to $86.2 million in 2018. On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Xcerra and our net sales for the third fiscal quarter of 2019 include $81.3 million of net sales recognized by this business and is the driver of the increase in our net sales. Excluding the impact of the additional sales from Xcerra, net sales decreased year over year as a result of softer demand for smartphones, weaker automotive semiconductor demand, ongoing softness in the China market that is in part related to trade tensions between the U.S. and China and export restrictions.

Gross Margin (exclusive of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets described below) 

Gross margin consists of net sales less cost of sales. Cost of sales consists primarily of the materials, assembly and test labor and overhead from operations. Our gross margin can fluctuate due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the mix and volume of products sold, product support costs, increases to inventory reserves or the sale of previously reserved inventory and utilization of manufacturing capacity. Our gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 41.1% in 2019 and 40.6% in 2018. As discussed above certain items which have historically affected gross margin are now being reflected in operating expenses. Previously reported amounts were also adjusted to reflect current period presentation. This resulted in expenses totaling $7.6 million and $0.6 million being reported in amortization of intangibles rather than cost of sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Independent of the impact of the financial statement reclassifications gross margin in 2019 was impacted by the acquisition of Xcerra as discussed below. 

Our gross margin can be impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess, obsolete and lower of cost or net realizable value inventory issues. We compute the majority of our excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a one-year inventory usage forecast. During the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, we recorded charges to cost of sales of $1.5 million and $0.7 million for excess and obsolete inventory, respectively. Additionally, as part of the integration and restructuring activities related to Xcerra we recorded $19.1 million of inventory related charges related to the decision to end manufacturing of certain of Xcerra’s semiconductor test handler products in the fourth quarter of 2018 which included amounts associated with non-cancelable supplier commitments. 

While we believe our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or net realizable value concerns are adequate to cover known exposures at September 28, 2019, reductions in customer forecasts or continued modifications to products, as a result of our failure to meet specifications or other customer requirements, may result in additional charges to operations that could negatively impact our gross margin in future periods.

Interest expense was $5.0 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2019 as compared to $11,000 in the corresponding period of 2018. The increase was driven primarily by interest associated with the Term B Loan obtained to finance part of the purchase price of Xcerra. 

Interest income was $0.2 million and $0.3 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Income Taxes 

Ordinarily, interim tax provisions are calculated using the estimated effective tax rate (“ETR”) expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. However, when a reliable estimate of the annual ETR cannot be made, the actual ETR for the year-to-date period may be the best estimate of the annual ETR. For the three months ended September 28, 2019, we used the actual year-to-date ETR in computing our tax provision, as a reliable estimate of the 2019 annual ETR cannot be made, since relatively small changes in our projected income produce a significant variation in our ETR. In computing the tax provision for the three months ended September 29, 2018 we used the ETR expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. The ETR on income or loss from continuing operations for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, was (13.9)% and 32.4%, respectively. The tax provision on income or loss from continuing operations in 2019 and 2018 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the lack of a tax benefit on our domestic losses as a result of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, foreign income taxed at different rates, changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, withholding tax, state taxes and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits. 

Our German subsidiary’s income tax returns for 2012 to 2016 are currently under routine examination by tax authorities in Germany. We believe our financial statement accruals for income taxes are appropriate. 

Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income 

As a result of the factors set forth above, both loss from continuing operations and net loss was $10.5 million in 2019. Both income from continuing operations and net income was $4.8 million in 2018. 

First Nine Months of Fiscal 2019 Compared to First Nine Months of Fiscal 2018 

Net Sales 

Our consolidated net sales increased 57.0% to $441.3 million in 2019, compared to $281.1 million in 2018. On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Xcerra and our net sales for the first nine months of 2019 include $238.9 million of net sales recognized by this business and is the driver of the increase in our net sales. Excluding the impact of the additional sales from Xcerra, net sales decreased year over year as a result of softer demand for smartphones, weaker automotive semiconductor demand, ongoing softness in the China market that is in part related to trade tensions between the U.S. and China and export restrictions. 

Gross Margin (exclusive of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets described below) 

Our gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 39.8% in 2019 from 41.8% in 2018. Our gross margin can fluctuate due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the mix of products sold, product support costs, inventory reserve adjustments, and utilization of manufacturing capacity. As discussed above certain items which have historically affected gross margin are now being reflected in operating expenses. Previously reported amounts were also adjusted to reflect current period presentation. This resulted in expenses totaling $22.9 million and $2.0 million being reported in amortization of intangibles rather than cost of sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Independent of the impact of the financial statement reclassifications gross margin in 2019 was impacted by the acquisition of Xcerra as discussed below.

 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


Our cost of sales was impacted by the amortization of inventory step-up related to fair value adjustments to inventory acquired in business combinations. During the first nine months of 2019, we amortized $6.0 million of inventory step-up related to our acquisition of Xcerra. There was no inventory step-up amortized in the corresponding period of 2018. 

In the first nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 we recorded charges to cost of sales of approximately $3.2 million and $1.3 million for excess and obsolete inventory, respectively. Additionally, as part of the integration and restructuring activities related to Xcerra we recorded $19.1 million of inventory related charges related to the decision to end manufacturing of certain of Xcerra’s semiconductor test handler products in the fourth quarter of 2018 which included amounts associated with non-cancelable supplier commitments. While we believe our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns are adequate to cover known exposures at September 28, 2019, reductions in customer forecasts or continued modifications to products, as a result of our failure to meet specifications or other customer requirements, may result in additional charges to operations that could negatively impact our results of operations and gross margin in future periods. 





Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets 


See Note 2, “Business Acquisitions, Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information with respect to intangible assets. 

Restructuring Charges 

Subsequent to the acquisition of Xcerra on October 1, 2018, during fourth quarter 2018, we began a strategic restructuring program designed to reposition our organization and improve our cost structure as part of our targeted integration plan regarding Xcerra and recorded restructuring charges, exclusive of the inventory related amounts described above, totaling $10.7 million in the first nine months of 2019. 

See Note 4, “Restructuring Charges” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information with respect to restructuring charges. 

Interest Expense and Income 

Interest expense was $15.8 million in the first nine months of 2019 as compared to $33,000 in the corresponding period of 2018. The increase was driven primarily by interest associated with the Term B Loan obtained to finance part of the purchase price of Xcerra.

 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


Interest income was $0.6 million and $0.9 million in the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Income Taxes 

The ETR on income or loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, was (0.3)% and 21.9%, respectively. The tax provision on income or loss from continuing operations in 2019 and 2018 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income taxed at different rates, changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, withholding tax, state taxes and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits.  

There was no material change to our unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest and penalties during the nine-month periods ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018. 

Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income 

As a result of the factors set forth above, our loss from continuing operations and net loss was $52.7 million and $52.4 million in 2019, respectively, as compared to income from continuing operations and net income of $24.6 million in 2018. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Our primary business is dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and test subcontractors that are, in turn, dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors. The seasonal and volatile nature of demand for semiconductor equipment, our primary industry, makes estimates of future revenues, results of operations and net cash flows difficult. 

Our primary historical source of liquidity and capital resources has been cash flow generated by our operations and we manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as our primary source of liquidity. We use cash to fund growth in our operating assets and to fund new products and product enhancements primarily through research and development. As of September 28, 2019, $82.5 million or 56.6% of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we may be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding taxes if we repatriate these funds. Except for working capital requirements in certain jurisdictions, we provide for all withholding and other residual taxes related to unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Beginning in 2018, earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions will be subject to U.S. tax in accordance with the Tax Act. 

On October 1, 2018, we entered into a bank credit agreement which provides for a $350.0 million seven-year Term B Loan facility and borrowed the full amount. The Term B Loan facility matures on October 1, 2025. These proceeds were used on October 1, 2018, together with our cash and cash equivalents and newly issued Cohu common stock, to finance the acquisition of Xcerra. See Note 3 “Borrowings and Credit Agreements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

At September 28, 2019, our total indebtedness, net of discount and deferred financing costs, was $351.3 million, which included $338.8 million outstanding under the Term B Loan, $4.0 million outstanding under Kita’s term loans, $3.7 million outstanding under Rasco’s term loan, $3.3 million outstanding under Kita’s lines of credit, and $1.5 million outstanding under Xcerra’s term loan.

Capital Resources 

In addition to the bank credit agreement which provides for a $350.0 million seven-year Term B Loan facility as described above, we have access to other credit facilities to finance our operations if needed. 

As a result of our acquisition of Xcerra, we assumed a term loan related to the purchase of Xcerra’s facility in Rosenheim, Germany. The loan is payable over 10 years at an annual interest rate of 2.35%. Principal plus accrued interest is due quarterly over the duration of the term loan. At September 28, 2019, the outstanding loan balance was $1.5 million and $0.3 million of the outstanding balance is presented as current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The term loan is denominated in Euros and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates. 

In connection with the acquisition of Kita on January 4, 2017, we assumed a series of revolving credit agreements with various financial institutions in Japan. The credit facilities renew monthly and provide Kita with access to working capital totaling up to $8.9 million. At September 28, 2019, total borrowings outstanding under the revolving lines of credit were $3.3 million. As these credit facility agreements renew monthly, they have been included in short-term borrowings in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. We also have long-term term loans from a series of Japanese financial institutions totaling $4.0 million primarily related to the expansion of Kita’s facility in Osaka, Japan. The loans are collateralized by the facility and land. The loans carry interest rates ranging from 0.05% to 0.44% and expire at various dates through 2034. At September 28, 2019, $0.5 million of the term loans have been included in current installments of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The revolving lines of credit and term loans are denominated in Japanese Yen and, as a result, amounts will fluctuate as a result of changes in currency exchange rates. 

On July 26, 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary Rasco GmbH entered into a term loan agreement with a financial institution that provides it with €3.4 million (Euro) that is being used to finance the expansion of our facility in Kolbermoor, Germany. The facility expansion project will allow us to combine the operations of multiple subsidiaries in one location as part of our strategic restructuring program. The loan is secured by the land and the existing building on the site. Interest on the loan is payable quarterly and is fixed for 10 years at an annual interest rate of 0.8%. Principal repayments will be made over 8 years starting at the end of 2021. Only interest will be due each quarter starting in September 2019 and principal plus accrued interest will be due each quarter starting at the end of December, 2021. At September 28, 2019, the outstanding loan balance was $3.7 million with none of the outstanding balance being presented as current installments of long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets based on contractual due dates. The term loan is denominated in Euros and, as a result, amounts disclosed herein will fluctuate because of changes in currency exchange rates.

We also have a credit agreement with a financial institution under which it administers a line of credit on behalf of our wholly owned Ismeca subsidiary. The agreement provides Ismeca with 2.0 million Swiss Francs of available credit and at September 28, 2019, no amounts were outstanding. 

We have a letter of credit facility (the “LC Facility”) under which Bank of America, N.A., has agreed to administer the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf. The LC Facility requires us to maintain deposits of cash or other approved investments in amounts that approximate our outstanding letters of credit and contains customary restrictive covenants. In addition, our wholly owned subsidiary, Xcerra, has arrangements with various financial institutions for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees. As of September 28, 2019, $1.3 million was outstanding under standby letters of credit and bank guarantees. 

We expect that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and we anticipate that present working capital will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. 

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 




Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Investment and Interest Rate Risk. 

At September 28, 2019, our investment portfolio included short-term fixed-income investment securities with a fair value of approximately $0.6 million. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will likely decline in value if interest rates increase. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. As we classify our short-term securities as available-for-sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Due to the relatively short duration of our investment portfolio, an immediate ten percent change in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 

We evaluate our investments periodically for possible other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value. As of September 28, 2019, we held no investments with loss positions. 

Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and immaterial fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. As of September 28, 2019, we have approximately $346.5 million of long-term debt due under a Credit Facility that is subject to quarterly interest payments that are based on either a base rate plus a margin of up to 2.0% per annum, or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin of up to 3.0% per annum. The selection of the interest rate formula is at our discretion. The interest rate otherwise payable under the Credit Facility will be subject to increase by 2.0% per annum during the continuance of a payment default and may be subject to increase by 2.0% per annum with respect to the overdue principal amount of any loans outstanding and overdue interest payments and other overdue fees and amounts. At September 28, 2019, the interest rate in effect on these borrowings was 5.29%. 


Table of Contents  

In July 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. After 2021, it is unclear whether banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, and no consensus currently exists as to what benchmark rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee that has been convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. We cannot currently predict the effect of the discontinuation of, or other changes to, LIBOR or any establishment of alternative reference rates in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere on the global capital markets. The uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR, as well as the transition from LIBOR to any alternative reference rate or rates, could have adverse impacts on floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments that currently use LIBOR as a benchmark rate. Our Term B Loan facility constitutes our most significant exposure to this transition and there is no guarantee that a shift from LIBOR to a new reference rate will not result in increases to our borrowing costs. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. 

We have operations in several foreign countries and conduct business in the local currency in these countries. As a result, we have risk associated with currency fluctuations as the value of foreign currencies fluctuate against the U.S. dollar, in particular the Swiss Franc, Euro, Malaysian Ringgit, Chinese Yuan, Philippine Peso and Japanese Yen. These fluctuations can impact our reported earnings. 

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates also impact the U.S. Dollar amount of our net investment in foreign operations. The assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at an average exchange rate during the period which approximates the rates in effect at the transaction dates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. As a result of fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. Dollar as of September 28, 2019, compared to December 29, 2018, our stockholders’ equity decreased by $14.9 million. 

Based upon the current levels of net foreign assets, a hypothetical 10% devaluation of the U.S. Dollar as compared to these currencies as of September 28, 2019 would result in an approximate $37.7 million positive translation adjustment recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. Conversely, a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar as compared to these currencies as of September 28, 2019 would result in an approximate $37.7 million negative translation adjustment recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 


It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Part II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

The information set forth above under Note 11 contained in the "Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 



Cohu acquired Xcerra Corporation (“Xcerra”) on October 1, 2018, at which time Xcerra became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cohu (the “Merger”). Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Xcerra, which is expected to be a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively or delayed, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 


●   

difficulties entering new markets or manufacturing in new geographies where Cohu has no or limited direct prior experience;    

●   

such a new market for Cohu, the automated test equipment market, is intensely competitive with entrenched large competitors who are much larger than Cohu;    

●   

successfully managing relationships with Cohu and Xcerra’s combined supplier and customer base;    

●   

coordinating and integrating independent research and development and engineering teams across technologies and product platforms to enhance product development while reducing costs;    

●   

coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position the combined company’s capabilities and the direction of product development;    

●   

difficulties and significant costs in integrating the systems and processes of two companies with complex operations including multiple manufacturing sites;    

●   

difficulties and potential loss of sales in transitioning customers from certain Xcerra products that are being discontinued and to Cohu products;    

●   

product manufacturing disruptions and delays as we consolidate certain manufacturing sites;    

●   

difficulties and errors that may occur in integrating disparate accounting staffs, processes and systems;    

●   

the increased scale and complexity of Cohu’s operations resulting from the Merger;    

●   

Cohu’s ability to achieve the targeted cost synergies within the expected time frame, and significant costs of integration and restructuring;    

●   

retaining key employees of Cohu and Xcerra;    

●   

obligations that Cohu will have to counterparties of Xcerra that arise as a result of the change in control of Xcerra;    

●   

legal impediments, delays and significant costs to reduce headcounts in various geographies;    

●   

the impact of litigation and potential liabilities we may be inheriting from Xcerra; and    

●   

diversion of management’s attention to integration matters.    

Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and result in us becoming subject to litigation. In addition, even if Xcerra is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. All of these factors could cause reductions in our earnings per share and decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Merger. As a result, it cannot be assured that the Merger will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits. 


Table of Contents  

We have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs in connection with the Merger that could adversely affect our results of operations. 

Although we have completed the Merger, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with the Merger, including restructuring expenses and the payment of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and related financing transactions. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process, and restructuring charges may significantly exceed original estimates. For example, a significant portion of planned cost synergies relate to headcount reductions, primarily in foreign jurisdictions where the labor laws are complex. Any delays in implementing such headcount reductions, or increased costs to implement, would materially impact the cost synergies achieved. These could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. Furthermore, we expect to incur material restructuring and integration charges in connection with the Merger, which may adversely affect our operating results in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. Cohu incurred $9.8 million and $0.4 million of acquisition-related costs, and $37.8 million and $10.7 million of restructuring charges, for the Xcerra acquisition during fiscal year 2018 and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively. 


The business and financial performance of Xcerra are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. We may not be able to maintain the growth rate, levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency that we and Xcerra have achieved or might achieve separately and, in fact, due to weak market conditions in 2019 Xcerra’s sales and earnings have declined significantly on a year-over-year basis. In addition, we believe Xcerra’s ATE products have been materially impacted by the Huawei export restrictions (see risk factor entitled “Global economic and political conditions, including trade tariffs and export restrictions, have impacted our business and may continue to have an impact on our business and financial condition”). Any further underperformance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Cohu’s ability to utilize Xcerra’s net operating loss and credit carryforwards is severely limited. 

As a result of the Merger an ownership change has occurred at Xcerra and as a consequence Cohu’s ability to utilize Xcerra’s net operating loss and credit carryforwards, that were already partially limited due to a prior acquisition, will be subject to annual limitations as provided for in Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383. These annual limitations will result in the inability of Cohu to utilize a substantial portion of these carryforwards. 

Uncertainties underlie Cohu’s expectation that, relative to Cohu on a stand-alone basis, the Merger will be accretive to Cohu’s earnings per share. 

Cohu believes that, relative to Cohu on a stand-alone basis, the Merger will be accretive to Cohu’s earnings per share upon completion of the ongoing restructuring and integration. However, Cohu cannot give any assurance that the Merger will actually be accretive to Cohu’s earnings per share. In addition to the uncertainties that underlie any financial forecast, Cohu will account for the Merger as an acquisition under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, “Business Combinations,” or “ASC 805”. The total cost of the Merger will be allocated to the underlying identifiable net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their respective estimated fair values. Until these allocations are completed, Cohu can only estimate the allocation of the acquisition price to the net assets acquired and the effect of the allocation on future results. That estimate could materially change. 

The use of cash and incurrence of substantial indebtedness in connection with the financing of the Merger may have an adverse impact on Cohu’s liquidity, limit Cohu’s flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase Cohu’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions. 

The Merger was financed in part by using Cohu’s and Xcerra’s cash on hand and the incurrence of indebtedness. In connection with the Merger, Cohu entered into a term loan facility, with an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million (the “Debt Financing” or “Credit Agreement”). Cohu used $160.5 million of Cohu’s and Xcerra’s cash on hand to complete the Merger. Cohu’s (including Xcerra’s) cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 28, 2019 were approximately $145.7 million. The use of cash on hand and indebtedness to finance the acquisition has reduced Cohu’s liquidity and could cause Cohu to place more reliance on cash generated from operations to pay principal and interest on Cohu’s debt, thereby reducing the availability of Cohu’s cash flow for working capital, dividend and capital expenditure needs or to pursue other potential strategic plans.

Our ability to comply with covenants contained in such debt agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Even if we are able to comply with all of the applicable covenants, the restrictions on our ability to manage our business in our sole discretion could adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that we believe would be beneficial to us. In addition, our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, on a first-priority basis, and such security interests could be enforced in the event of default by the collateral agent for the Credit Agreement. 

Cohu has total consolidated long-term debt of $345 and because of such high debt levels we may not be able to service its debt obligations in accordance with their terms; the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act severely limits the deductibility of interest expense. 

Cohu’s ability to meet its expense and debt service obligations contained in the Debt Financing agreements will depend on Cohu’s future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in industry conditions, industry supply and demand balance, customer preferences, the success of Cohu’s products and pressure from competitors. In addition, Cohu is subject to interest rate risks, and continuing increases in interest rates will increase Cohu’s debt service obligations. Should combined Cohu and Xcerra revenues decline after the Merger (as compared to last year), as they did year-to-date 2019 and are again forecasted to do so in fourth quarter 2019, Cohu may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay its debt service obligations when due. If Cohu is unable to meet its debt service obligations after the Merger or should Cohu fail to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements governing its indebtedness, Cohu may be required to refinance all or part of its debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices, incur additional indebtedness or issue Cohu Common Stock or other equity securities. Cohu may not be able to, at any given time, refinance its debt, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness or issue equity securities on terms acceptable to Cohu, in amounts sufficient to meet Cohu’s needs or at all. If Cohu is able to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, such issuance would also result in dilution to Cohu’s stockholders. Cohu’s inability to service its debt obligations or refinance its debt could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial conditions or operating results after the Merger. In addition, Cohu’s debt obligations may limit its ability to make required investments in capacity, technology or other areas of its business, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial conditions or operating results. Furthermore, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act limits the deductibility of interest expense in a given year to 30% of adjusted taxable income, as defined. This resulted in the inability of Cohu to utilize a substantial portion of its interest expense deductions in 2018 and may impact our ability to utilize future deductions. However, the Act permits indefinite carryforward of any disallowed business interest, subject to Internal Revenue Code section 382 limitations on utilization.

The issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with the Merger, and any future offerings of securities by us, will dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in the company. 

The Merger was financed in part by the issuance of additional shares of our common stock to shareholders of Xcerra, comprised approximately 11.8 million shares of common stock, or approximately 29% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock immediately after completing the Merger. These issuances of additional shares of our common stock have diluted shareholders’ ownership interest in our company, and shareholders now have a proportionately reduced ownership and voting interest in our company as a result of completion of the Merger. 

Because a significant portion of Cohu’s total assets will be represented by goodwill, which is subject to mandatory impairment evaluation, and other intangibles, Cohu could be required to write-off some or all of this goodwill and other intangibles, which may adversely affect the combined company’s financial condition and results of operations. 

Cohu has accounted for the acquisition of Xcerra using the purchase method of accounting. A portion of the purchase price for this business was allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on estimated fair values at the date of consummation of the merger. As a result of the Merger, 48.4% of Cohu’s total assets are comprised of goodwill and other intangibles, of which approximately $235.9 million is allocated to goodwill. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other, goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. All other intangible assets are subject to periodic amortization. Cohu evaluates the remaining useful lives of other intangibles each quarter to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, when Cohu performs future impairment tests, it is possible that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets could exceed their implied fair value and therefore would require adjustment. Such adjustment would result in a charge to operating income in that period. Once adjusted, there can be no assurance that there will not be further adjustments for impairment in future periods. 

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting. 

We are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. 

Completing the Merger has significantly increased the size, number of employees, global operations and complexity of Cohu’s business. Although we believe that we have adequate internal controls in place at this time, we cannot be certain that, with significantly greater global complexity, we will be able to maintain adequate internal control over our financial reporting in future periods. Any failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq Global Select Market, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. 


Cohu may discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with Xcerra that were not identified in advance.    

We may discover liabilities, product return issues or deficiencies associated with Xcerra that were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs, including potential accounting and tax charges. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are ultimately dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by Xcerra, as well as the limited amount of time in which the acquisition was executed. For example, since closing the Merger, we have incurred material product returns and associated expenses and were required to make material customer pricing concessions in order to resolve various Xcerra product issues. Any further unexpected liabilities, product return issues or deficiencies associated with Xcerra could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Cohu cannot provide assurance that it will be able to continue paying dividends at the current rate or at all.    


●   

as a result of the Merger and the issuance of shares of Cohu Common Stock in connection with the Merger, the total amount of cash required for Cohu to pay dividends at its current rate has increased;    

●   

Cohu’s credit agreement restricts payments of dividends under certain circumstances;    

●   

Cohu may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to Cohu’s operational cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flow or financial position;    

●   

rising interest rates, which increase Cohu’s debt service obligations;    

●   

Cohu may desire to retain cash to maintain or improve its credit ratings;    

●   

difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;    

●   

given weak market conditions that began in late 2018 and continuing to persist in 2019, and the associated business uncertainty, we may determine to take action to preserve cash;    

●   

Cohu may reduce or eliminate its dividend in order to pay down debt;    

●   

decisions on whether, when and in which amounts to make any future distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of the Cohu Board, which reserves the right to change Cohu’s dividend practices at any time with no prior notice; and    

●   

the amount of dividends that Cohu’s subsidiaries may distribute to Cohu may be subject to restrictions imposed by state or foreign law, restrictions that may be imposed by state or foreign regulators, and restrictions imposed by the terms of any current or future indebtedness that these subsidiaries may incur.    


The Xcerra division has relied on Spirox Corporation (“Spirox”) as its primary distribution channel for sales and service in China and Taiwan for its Semiconductor Test Solutions products, a region that represents a material portion of Xcerra’s revenues. Spirox has had direct contact with Xcerra’s customers, and Spirox has been obligated to satisfy all installation and service obligations for the Semiconductor Test Solutions products. After a thorough review of this arrangement, on October 12, 2018, we notified Spirox of our intention to terminate the Spirox distribution agreement, and subsequently negotiated an accelerated wind-down and termination date of March 12, 2019. Our business and financial performance within the China and Taiwan region may be negatively impacted if cooperation with Spirox during the transition fails, if Cohu is delayed and otherwise fails to timely and adequately staff and fund sales and service resources in the region to replace those resources that have previously been provided by Spirox, or if customers delay or fail, for any reason, to transition to direct sales with us. 



●   

difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;    

●   

increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our business;    

●   

the cost and risk of having to potentially develop new and unfamiliar sales channels for acquired businesses;    

●   

diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;    

●   

the potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of Cohu or acquired businesses;    

●   

lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;    

●   

potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;    

●   

failure to commercialize purchased technology;    

●   

the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods; and    

●   

challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences.    

We may decide to finance future acquisitions and investments through a combination of borrowings, proceeds from equity or debt offerings and the use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. If we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock. 


Table of Contents  

Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. At September 28, 2019, we had goodwill and net purchased intangible assets balances of $235.9 million and $282.5 million, respectively. 

Further, as a strategy to pay down long-term debt, we expect to continue to evaluate divestitures of assets that management determines to be non-core to our overall business strategy. Any such divestitures may distract Cohu’s management team, disrupt employees, may not yield attractive valuations, may incur material restructuring and transaction expenses and tax obligations, and may otherwise be unsuccessful. 

We are making investments in new products to enter new markets, which may adversely affect our operating results; these investments may not be successful. 

Given the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology environment in which we operate, we believe it is important to develop new product offerings to meet strategic opportunities as they evolve. This includes developing products that we believe are necessary to meet the future needs of the marketplace. We are currently investing in new product development programs to enable us to compete in the test contactor markets, while also investing in next generation test handlers and automated test equipment. We expect to continue to make investments and we may at any time, based on product need or marketplace demand, decide to significantly increase our product development expenditures in these or other products. The cost of investments in new product offerings can have a negative impact on our operating results. For example, our PANTHER wafer level package probe system has incurred significant development costs, but has not generated material revenues for us. There can be no assurance that new products we develop will be accepted in the marketplace or generate material revenues for us. 

We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business. 


●   

costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;    

●   

legislative or regulatory requirements and potential changes in or interpretations of requirements in the United States and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;    

●   

trade restrictions, including treaty changes, sanctions and the suspension of export licenses;    

●   


●   

complex labor laws and privacy regulations;    

●   

difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;    

●   

longer payment cycles;    

●   

local political and economic conditions;    

●   

complex tax laws and potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of “double taxation;” and    

●   

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar, which can affect demand for our products and increase our costs.    

Additionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology, inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. 

We have manufacturing operations in Asia. Any failure to effectively manage multiple manufacturing sites and to secure raw materials meeting our quality, cost and other requirements, or failures by our suppliers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation. 

Our reliance on overseas manufacturers exposes us to significant risks including complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax and economic risks, which we may not be able to address quickly and adequately. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify overseas supplier relationships. If we should fail to effectively manage overseas manufacturing operations, or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of overseas manufacturing locations increases the demands on our administrative and operations infrastructure and the complexity of our supply chain management. If our overseas manufacturing locations are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements in a timely manner, our ability to ship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected. 


Table of Contents  

Our suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their business. They may also be impacted by possible import, export, tariff and other trade barriers, increasing costs of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our own business and financial condition. 

Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations. 

We use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts, components and subassemblies. As a result, many key parts may be available only from a single supplier (“sole source”) or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may significantly raise prices or cease manufacturing certain components (with or without advance notice to us) that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain key or sole source suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. 


Visibility into our markets is limited. The semiconductor equipment business is highly dependent on the overall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry has been seasonal with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry’s demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will also be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or net realizable value inventory write-offs and reserve requirements. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges of approximately $1.4 million, $1.1 million, and $1.1 million, respectively, primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts. More recently, in the second half of 2018 and continuing throughout 2019, we have seen significantly weakened demand in automotive, mobility and consumer market segments, and overall geographic weakness in China and Taiwan. These trends adversely affected our second half 2018 results, year-to-date 2019 results, and are expected to continue to adversely impact our full year 2019 outlook and results. Such adverse trends have materially impacted all of our business areas, including the businesses conducted by Xcerra. Finally, in 2018 we incurred $19.1 million of inventory charges related to the decision to end manufacturing of certain of Xcerra’s semiconductor test handler products, and these charges may be insufficient as market conditions and demand changes. 

Due to the nature of our business, we need continued access to capital, which if not available to us or if not available on favorable terms, could harm our ability to operate or expand our business.  

Our business requires capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors when our business is expanding. If cash from available sources is insufficient or cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated. 

We believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. In the event we are required, or elect, to raise additional funds, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all, and may incur expenses in raising the additional funds and increase our interest rate exposure, and any future indebtedness could adversely affect our operating results and severely limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry. Further, under our Credit Agreement, we are significantly limited by financial and other negative covenants in our credit arrangements, including limitations on our borrowing of additional funds and issuing dividends. If we choose to issue new equity securities, existing stockholders may experience dilution, or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. Any inability to raise additional capital when required could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.

The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has several participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers. Some of our competitors are part of larger corporations that have substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities and provide more extensive product offerings. In addition, there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. Intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future. 

We have increased investments in our test contactor business, and announced significant growth targets for the business over the next several years, but due to ongoing weak market conditions we have not achieved our growth goals in 2019, year-to-date. The test contactor market is fragmented, with many entrenched regional players, and subject to intense price competition and high customer support requirements. We believe that customer support and responsiveness and an ability to consistently meet tight deadlines is critical to our success. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our test contactor products, while also meeting customer support requirements and deadlines, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future. 

In addition, with the Xcerra acquisition, Cohu has entered the automated test equipment (“ATE”) market. Our ability to increase our ATE sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from new customers. Semiconductor and electronics manufacturers typically select a particular vendor’s product for testing new generations of a device and make substantial investments to develop related test program applications and interfaces. Once a manufacturer has selected an ATE vendor for a new generation of a device, that manufacturer is more likely to purchase systems from that vendor for that generation of the device, and, possibly, subsequent generations of that device as well. Further, Cohu has a niche position and relatively low share in the ATE market, and this market is primarily driven by two larger companies with significantly more resources to invest into the ATE market. Therefore, the opportunities to obtain orders from new customers or existing customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow our ATE revenue. In fact, as market conditions have weakened, we have seen a material reduction in sales within our ATE business. 

Semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties.  


The design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integration of the equipment with other suppliers’ equipment and the customers’ manufacturing processes, transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industry’s constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductor equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and final manufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of these changes and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of handling, ATE, MEMS, system-level and burn-in test equipment and test contactors is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard test products that can achieve broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industry’s future equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations. 


Table of Contents  

The transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, after sale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our established products. Future technologies, processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products. 

Global economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict. 

Our operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending. Continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, if the current market conditions deteriorate, we may experience increased collection times and greater write-offs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow. 

In addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit may make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. Delays in our customers’ ability to obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing would adversely affect our product sales and revenues and therefore harm our business and operating results. Possible import, export, tariff and other trade barriers, which could be imposed by Asia, the United States, other countries or the European Union might also have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We cannot predict the timing, duration of or effect on our business of an economic slowdown or the timing or strength of a subsequent recovery. 

A limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales.  

A small number of customers have been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. During the past five years, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant customers has varied greatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers’ business, consolidation within the semiconductor industry and their purchase of products from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor equipment industry for customers to purchase products from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers. Furthermore, we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions including end market demand for our customers’ products, outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to cause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results. 

If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer.  

The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our sales and results of operations. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. To address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problems and appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our profits. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operating results. 


The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes rapid changes in demand for its products. These are generally dictated by introduction of new consumer products, launch of new model vehicles, implementation of new communications infrastructure, or in response to an increase in industrial equipment and machinery that utilizes semiconductors. A number of other factors including changes in integrated circuit design and packaging may affect demand for our products. Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipment commonly occur, and have a significant impact on our operations. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce. The volatility in headcount and business levels, combined with the seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may not be able to successfully adjust our systems, facilities and production capacity to meet our customers’ changing requirements. The inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. For example, in the second half of 2018 and throughout 2019, we have seen significant weakening demand in automotive, mobility and consumer market segments, and overall geographic weakness in China and Taiwan. These trends adversely affected our second half 2018 results, year-to-date 2019 results, and are expected to continue to adversely impact our full year 2019 outlook and results as well.

The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business. 

Certain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical, engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel, particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego and Bay Area, California, Boston, Massachusetts, Rosenheim and Kolbermoor, Germany, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland and Osaka, Japan areas, where the majority of our engineering personnel are located, is high and we have had difficulty in recruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees. 

Third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights. 

We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patent life, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time-to-time, we receive notices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

A majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asian equipment suppliers. 

The majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularly in Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages over United States (“U.S.”) suppliers, including us. These advantages include, among other things, proximity to customers, lower cost structures, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asia could impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers. 

Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, enactment of new tax laws, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.

Compliance with regulations may impact sales to foreign customers and impose costs. 

Certain products and services that we offer require compliance with U.S. and other foreign country export and other regulations. Compliance with complex U.S. and other foreign country laws and regulations that apply to our international sales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and U.S. and other foreign country laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or that our policies will be effective in preventing all potential violations. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims of violations of these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. 

In addition to government regulations regarding sale and export, we are subject to other regulations regarding our products. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements if the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These new rules and verification requirements will impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the cost of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers that could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. 

There may be changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and governmental policy in the United States. 

The change in administration in the United States has resulted and may continue to result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals that could have a material impact on us include, but are not limited to, infrastructure renewal programs; and modifications to international trade policy, such as approvals by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States; increased duties, tariffs or other restrictions; public company reporting requirements; environmental regulation and antitrust enforcement. 


In the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, 87% of our revenue was from products shipped to customer locations outside the United States. We also purchase a significant portion of components and subassemblies from suppliers outside the United States. Additionally, a significant portion of our facilities are located outside the United States, including Malaysia, Germany, China and Japan. 

The United States and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. General trade tensions between the U.S. and China have been escalating since 2018, with U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods. Higher duties on existing tariffs and further rounds of tariffs have been announced or repeatedly threatened by U.S. and Chinese leaders. Additionally, the U.S. has threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from other countries, which could also impact our or certain of our customers' operations. If the U.S. were to impose current or additional tariffs on components that we or our suppliers source, our cost for such components would increase. We may also incur increases in manufacturing costs and supply chain risks due to our efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and our operations. Tariffs on our customers' products could also impact their sales of such end products, resulting in lower demand for our products.

Furthermore, On May 16, 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security ("BIS") of the U.S. Department of Commerce added Huawei to the BIS's Entity List, which imposes limitations on the supply of certain U.S. items and product support to Huawei. Although our sales to Huawei are immaterial, to ensure compliance with the Entity List restrictions, we suspended shipments of all products to Huawei, effective May 16, 2019. We then reviewed our product portfolio to determine whether our products and related support are subject to the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"), and therefore within the scope of the Entity List restrictions. We have determined that certain products Huawei purchases from us are not subject to the EAR and consequently can be lawfully sold and shipped to Huawei. Accordingly, we have recently resumed shipping certain products to Huawei. 

While Huawei remains on the Entity List, and in the absence of a license from the BIS, we may be unable to work with Huawei on future product development, which may have a negative effect on our ability to sell products to Huawei in the future. Entity List restrictions may also encourage Huawei to seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, thereby decreasing our long-term competitiveness as a supplier to Huawei. More broadly, other China-based companies, unrelated to Huawei, may also seek alternative non-U.S. product sources driven by the ongoing unpredictability of U.S.-China trade relations. 


Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches.  


Our global Enterprise Resource Management (“ERP”) upgrade may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. 

We are in development stage for the global replacement of our existing ERP solution. The new solution is being developed as an enterprise solution in partnership with a leading provider of ERP tools. Additional investments in enterprise tools that focus on product life-cycle management, our customer experience, and supply chain management are in process to support our growing business. These implementations are extremely complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on software and implementation activities. If we do not effectively implement the system or if the system does not operate as intended, it could result in the loss or corruption of data, delayed order processing and shipments and increased costs. It could also adversely affect our financial reporting systems and our ability to produce financial reports and process transactions, the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The occurrence of natural disasters and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales. 

Our corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, our Asian sales and service headquarters is located in Singapore and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have Asia-based manufacturing plants in Malaysia, Philippines and Japan. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires and floods, and geopolitical risks, which at times have disrupted the local economies. For example, a significant earthquake or tsunami could materially affect operating results. We are not insured for most losses and business interruptions of this kind, or for geopolitical or terrorism impacts, and presently have limited redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would materially suffer. 



  ●   seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of the semiconductor equipment industry;    

  ●   timing and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;    

  ●   customer decisions to cancel orders or push out deliveries;    

  ●   inability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;    

  ●   inventory writedowns;    

  ●   unexpected expenses or cost overruns in the introduction and support of products;    

  ●   inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers; and    

  ●   intangible and deferred tax asset writedowns.    

Due to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time-to-time our quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly. 



We have experienced significant volatility in our stock price. 

A variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, including ours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the three-year period ended September 28, 2019, the price of our common stock has ranged from $27.83 to $10.72. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable, volatile and seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test handler industry, our limited backlog and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance.
