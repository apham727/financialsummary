Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Organization  

Seagate Technology plc (the Company) is a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions. Its principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, the Company produces a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSDs) and storage subsystems.  

Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, and most SSDs use NAND flash memory.  

The Companys HDD products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems; edge compute applications, where its products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing; and edge non-compute applications, where its products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as portable external storage systems, surveillance systems, digital video recorders (DVRs), network-attached storage (NAS), and gaming consoles. The Companys SSD products mainly include serial attached SCSI (SAS) and Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) SSDs.  

The Companys enterprise data solutions (formerly referred to as the cloud systems and solutions) portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturers (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.  

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation  

The Companys unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.  

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The methods, estimates and judgments the Company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the Company reports in its condensed consolidated financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareholders equity for the periods presented. Such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature.  

The Companys consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2018, are included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 3, 2018. The Company believes that the disclosures included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, when read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements as of June 29, 2018, and the notes thereto, are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  

The results of operations for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for any subsequent interim period or for the Companys fiscal year ending June 28, 2019. The Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal year of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to June 30. Both the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018 consisted of 13 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively. Fiscal year 2019, which ends on June 28, 2019, and fiscal year 2018, which ended on June 29, 2018, are both comprised of 52 weeks. The fiscal quarters ended March 29, 2019, December 28, 2018, September 28, 2018, and March 30, 2018, are also referred to herein as the March 2019 quarter, the December 2018 quarter, the September 2018 quarter and the March 2018 quarter, respectively.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Except for the change in the Companys revenue recognition policy described below, there have been no material changes to the Companys significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Part II, Item 8 of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2018, as filed with the SEC on August 3, 2018.  

Revenue Recognition  


Revenue from sales of products is generally recognized upon transfer of control to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products, net of sales taxes. This typically occurs upon shipment from the Company. When applicable, the Company includes shipping charges billed to customers in Revenue and includes the related shipping costs in Cost of revenue on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  

The Company records estimated variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition as a reduction to net revenue. Variable consideration generally consists of sales incentive programs, such as price protection and volume incentives aimed at increasing customer demand. For OEM sales, rebates are typically established by estimating the most likely amount of consideration expected to be received based on an OEM customers volume of purchases from Seagate or other agreed upon rebate programs. For the distribution and retailing channel, these sales incentive programs typically involve estimating the most likely amount of rebates related to a customers level of sales, order size, advertising or point of sale activity as well as the expected value of price protection adjustments based on historical analysis and forecasted pricing environment. Marketing development program costs are accrued and recorded as a reduction to revenue at the same time that the related revenue is recognized.  

The Company elected a practical expedient to expense sales commissions when the commissions are incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded as Marketing and administrative on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

In February 2016 and July 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-02 (ASC Topic 842), Leases ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, and Leases, ASU 2018-11, Leases (ASC Topic 842), Target Improvements, respectively. These ASUs amend a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize operating leases with a term greater than one year on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments. The Company plans to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of these ASUs on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  



Table of Contents 


In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 (ASC Subtopic 350-40), Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software - Customers Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract. This ASU aligns the accounting for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the accounting for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 (ASC Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and FASB also issued certain interpretive clarifications on this new guidance which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes the revenue recognition guidance under ASC 605. It also requires entities to disclose both quantitative and qualitative information that enable financial statements users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This ASU became effective and was adopted by the Company in the September 2018 quarter retrospectively with a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit at the date of adoption (modified retrospective transition approach). The Company has completed the adoption and implemented policies, processes and controls to support the new standards measurement and disclosure requirements.  



The impact of applying the new accounting standard on the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 was not material.

Investment in Debt Security  

As of March 29, 2019 and June 29, 2018, the Company had approximately $1.3 billion investment in non-convertible preferred stock of Toshiba Memory Corporation (TMC, formerly known as K.K. Pangea). The Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity. As such, the investment, with a contractual maturity of six years starting from May 31, 2018, is accounted for as a held-to-maturity debt security, carried at cost and adjusted for amortization of transaction costs into interest income. Additionally, the debt security has a contractual payment-in-kind (PIK) income which will be paid in cash upon redemption of the investment. PIK income computed at the contractual rate is accrued into Interest income in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and added to the carrying value of the Investment in debt security on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, the PIK income earned was $16 million and $47 million, respectively. There was no other-than-temporary impairment identified for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019. Please refer to Note 8 - Fair Value for more details.

Debt  

Revolving Credit Facility  

On February 20, 2019, the Company terminated its senior unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire on January 15, 2020, under which the Company was able to draw up to $700 million. Upon termination, the Company and its subsidiary Seagate HDD Cayman entered into a new credit agreement (the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility) which provides the Company with a $1.3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The term of the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility is through February 20, 2024. The loans made under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a variable margin that will be determined based on the corporate credit rating of the Company. The Company and certain other material subsidiaries of the Company fully and unconditionally guarantee the revolving credit facility. The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility also allows the Company to increase the facility by up to an aggregate of $300 million, provided that (i) there has been, and will be after giving effect to such increase, no default, (ii) the increase is at least $25 million, and (iii) the existing commitments under the facility receive 0.50% most favored nation protection. An aggregate amount of up to $75 million of the facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit, and an aggregate amount of up to $50 million of the facility is also available for swing line loans.  


As of March 29, 2019, $200 million had been drawn and no letters of credit or swing line loans had been utilized under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.  

Long-Term Debt  

$800 million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.75% Senior Notes due November 2018 (the 2018 Notes). The Company recorded a loss of approximately $1 million and $3 million on repurchases during the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, respectively, which is included in Other, net on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. On November 15, 2018, the 2018 Notes matured and the Company repaid the entire outstanding principal amount of $499 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  

$750 million Aggregate Principal Amount of 4.25% Senior Notes due March 2022 (the 2022 Notes). The interest on the 2022 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The issuer under the 2022 Notes is Seagate HDD Cayman, and the obligations under the 2022 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by the Company.  

$1 billion Aggregate Principal Amount of 4.75% Senior Notes due June 2023 (the 2023 Notes). The interest on the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The issuer under the 2023 Notes is Seagate HDD Cayman, and the obligations under the 2023 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by the Company.  

$500 million Aggregate Principal Amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due March 2024 (the 2024 Notes). The interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The issuer under the 2024 Notes is Seagate HDD Cayman, and the obligations under the 2024 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by the Company.  

$1 billion Aggregate Principal Amount of 4.75% Senior Notes due January 2025 (the 2025 Notes). The interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually on January 1 and July 1 of each year. The issuer under the 2025 Notes is Seagate HDD Cayman, and the obligations under the 2025 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by the Company.  

$700 million Aggregate Principal Amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due June 2027 (the 2027 Notes). The interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The issuer under the 2027 Notes is Seagate HDD Cayman, and the obligations under the 2027 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by the Company.  


Table of Contents 

$500 million Aggregate Principal Amount of 5.75% Senior Notes due December 2034 (the 2034 Notes). The interest on the 2034 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The issuer under the 2034 Notes is Seagate HDD Cayman, and the obligations under the 2034 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by the Company.  




Income Taxes  

The Company recorded income tax provisions of $20 million and $52 million in the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, respectively. The income tax provision for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 included approximately $9 million and $5 million of net discrete tax expense, respectively, primarily associated with a deferred withholding tax liability resulting from a change in indefinite reinvestment assertion for a foreign subsidiary. This was partially offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.  

The Companys income tax provision recorded for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the Irish statutory rate of 25% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) tax benefits related to non-U.S. earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Ireland and (ii) a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets.  

During the nine months ended March 29, 2019, the Companys unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties decreased by approximately $19 million to $41 million. The unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate were $41 million at March 29, 2019, subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals. During the twelve months beginning March 30, 2019, the Company expects that its unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by approximately $6 million, primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.  

The Company recorded income tax provisions of $12 million and $231 million in the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, respectively. The income tax provision for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018 included approximately $2 million of net discrete tax benefit and approximately $195 million of net discrete expense, respectively. The discrete items for the nine months ended March 30, 2018 are primarily associated with the revaluation of U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017, partially offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.  

The Companys income tax provision recorded for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the Irish statutory rate of 25% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) tax benefits related to non-U.S. earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Ireland and (ii) a reduction in the net U.S. deferred tax assets associated with revaluation to a lower U.S. tax rate.  


Table of Contents 

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law in the United States. The Tax Act significantly revises U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, lowering U.S. corporate income tax rates from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.  

The U.S. tax law changes, including limitations on various business deductions such as executive compensation under Internal Revenue Code §162(m), will not impact the Companys tax expense in the short-term due to its large net operating loss and tax credit carryovers and associated valuation allowance. The Tax Acts new international rules, including Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI), Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII), and Base Erosion Anti-Avoidance Tax (BEAT) are effective beginning in fiscal year 2019. For fiscal year 2019, the Company has included these effects of the Tax Act in its fiscal year 2019 financial statements and has concluded the impact will not be material.  

As of the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2018, pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 (regarding the application of ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740) associated with the enactment of the Tax Act), the Company had considered SAB 118 and believed its accounting under ASC 740 for the provisions of the Tax Act was complete.  


Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

Goodwill  



Other Intangible Assets  

Other intangible assets consist primarily of existing technology, customer relationships and trade names acquired in business combinations. Intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the respective estimated useful lives of the assets. Amortization is charged to Operating expenses in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Restructuring and Exit Costs  

For the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, the Company recorded restructuring charges of approximately $11 million and $39 million, respectively, comprised primarily of charges related to workforce reduction costs and facilities and other exit costs associated with the restructuring of its workforce. The Companys significant restructuring plans are described below. All restructuring charges are reported in Restructuring and other, net on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  

December 2017 Plan  On December 8, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the December 2017 Plan) to reduce its cost structure. The December 2017 Plan included reducing the Companys global headcount by approximately 500 employees. The December 2017 Plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2018.  

July 2017 Plan  On July 25, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the July 2017 Plan) to reduce its cost structure. The July 2017 Plan included reducing the Companys global headcount by approximately 600 employees. The July 2017 Plan was substantially completed during fiscal year 2018.  

March 2017 Plan  On March 9, 2017, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the March 2017 Plan) in connection with the continued consolidation of its global footprint. The Company closed its design center in Korea, resulting in the reduction of the Companys headcount by approximately 300 employees. The March 2017 Plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2017.  

July 2016 Plan  On July 11, 2016, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the July 2016 Plan) for continued consolidation of its global footprint across Asia, EMEA and the Americas. The July 2016 Plan included reducing worldwide headcount by approximately 6,500 employees. The July 2016 Plan was substantially completed during fiscal year 2018.  


Table of Contents 



Additionally, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $2 million on its held for sale land and building for the nine months ended March 29, 2019, which is included in Restructuring and other, net in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company did not record any impairment charge for the three months ended March 29, 2019. Please refer to Note 8 - Fair Value for more details.  


Derivative Financial Instruments  

The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and to a lesser extent, equity market risks relating to its ongoing business operations. From time to time, the Company enters into cash flow hedges in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk on forecasted expenses and investments denominated in foreign currencies. The Companys accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether the instruments are classified as designated or non-designated hedging instruments. The Company records all derivatives in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The changes in the fair value of highly effective designated cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments or are not assessed to be highly effective are adjusted to fair value through earnings. The amount of net unrealized loss on cash flow hedges was less than $1 million as of March 29, 2019 and the amount of net unrealized gain on cash flow hedges was less than $1 million as of June 29, 2018.  

The Company de-designates its cash flow hedges when the forecasted hedged transactions affect earnings or it is probable the forecasted hedged transactions will not occur in the initially identified time period. At such time, the associated gains and losses deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are reclassified immediately into earnings and any subsequent changes in the fair value of such derivative instruments are immediately reflected in earnings. The Company recognized a net loss of $1 million and net gain of $1 million in Other expense, net related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, respectively. The Company did not recognize any net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018.  

Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward exchange contracts that the Company uses to hedge the foreign currency exposure on the investment in debt security and forecasted expenditures denominated in currency other than the U.S. dollar. The Company recognizes gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in Other, net on its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations along with foreign currency gains and losses on investment in debt security, deferred gains of derivatives in Other current assets and deferred losses of derivatives in Accrued expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company is subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by its employees as part of its Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Planthe Seagate Deferred Compensation Plan (the SDCP). In fiscal year 2014, the Company entered into a Total Return Swap (TRS) in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the SDCP liabilities. The Company pays a floating rate, based on LIBOR plus an interest rate spread, on the notional amount of the TRS. The TRS is designed to substantially offset changes in the SDCP liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees. As of March 29, 2019, the notional investments underlying the TRS amounted to $114 million. The contract term of the TRS is through January 2020 and is settled on a monthly basis, therefore limiting counterparty performance risk. The Company does not designate the TRS as a hedge. Rather, the Company records all changes in the fair value of the TRS to earnings to offset the market value changes of the SDCP liabilities.  




Table of Contents 





As of March 30, 2018, the Company had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the gross fair value of the TRS reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet was immaterial.  




Fair Value  

Measurement of Fair Value  

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.  


Table of Contents 

Fair Value Hierarchy  


Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;  

Level 2  Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are inactive; quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; or  

Level 3  Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.  

The Company considers an active market to be one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, and views an inactive market as one in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers. Where appropriate the Companys or the counterpartys non-performance risk is considered in determining the fair values of liabilities and assets, respectively.  

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  




Table of Contents 





The Company classifies items in Level 1 if the financial assets consist of securities for which quoted prices are available in an active market.  


Table of Contents 


As of March 29, 2019 and June 29, 2018, the Company had no Level 3 assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis  

From time to time, the Company enters into certain strategic investments for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These strategic investments primarily include cost basis investments representing those where the Company does have the ability to exercise significant influence but does not have control. These investments are included in Other assets, net in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are periodically analyzed to determine whether or not there are indicators of impairment.  


As of March 29, 2019 and June 29, 2018, the carrying value of the Companys strategic investments were $118 million. For the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, the Company determined that a certain equity investment accounted for under the cost method was other-than-temporarily impaired and recorded a charge of $3 million in order to write down the carrying value of the investment to its fair value. For the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, there were no upward or downward adjustments on equity investments as a result of adoption of the measurement alternative during the September 2018 quarter.  

As of March 29, 2019 and June 29, 2018, the Company had $52 million and $26 million, respectively, of held for sale land and building (collectively, the properties) included in Other current assets on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Of the balance as of March 29, 2019, $24 million and $28 million are located in Asia and in the Americas, respectively. Depreciation related to the properties ceased as of the date these were determined to be held for sale. During the September 2018 quarter, the Company accepted an offer to sell the property in Asia to a third party and thereafter, recorded an impairment charge of approximately $2 million for the nine months ended March 29, 2019. The impairment charge was recorded in Restructuring and other, net in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. No impairment was identified for the three months ended March 29, 2019 and for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018. The sale of the properties are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2019, subject to customary closing conditions for both properties and government approval for the sale of the property in Asia.  

Other Fair Value Disclosures  

The Companys investment in a debt security, classified as held-to-maturity, represents shares of non-convertible preferred stock of TMC. This debt security has a maturity date of six years starting from May 31, 2018 and is classified as Investment in debt security on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt security is recorded at amortized cost and its fair value approximated the carrying value at June 29, 2018. As of March 29, 2019, the fair value of this investment was $1,322 million with an unrealized gain of $4 million on the carrying value of $1,318 million. There was no other-than-temporary impairment identified for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019. The fair value was determined utilizing Level 2 inputs such as discount rates and yield terms of similar types of securities issued by comparable companies.

Equity  

Share Capital  

The Companys authorized share capital is $13,500 and consists of 1,250,000,000 ordinary shares, par value $0.00001, of which 276,834,237 shares were outstanding as of March 29, 2019, and 100,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.00001, of which none were issued or outstanding as of March 29, 2019.  

Ordinary shares  Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by the Companys board of directors (the Board of Directors). Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, after required payments are made to holders of preferred shares, any remaining assets of the Company will be distributed ratably to holders of the preferred and ordinary shares. Holders of shares are entitled to one vote per share on all matters upon which the ordinary shares are entitled to vote, including the election of directors.  

Preferred shares  The Company may issue preferred shares in one or more series, up to the authorized amount, without shareholder approval. The Board of Directors is authorized to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any of its qualifications, limitations or restrictions. The Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by the shareholders.  

The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred shares with voting or conversion rights that could harm the voting power or other rights of the holders of the ordinary shares. The issuance of preferred shares, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company and might harm the market price of its ordinary shares and the voting and other rights of the holders of ordinary shares.  

Repurchases of Equity Securities  

All repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.  

On October 29, 2018, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $2.3 billion of its outstanding ordinary shares. As of March 29, 2019, $2.5 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit.

Guarantees  

Indemnifications of Officers and Directors  

On May 4, 2009, Seagate Technology, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands (Seagate-Cayman), then the parent company, entered into a new form of indemnification agreement (the Revised Indemnification Agreement) with its officers and directors of Seagate-Cayman and its subsidiaries (each, an Indemnitee). The Revised Indemnification Agreement provides indemnification in addition to any of Indemnitees indemnification rights under Seagate-Caymans Articles of Association, applicable law or otherwise, and indemnifies an Indemnitee for certain expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and settlement amounts actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in any action or proceeding, including any action by or in the right of Seagate-Cayman or any of its subsidiaries, arising out of his or her service as a director, officer, employee or agent of Seagate-Cayman or any of its subsidiaries or of any other entity to which he or she provides services at Seagate-Caymans request. However, an Indemnitee shall not be indemnified under the Revised Indemnification Agreement for (i) any fraud or dishonesty in the performance of Indemnitees duty to Seagate-Cayman or the applicable subsidiary of Seagate-Cayman or (ii) Indemnitees conscious, intentional or willful failure to act honestly, lawfully and in good faith with a view to the best interests of Seagate-Cayman or the applicable subsidiary of Seagate-Cayman. In addition, the Revised Indemnification Agreement provides that Seagate-Cayman will advance expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in connection with enforcement of the Revised Indemnification Agreement or with the investigation, settlement or appeal of any action or proceeding against him or her as to which he or she could be indemnified.  


Table of Contents 

On July 3, 2010, pursuant to a corporate reorganization, the common shareholders of Seagate-Cayman became ordinary shareholders of the Company and Seagate-Cayman became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, as described more fully in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on July 6, 2010 (the Redomestication). On July 27, 2010, in connection with the Redomestication, the Company, as sole shareholder of Seagate-Cayman, approved a form of deed of indemnity (the Deed of Indemnity), which provides for the indemnification by Seagate-Cayman of any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, Seagate-Cayman or any subsidiary of the Company (each, a Deed Indemnitee), in addition to any indemnification rights of a Deed Indemnitee under the Companys Articles of Association, applicable law or otherwise, with a similar scope to the Revised Indemnification Agreement. Seagate-Cayman entered into Deeds of Indemnity with certain Deed Indemnitees effective as of July 3, 2010 and continues to enter into Deeds of Indemnity with additional Deed Indemnitees from time to time.  

The nature of these indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay on behalf of its officers and directors. Historically, the Company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations.  

Intellectual Property Indemnification Obligations  

The Company has entered into agreements with customers and suppliers that include limited intellectual property indemnification obligations that are customary in the industry. These guarantees generally require the Company to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising from these transactions. The nature of the intellectual property indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay to its customers and suppliers. Historically, the Company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations.

Earnings Per Share  



The anti-dilutive shares related to employee equity award plans that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share were less than 1 million for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, and approximately 1 million for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018.  


Legal, Environmental and Other Contingencies  

The Company assesses the probability of an unfavorable outcome of all its material litigation, claims, or assessments to determine whether a liability had been incurred and whether it is probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of the loss. In the event that an unfavorable outcome is determined to be probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company establishes an accrual for the litigation, claim or assessment. In addition, in the event an unfavorable outcome is determined to be less than probable, but reasonably possible, the Company will disclose an estimate of the possible loss or range of such loss; however, when a reasonable estimate cannot be made, the Company will provide disclosure to that effect. Litigation is inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions. Additionally, the Company may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially.  

Intellectual Property Litigation  

Convolve, Inc. (Convolve) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) v. Seagate Technology LLC, et al. On July 13, 2000, Convolve and MIT filed suit against Compaq Computer Corporation and Seagate Technology LLC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 4,916,635 (the 635 patent) and U.S. Patent No. 5,638,267 (the 267 patent), misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, and other claims. On January 16, 2002, Convolve filed an amended complaint, alleging defendants were infringing U.S. Patent No. 6,314,473 (the 473 patent). The district court ruled in 2010 that the 267 patent was out of the case.

Lambeth Magnetic Structures LLC v. Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc., et al. On April 29, 2016, Lambeth Magnetic Structures LLC filed a complaint against Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc. and Seagate Technology LLC in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,128,988, Magnetic Material Structures, Devices and Methods. The Company believes the claims asserted in the complaint are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this case. The court issued its claim construction ruling on October 18, 2017. No trial date has been set. While the possible range of loss for this matter remains uncertain, the Company estimates the amount of loss to be immaterial to the financial statements.  

Environmental Matters  

The Companys operations are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Some of the Companys operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities.  

The Company has established environmental management systems and continually updates its environmental policies and standard operating procedures for its operations worldwide. The Company believes that its operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits. The Company budgets for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws. If additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on the Company in the future, it could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures.  

Some environmental laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the Superfund law) and its state equivalents, can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites, regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity. The Company has been identified as a responsible or potentially responsible party at several sites. At each of these sites, the Company has an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties. The Company has fulfilled its responsibilities at some of these sites and remains involved in only a few at this time.  

While the Companys ultimate costs in connection with these sites is difficult to predict with complete accuracy, based on its current estimates of cleanup costs and its expected allocation of these costs, the Company does not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material.  



Table of Contents 

Other Matters  

The Company is involved in a number of other judicial, regulatory or administrative proceedings and investigations incidental to its business, and the Company may be involved in such proceedings and investigations arising in the normal course of its business in the future. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.  


Commitments  

Unconditional Long-term Purchase Obligations  

As of March 29, 2019, the Company had unconditional long-term purchase obligations of approximately $196 million, primarily related to purchase minimum quarterly amounts of inventory components at fixed contractual prices. The Company expects the commitment to total $2 million, $13 million, $8 million, $50 million, $48 million and $75 million for fiscal years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2024, 2025 and thereafter, respectively.  

Unconditional Long-term Capital Expenditures

Our Company  

We are a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions. Our principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, we produce a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSD) and storage subsystems.  

Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, and most SSDs use NAND flash memory.  

Our HDD products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems; edge compute applications, where our products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing; and edge non-compute applications, where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as portable external storage systems, surveillance systems, digital video recorders (DVRs), network-attached storage (NAS) and gaming consoles. Our SSD products mainly include serial attached SCSI (SAS) and Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) SSDs.  

Our enterprise data solutions (formerly referred to as the cloud systems and solutions) portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturer (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.  

Overview of the March 2019 quarter  

During the March 2019 quarter, we shipped 77 exabytes of HDD storage capacity. We generated revenue of approximately $2.3 billion, gross margin of 26% and our operating cash flow was $438 million. We repurchased approximately 7 million of our ordinary shares for $327 million and paid $178 million in dividends. We entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility) and borrowed $200 million from the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.

Results of Operations  




Table of Contents 

Revenue  



Revenue in the March 2019 quarter decreased by $402 million from the December 2018 quarter primarily due to the decrease in exabytes shipped as a result of lower demand for our products, seasonality declines and price erosion.  

Revenue in the March 2019 quarter decreased by $490 million from the March 2018 quarter primarily due to the decrease in exabytes shipped as a result of less favorable market conditions and price erosion.  

Revenue for the nine months ended March 29, 2019 decreased by $330 million from the nine months ended March 30, 2018 primarily due to price erosion, partially offset by an increase in exabytes shipped.  

We maintain various sales incentive programs such as channel rebates and price masking. Sales incentive programs were approximately 13%, 13% and 12% of gross drive revenue for the March 2019, December 2018 and March 2018 quarters, respectively. Adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales incentive programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods were less than 1% of quarterly gross revenue in all periods presented.  

Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin  


Gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the March 2019 quarter decreased from the December 2018 quarter primarily driven by factory underutilization and price erosion.  

Compared to the March 2018 quarter, gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the March 2019 quarter decreased primarily driven by price erosion and factory underutilization.  

Compared to the nine months ended March 29, 2019, gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended March 30, 2018 remained flat primarily driven by favorable product mix offset by price erosion.  

In the March 2019 quarter, total warranty cost was 0.6% of revenue and included a favorable change in estimates of prior warranty accruals of 0.5% of revenue due to improvements in return rates on newer generation products. Warranty cost related to new shipments was 1.1%, 1.1% and 1.3% of revenue for the March 2019, December 2018 and March 2018 quarters, respectively.

Operating Expenses  


Product development expense. Product development expense for the March 2019 quarter decreased by $8 million compared to the December 2018 quarter due to a $7 million decrease in other general expenses mainly as a result of timing of materials purchases, a $4 million decrease in variable compensation expense, offset by a $2 million increase in share-based compensation expense.  

Compared to the March 2018 quarter, Product development expense for the March 2019 quarter decreased by $16 million primarily due to a $10 million decrease in variable compensation expense and an $8 million decrease in other general expenses due to operational efficiencies.  

Compared to the corresponding nine months ended March 30, 2018, Product development expense for the nine months ended March 29, 2019 decreased by $17 million primarily due to an $18 million decrease in variable compensation expense and a $5 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits primarily due to the voluntary early exit program and restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, partially offset by a $9 million increase in share-based compensation expense.  

Marketing and administrative expense. Marketing and administrative expense for the March 2019 quarter decreased by $10 million from the December 2018 quarter, primarily due to a decrease in other general expenses.  

Compared to the March 2018 quarter, Marketing and administrative expense for the March 2019 quarter decreased by $25 million, primarily due to a $4 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, a $13 million decrease in other general expenses and a $7 million decrease in variable compensation expense.  

Compared to the corresponding nine months ended March 30, 2018, Marketing and administrative expense for the nine months ended March 29, 2019 decreased by $77 million, primarily due to a $31 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of the restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, a $30 million decrease in other general expenses due to related operational efficiencies and a $15 million decrease in variable compensation expense.  

Amortization of intangibles. Amortization of intangibles for the March 2019 quarter remained flat compared to the December 2018 quarter and March 2018 quarter. Amortization of intangibles for the nine months ended March 29, 2019 decreased by $30 million from the nine months ended March 30, 2018 due to certain intangible assets reaching the end of their useful lives.  

Restructuring and other, net. Restructuring and other, net for nine months ended March 29, 2019 was comprised of charges primarily related to a voluntary early exit program. There was no new restructuring plan in the March 2019 quarter.  

Restructuring and other, net for nine months ended March 30, 2018 was comprised of restructuring charges to reduce our global workforce by 1,100 employees.  

Other Expense, Net  



Table of Contents 

Other expense, net. Other expense, net for the March 2019 quarter remained flat compared to the December 2018 quarter.  

Compared to the March 2018 quarter, Other expense, net for the March 2019 quarter decreased by $27 million primarily due to a $16 million increase in interest income on our investment in a debt security, a $9 million net increase in gains due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, a $6 million decrease in interest expense due to the repayment of certain senior notes, a $3 million decrease due to impairment charge of a strategic investment that did not recur in fiscal year 2019, offset by a $5 million decrease in interest income primarily due to lower average invested balances.  

Other expense, net for the nine months ended March 29, 2019 decreased by $103 million from the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to a $47 million increase in interest income on our investment in a debt security, a $43 million net increase in gains due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a $14 million decrease in interest expense due to the repayment of certain senior notes.  

Income Taxes  



Table of Contents 

We recorded income tax provisions of $20 million and $52 million in the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, respectively. The income tax provision for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 included approximately $9 million and $5 million of net discrete tax expense, respectively, primarily associated with a deferred withholding tax liability resulting from a change in indefinite reinvestment assertion for a foreign subsidiary. This was partially offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.  

Our income tax provision recorded for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the Irish statutory rate of 25% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) tax benefits related to non-U.S. earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Ireland and (ii) a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets.  

During the nine months ended March 29, 2019, our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties decreased by approximately $19 million to $41 million. The unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate were $41 million at March 29, 2019, subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals. During the 12 months beginning March 30, 2019, we expect that our unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by approximately $6 million, primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.  

Our income tax provision was $12 million and $231 million in the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018, respectively. The income tax provision for the three and nine months ended March 30, 2018 included approximately $2 million of net discrete tax benefit and approximately $195 million of net discrete tax expense, respectively. The discrete items for the nine months ended March 30, 2018 are primarily associated with the revaluation of U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017, partially offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.  

Our income tax provision recorded for the nine months ended March 30, 2018 differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the Irish statutory rate of 25% to income before income taxes, primarily due to the net effect of (i) tax benefits related to non-U.S. earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of Ireland and (ii) a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets.  

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law in the United States. The Tax Act significantly revises U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, lowering U.S. corporate income tax rates from 35% to 21%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.  

The U.S. tax law changes, including limitations on various business deductions such as executive compensation under Internal Revenue Code §162(m), will not impact our tax expense in the short-term due to our large net operating loss and tax credit carryovers and associated valuation allowance. The Tax Acts new international rules, including Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI), Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII), and Base Erosion Anti-Avoidance Tax (BEAT) are effective beginning in fiscal year 2019. For fiscal year 2019, we have included these effects of the Tax Act in our financial statements and concluded the impact will not be material.  

As of the quarter ended September 28, 2018, pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 (regarding the application of ASC 740 associated with the enactment of the Tax Act), we had considered SAB 118 and believed our accounting under ASC 740 for the provisions of the Tax Act was complete.

Cash and Cash Equivalents  


Our cash and cash equivalents as of March 29, 2019 decreased by $465 million from June 29, 2018 primarily as a result of repurchases of our ordinary shares of $613 million, dividends to our shareholders of $539 million, repayment of our 2018 Senior Notes of $499 million, and payments for capital expenditures of $451 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the borrowing on the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility of $196 million and net cash provided by operating activities.

       

a decrease of $296 million in accounts receivable, primarily due to a decrease in revenue and improved collections;

Liquidity Sources, Cash Requirements and Commitments  



Table of Contents 

On February 20, 2019, we terminated our senior unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire on January 15, 2020, under which we were able to draw up to $700 million. Upon termination, we and our subsidiary Seagate HDD Cayman entered into a new credit agreement which provides us with a $1.3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and an option to increase the facility by up to an aggregate of $300 million provided that (i) there has been, and will be after giving effect to such increase, no default, (ii) the increase is at least $25 million, and (iii) the existing commitments under the facility receive 0.50% most favored nation protection.  

As of March 29, 2019, approximately $200 million in borrowings had been drawn and no borrowings had been utilized for letters of credit or swing line loans issued under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility is available for borrowings, subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing.  


Our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital, product development and capital expenditure needs, to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, and to fund our quarterly dividend and any future strategic investments. Our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows, which are determined by future operating performance, and therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.  

For fiscal year 2019, we expect capital expenditures to remain within our long-term targeted range of 6% to 8% of revenue.  

From time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding notes in open market or privately negotiated purchases or otherwise, or we may repurchase outstanding notes pursuant to the terms of the applicable indenture.  

Dividends declared in the March 2019 quarter of $174 million were subsequently paid on April 3, 2019. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.63 per share on April 30, 2019, which is payable on July 3, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 19, 2019.  

From time to time we may repurchase any of our outstanding ordinary shares through private, open market, tender offers broker-assisted purchases or other means. On October 29, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $2.3 billion of its outstanding ordinary shares. As of March 29, 2019, $2.5 billion remained available for repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization limit. All repurchases are effected as redemptions in accordance with our Articles of Association.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments  




Purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services, which are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specify all significant terms.  


Includes total future minimum rent expense under non-cancelable leases for both occupied and vacated facilities (rent expense is shown net of sublease income).  


Consists of funding requirements related to strategic commitments.  

As of March 29, 2019, we had a liability of $41 million for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties, of which $3 million and an additional $1 million of interest and penalties could result in potential cash payments, none of which is expected to be settled within one year. Outside of one year, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances. However, actual future results may vary from our estimates.  

Other than as described in Part I, Item 1. Financial StatementsNote 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, there have been no other material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates. Refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2018, as filed with the SEC on August 3, 2018, for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.

 ITEM 3.  

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

We have exposure to market risks due to the volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit rating changes, equity and bond markets. A portion of these risks may be hedged, but fluctuations could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  

Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investment portfolio including investment in debt security in Toshiba Memory Corporation (TMC, formerly known as K.K. Pangea). As of March 29, 2019, we had no other-than-temporary impairment for our investment in debt security and we had no available-for-sale debt securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months. We determined no available-for-sale debt securities were other-than-temporarily impaired as of March 29, 2019.  

We have fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations. We enter into debt obligations for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs. Our 2019 revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus a variable margin.  

The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of March 29, 2019.  


Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. From time to time, we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures. Our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. At this time, we have not identified any material exposure associated with the potential changes related to the British vote to exit the European Union.  

We hedge portions of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates. Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts include an aggregate notional amount of 139.5 billion Japanese Yen ($1.3 billion at March 29, 2019 and June 29, 2018), to hedge foreign exchange fluctuations of our investment principal in non-convertible preferred stock debt security of TMC. We did not designate these contracts as hedges under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging and, therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities. All foreign currency forward exchange contracts discussed above mature within 12 months.  

We evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As of March 29, 2019, our foreign currency forward exchange contracts include a notional amount of approximately 10.1 billion Japanese Yen ($91 million), to hedge the PIK income related to our TMC investment, out of which $39 million is designated as a cash flow hedge and the remainder of $52 million was de-designated and included in contracts not designated as hedges.  


Table of Contents 

We did not have any material net gains or losses recognized in Other expense, net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness or discontinued cash flow hedges during the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019.  

The table below provides information as of March 29, 2019 about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts. The table is provided in U.S. dollar equivalent amounts and presents the notional amounts (at the contract exchange rates) and the weighted-average contractual foreign currency exchange rates.  



Equivalent to the unrealized net gain (loss) on existing contracts.  

Other Market Risks. We have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio. We monitor and limit our credit exposure for our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations. We also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty, and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institution. Additionally, the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk.  

Changes in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our near term financial results, but downgrades may negatively impact our future ability to raise capital, increase the cost of such capital and our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties.  

We have an investment in debt security of $1.3 billion carried at amortized cost. We review our debt security for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such asset below carrying value is other-than-temporary.  

We are subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our Seagate Deferred Compensation Plan (the SDCP). In fiscal year 2014, we entered into a Total Return Swap (TRS) in order to manage the equity market risks associated with the SDCP liabilities. We pay a floating rate, based on LIBOR plus an interest rate spread, on the notional amount of the TRS. The TRS is designed to substantially offset changes in the SDCP liability due to changes in the value of the investment options made by employees. See Part I, Item 1. Financial StatementsNote 7. Derivative Financial Instruments of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
