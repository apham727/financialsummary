NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

 1. Basis of presentation and new accounting pronouncements  

 In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly Avnet, Inc.’s and its consolidated subsidiaries’ (collectively, the “Company” or “Avnet”) financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  

 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  

 Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.  

 Certain reclassifications have been made in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation including reclassifications as a result of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.  

 Recently adopted accounting pronouncements  

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”, and collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”). Topic 606 supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance and requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services. The Company adopted Topic 606 on July 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of July 1, 2018. Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the consolidated statements of operations for the second quarter and six months ended December 29, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the second quarter and six months ended December 30, 2017 were not retrospectively adjusted, as such results were recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policy discussed under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

 The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date and as of and for the six months ended December 29, 2018. Substantially all of the Company’s sales continue to be recognized when products are shipped from the Company’s facilities or delivered to customers, depending on the respective contractual terms. For a nominal portion of the Company’s contracts where the accounting did change, the adoption of Topic 606 resulted in an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings of $2.0 million as of July 1, 2018. This impact was primarily due to the acceleration of recognition of net sales and associated gross profit related to certain uncompleted contracts for the manufacture of goods with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, from the customer for performance completed to date. For these contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the goods transfers through the manufacturing process, rather than when the goods are delivered, and title, risk and reward of ownership are passed to the customer, as under previous revenue recognition guidance.  

 Refer to Note 2 herein for further discussion regarding revenue recognition and related accounting policies.  

 In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)- Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost ("ASU No. 2017-07"). ASU No. 2017-07 requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension costs be included in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period, with the other components of the net periodic pension costs reported separately from the service cost component and below operating

income. The Company adopted this standard effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, which required changes to the classification of net periodic pension costs in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. The service cost component of the net periodic pension cost is now included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” with all other components of net periodic pension costs within “Other income, net” in the consolidated statements of operations. The adoption of ASU No. 2017-07 did not have any impact on the Company’s reported amount of income from continuing operations before taxes.  


 Recently issued accounting pronouncements  




 In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on its consolidated financial statements.

 AVNET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)  



 Prior to the adoption of Topic 606, the Company’s revenue recognition policy was in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replace revenue recognition policies discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  


 Revenue is recognized at the point at which control of the underlying products are transferred to the customer, which includes determining whether products are distinct and separate performance obligations. For electronic component and related product sales, this generally occurs upon shipment of the products, however, this may occur at a later date depending on the agreed upon sales terms, such as delivery at the customer's designated location, or when products that are consigned at customer locations are consumed. In limited instances, where products are not in stock and delivery times are critical, product is purchased from the supplier and drop-shipped to the customer. The Company typically takes control of the products when shipped by the manufacturer and then recognizes revenue when control of the product transfers to the customer. The Company does not have material product warranty obligations as the assurance type product warranties provided by the component manufacturers are passed through to the Company’s customers.  

 For contracts related to the specialized manufacture of products for customers with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the products transfer through the manufacturing process. The contract assets associated with such specialized manufacturing products are not material as these contracts represent less than 2% of the Company’s total sales.  


 Table of Contents  

 AVNET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)  

 Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products. The Company estimates different forms of variable consideration at the time of sale based on historical experience, current conditions and contractual obligations. Revenue is recorded net of customer discounts and rebates. When the Company offers the right or has a history of accepting returns of product, historical experience is utilized to establish a liability for the estimate of expected returns and an asset for the right to recover the product expected to be returned. These adjustments are made in the same period as the underlying sales transactions.   


 Sales and other tax amounts collected from customers for remittance to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. The Company has elected to treat shipping and handling of product as a fulfillment activity. The practical expedient not to disclose information about remaining performance obligations has also been elected as these contacts have an original duration of one year or less. The Company does not have any payment terms that exceed one year from the point it has satisfied the related performance obligations.   

 3. Acquisitions and Discontinued operations  

 Acquisition of Softweb Solutions  

 In December 2018, the Company acquired Softweb Solutions (“Softweb”) a privately held software and artificial intelligence company that delivers software solutions for Internet of Things (IoT) applications and systems designed to increase efficiency, speed time to market, and help businesses transform. The impact of this acquisition was not material to the Company’s consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations and as a result, the Company has not disclosed the preliminary allocation of purchase price or the pro-forma impact of the acquisition.  

 Discontinued Operations  

 In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Technology Solutions business (“TS business”) to Tech Data Corporation (the “Buyer”). The TS business and the financial impacts of the divestiture are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. In August 2018, the Company executed a settlement agreement with the Buyer resulting in a final adjustment of $120.0 million and a final geographic allocation of the TS business sales price for tax reporting purposes. This incremental consideration received from the sale of the TS business as well as cash settlements from the resolution of indemnification claims and other cash reimbursements have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations investing activities. Income tax payments related to the gain on sale of the TS business have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations operating activities.  

 In connection with the sale of the TS business, the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”), pursuant to which the Buyer will pay the Company to provide certain information technology, distribution, facilities, finance and human resources related services for various periods of time depending upon the services not to exceed approximately two years from the closing date. Expenses incurred by the Company to provide such services under the TSA are classified within selling, general and administrative expenses and amounts billed to the Buyer to provide such services are classified as a reduction of such expenses. As of December 29, 2018, the Buyer has formally terminated all TSA services.

 AVNET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)  

 Under the contractual terms of the sale of the TS business, the Company has indemnified the Buyer for certain liabilities including income and other tax related matters, which may result in future indemnification payments to the Buyer depending upon the outcome of those matters subject to indemnification.  

 4. Goodwill and long-lived assets  

 Goodwill  

 The following table presents the change in goodwill by reportable segment for the six months ended December 29, 2018.   


   (1) Includes accumulated impairment of $1,045,110 from fiscal 2009 and $181,440 from fiscal 2018 

 The Company evaluates each quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting units is less than its carrying value, which would require the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. Indicators the Company evaluates to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary include, but are not limited to (i) a sustained decrease in share price or market capitalization as of any fiscal quarter end, (ii) changes in the macroeconomic or industry environments, (iii) the results of and the amount of time passed since the last goodwill impairment test and (iv) the long-term expected financial performance of its reporting units. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company concluded that an interim goodwill impairment test was not required.  

 Intangible Assets  

 The following table presents the Company’s acquired intangible assets at December 29, 2018, and June 30, 2018, respectively.

 AVNET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)  

 The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Securitization Program”) in the United States with a group of financial institutions to allow the Company to transfer, on an ongoing revolving basis, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable, to provide security or collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of $500 million. The Securitization Program does not qualify for off balance sheet accounting treatment and any borrowings under the Securitization Program are recorded as debt in the consolidated balance sheets. Under the Securitization Program, the Company legally sells and isolates certain U.S. trade accounts receivable, into a wholly owned and consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Such receivables, which are recorded within “Receivables” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $814.6 million and $790.5 million at December 29, 2018, and June 30, 2018, respectively. The Securitization Program contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold. The Securitization Program also requires the Company to maintain certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of December 29, 2018, and June 30, 2018. The Securitization Program expires in August 2020 and as a result the Company has classified outstanding balances as long-term debt as of December 29, 2018. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a one-month LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.75%. The facility fee on the unused balance of the facility is up to 0.35%.  

 The Company has a five-year $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of banks, consisting of revolving credit facilities and the issuance of up to $200.0 million of letters of credit and up to $300.0 million of loans in certain approved currencies, which expires in June 2023. Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Facility may be increased up to $1.50 billion. Under the Credit Facility, the Company may select from various interest rate options, currencies and maturities. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants including various limitations on debt incurrence, share repurchases, dividends, investments and capital expenditures. The Credit Facility also includes financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of December 29, 2018, and June 30, 2018. As of December 29, 2018, and June 30, 2018, there were $3.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility.  

 As of December 29, 2018, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.96 billion and $1.97 billion, respectively. At June 30, 2018, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.65 billion and $1.67 billion, respectively. Fair value for the public notes was estimated based upon quoted market prices and for other forms of debt fair value approximates carrying value due to the market based variable nature of the interest rates on those debt facilities.  

 6. Derivative financial instruments  

 Many of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies. This subjects the Company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging (e.g., offsetting receivables and payables in the same foreign currency) as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward foreign exchange contracts typically with maturities of less than 60 days (“economic hedges”), but no longer than one year. The Company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not economically hedged. The Company adjusts any economic hedges to fair value through the consolidated statements of operations primarily within “other income, net.” The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, which are based upon Level 2 criteria under the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy, are classified in the captions “Prepaid and other current assets” or “Accrued expenses and other,” as applicable, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 29, 2018, and June 30, 2018. The Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with various financial institutions related to derivative financial instruments allow for the right of offset. The Company’s policy is to present derivative financial instruments with the same counterparty as either a net asset or liability when the right of offset exists.  

 The Company generally does not hedge its investments in its foreign operations. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and monitors the financial stability and credit standing of its counterparties.  


 Table of Contents  

 AVNET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)  






 Under the Company’s economic hedging policies, gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments are classified within the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations and as the underlying assets or liabilities being economically hedged.  

 7. Commitments and contingencies  

 From time to time, the Company may become a party to, or be otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of conducting its business. While litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, management does not anticipate that any such matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.   


 As of December 29, 2018 and June 30, 2018, the Company had aggregate estimated liabilities of $14.7 million and $14.2 million, respectively, classified within accrued expenses and other for such compliance-related matters that were reasonably estimable as of such dates.

 The Company’s effective tax rate on its income before income taxes from continuing operations was 43.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company’s effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) an adjustment to the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability recorded under the requirements of the Act and (ii) increases in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by (iii) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions, and (iv) the release of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets that were deemed to be realizable.   

 During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company’s effective tax rate of 8.6% was favorably impacted primarily by the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions, partially offset by the tax expense created from remeasuring net deferred tax assets as a result of applying the requirements of the Act.   

 For the first six months of fiscal 2019, the Company’s effective tax rate on its income before income taxes from continuing operations was 33.1%. The effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2019 was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) an adjustment to the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability recorded under the requirements of the Act and (ii) increases in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by (iii) an adjustment to the provisional deferred tax impacts of the Act, (iv) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions, and (v) the release of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets that were deemed to be realizable.   

 The Company’s effective tax rate is based on our interpretation of the changes under US tax reform including the computation of Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”). The Company has made a policy election to account for any impacts of the GILTI tax as a period expense. The Company’s FY19 effective tax rate may change in future periods due to changes in US tax law and the issuance of additional guidance related to US Tax Reform.  

 During the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company’s effective tax rate of 7.0% was favorably impacted primarily by (i) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions and (ii) the release of unrecognized tax benefit reserves primarily due to the negotiation of a favorable outcome in a foreign jurisdiction, partially offset by (iii) the tax expense created from remeasuring net deferred tax assets as a result of applying the requirements of the Act.  

 During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, which corresponds to the end of the measurement period allowed for under Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”), the Company finalized its estimate of the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability (the “transition tax”), resulting in an increase to the tax liability of $10.8 million due to additional analysis performed on foreign tax pools and earnings and profits computations. The total transition tax recorded as a result of the Act is estimated to be $257.5 million as of December 29, 2018. The transition tax may change in the future due to changes in tax law as enacted by the US Government, new guidance from federal and state regulators and related interpretations of the Act.   

 As of the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, the Company had recorded a provisional benefit of $2.4 million to account for the deferred tax impacts of the Act, which was increased by $1.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as a result of the Company refining its estimate of the fiscal year 2018 federal net operating loss. This amount may be further refined as the Company finalizes its income tax computations on its US income tax returns which are due in April 2019.  

 The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the Act including the Company’s historical assertion related to ASC 740 unremitted earnings. The Company has not changed its historical assertion as of December 29, 2018 that its ASC 740 unremitted earnings are permanently reinvested.

 In connection with the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, the Company now classifies service cost as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses and other components of net periodic pension costs within other income, net. The Company contributed $8.0 million to the Plans during the first six months of fiscal 2019 and expects to make an additional contribution to the Plans of $8.0 million in the remainder of fiscal 2019.  

 Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, to other income, net during the second quarters and first six months of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 were not material and substantially all related to net periodic pension costs including recognition of actuarial losses and amortization of prior service credits.  

 In connection with the sale of the TS business, a significant number of former employees became terminated vested employees under the Plan. During fiscal 2018, the aggregate amount of former employee withdrawals from the Plan exceeded the pension accounting settlement threshold for fiscal 2018, which required a settlement expense under ASC 715 pension accounting. As a result, the Company recorded a pension settlement expense of $14.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, which was classified as a component of loss from discontinued operations.

 Share repurchase program  

 In August 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors amended the Company’s existing share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to $2.45 billion of common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors such as share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and prevailing market conditions. During the second quarter and six months ended December 29, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.1 million and 7.4 million shares, respectively, under this program for a total cost of $175.1 million and $332.0 million, respectively. As of December 29, 2018, the Company had $440.1 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.  

 Common stock dividend  

 In November 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.20 per common share and dividend payments of $21.8 million were made in December 2018. During the six months ended December 29, 2018, the Company paid dividends of $0.40 per common share and $44.7 million in total.

 Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  




   ·    Sales adjusted for certain items that impact the year-over-year analysis, which includes the impact of certain acquisitions by adjusting Avnet’s prior periods to include the sales of acquired businesses, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Sales taking into account these adjustments are referred to as “organic sales.” 




 Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes. However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

 Results of Operations  

 Executive Summary  

 Sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 were $5.05 billion, an increase of 11.7% from sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 of $4.52 billion. The increase in sales was due to organic sales growth across all EC regions. Sales in constant currency increased year over year by 13.1% with both EC and PF contributing to the increase.  

 Gross profit margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 84 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018. EC gross profit margin decreased year over year primarily due to a higher percentage of sales coming from the lower-margin Asia region and from gross profit margin declines as a result of supplier program changes. PF gross profit margin decreased year over year primarily driven by changes in product mix and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.  

 Avnet operating income margin was 1.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared with 1.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Both periods included amortization and restructuring, integration and other expenses. Excluding these expenses from both periods, adjusted operating income margin was 3.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to 3.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in operating income margin is primarily due to the year over year growth in sales and a reduction in operating expenses from the Company’s restructuring and integration efforts, partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin.

 Sales  

 The following table presents reported and organic sales growth rates between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.   



 (1) The acquisition of Softweb occurred at the end of December 2018 and did not have any material sales between the date of acquisition and the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019.  

 Sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 were $5.05 billion, an increase of 11.7%, or $527.3 million, from the prior year second quarter sales of $4.52 billion. Sales in constant currency increased 13.1% over the prior year second quarter with all regions of both the EC and PF operating groups contributing to this growth.  

 EC sales of $4.68 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $517.2 million or 12.4% from the prior year second quarter sales of $4.16 billion. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales across all EC regions including double digit growth in both the EMEA and Asia regions. PF sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 were $368.3 million, an increase of $10.1 million or 2.8% from the prior year second quarter sales of $358.1 million driven by growth in all three regions.   

 Sales for the first six months of fiscal 2019 were $10.14 billion, an increase of 10.4% as compared to sales of $9.18 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2018 primarily due to sales growth across all regions at both EC and PF.  

 As discussed in Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 did not have a material impact on the amounts of sales reported or the comparability of sales and gross profit margins year over year for all periods presented in the consolidated statements of operations.  

 Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margins  

 Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $630.0 million, an increase of $27.6 million, or 4.6%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 gross profit of $602.5 million primarily driven by the increase in sales. Gross profit margin decreased 84 basis points to 12.5% from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 gross profit margin of 13.3%.  

 EC gross profit margin decreased year over year primarily due to an increased mix of sales coming from the lower-margin Asia region and from the impact of supplier program changes. Asia sales represented approximately 43% of the total EC sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared with approximately 42% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. PF gross profit margin decreased year over year primarily driven by product mix and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.   


 Table of Contents  

 Gross profit and gross margins were $1.27 billion and 12.5%, respectively, for the first six months of fiscal 2019 as compared with $1.22 billion and 13.2%, respectively, for the first six months of fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increased mix of sales coming from the lower-margin Asia region and from the impact of supplier program changes.   

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  




 Restructuring, Integration and Other Expenses  

 As a result of management’s focus on improving operating efficiencies and further integrating the acquisition of PF, the Company has incurred certain restructuring costs. These costs also related to the continued transformation of the Company’s information technology, distribution center footprint and business operations including the re-prioritization of its information technology initiatives and resources. In addition, the Company incurred integration, accelerated depreciation and other costs. Integration costs are primarily related to the integration of acquired businesses including PF, the integration of certain regional and global businesses including Avnet after the sale of the TS business, and incremental costs incurred as part of the consolidation, relocation, and closure of warehouse and office facilities. Accelerated depreciation relates to the incremental depreciation expense incurred related to the shortening of the estimated useful life for certain information technology assets and from the integration of PF. Other costs consist primarily of any other miscellaneous costs that relate to restructuring, integration and other expenses including acquisition related costs.  

 The Company recorded restructuring, integration and other expenses of $62.3 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The Company recorded $55.6 million of restructuring costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, which are expected to provide $10.0 million in operating expense savings once such restructuring actions are completed. Included in the restructuring costs was severance costs of $8.6 million and a $47.0 million non-cash impairment expense related to information technology software. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company also incurred integration costs of $3.4 million, accelerated depreciation expense of $2.7 million, other costs of $0.8 million and a reversal of $0.2 million for changes in estimates for costs associated with prior year restructuring actions. The after tax impact of restructuring, integration and other expenses were $46.6 million and $0.42 per share on a diluted basis.  

 During the first six months of fiscal 2019, the Company incurred restructuring costs of $63.2 million, integration costs of $6.2 million, accelerated depreciation of $5.8 million, other costs of $2.3 million and reversals of $0.5 million for changes in estimates for costs associated with prior year restructuring actions. The after tax impact of restructuring, integration and other expenses for the first six months of fiscal 2019 was $58.1 million and $0.51 per share on a diluted basis.  

 Comparatively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, restructuring, integration and other expenses were $36.8 million. The after tax impact of restructuring, integration, and other expenses was $27.8 million and $0.23 per share on a diluted basis.   


 Table of Contents  

 In the first six months of fiscal 2018, restructuring, integration and other expenses was $83.2 million. The after tax impact of restructuring, integration and other expenses for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was $57.4 million and $0.47 per share on a diluted basis.  

 See Note 14 “Restructuring expenses” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.   

 Operating Income  

 Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $96.1 million, an increase of $14.4 million, or 17.7%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 of $81.6 million. The year over year increase in operating income was primarily driven by the increase in sales and the reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year second quarter, partially offset by the decline in gross profit margin. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $178.8 million, an increase of $38.6 million, or 27.5%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The year over year increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the increase in sales and the reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year second quarter, partially offset by the decline in gross profit margin.  

 EC operating income margin increased 27 basis points year over year to 3.4% and PF operating income margin increased 142 basis points year over year to 10.8%. The improvement in operating income margin at both operating groups was primarily due to the organic sales growth and from operating cost reductions related to restructuring and integration activities.   

 Operating income for the first six months of fiscal 2019 was $242.9 million, or 2.4% of consolidated sales, as compared with operating income of $146.2 million, or 1.6% of consolidated sales in the first six months of 2018.  

 Interest and Other Financing Expenses, Net and Other Income, Net  

 Interest and other financing expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $33.7 million, an increase of $10.9 million or 47.7%, as compared with interest and other financing expenses of $22.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Interest and other financing expenses in the first six months of fiscal 2019 was $63.8 million, an increase of $19.0 million or 42.3%, as compared with interest and other financing expenses of $44.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018.The increase in interest and other financing expenses in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 was primarily related to increased expenses in Asia to finance working capital needs and from lower interest income from investments in cash equivalents between the fiscal years.  

 During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company had $2.6 million of other income as compared with $3.3 million of other income in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. During the first six months of fiscal 2019, the Company had $0.7 million of other income as compared with $22.3 million of other income in the first six months of fiscal 2018. In the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, the Company had income related to the Company’s pension plans, partially offset by foreign currency losses primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to certain currencies.  

 Income Tax Expense  

 The Company’s effective tax rate on its income before income taxes from continuing operations was 43.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company’s effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) an adjustment to the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability recorded under the requirements of the Act and (ii) increases in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by (iii) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions, and (iv) the release of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets that were deemed to be realizable.   


 Table of Contents  

 During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company’s effective tax rate of 8.6% was favorably impacted primarily by the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions, partially offset by the tax expense created from remeasuring net deferred tax assets as a result of applying the requirements of the Act.   

 For the first six months of fiscal 2019, the Company’s effective tax rate on its income before income taxes from continuing operations was 33.1%. The effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2019 was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) an adjustment to the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax liability recorded under the requirements of the Act and (ii) increases in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by (iii) an adjustment to the provisional deferred tax impacts of the Act, (iv) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions, and (v) the release of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets that were deemed to be realizable.   

 During the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company’s effective tax rate of 7.0% was favorably impacted primarily by (i) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions and (ii) the release of unrecognized tax benefit reserves primarily due to the negotiation of a favorable outcome in a foreign jurisdiction, partially offset by (iii) the tax expense created from remeasuring net deferred tax assets as a result of applying the requirements of the Act.  

 See Note 8 “Income taxes” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

 Income from Discontinued Operations  

 Loss from discontinued operations was $0.4 million and $0.2 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019.  

 Loss from discontinued operations was $10.1 million and $9.9 million in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively, primarily as a result of settlement losses associated with the Company’s pension plan due to former TS business employees requesting and receiving distributions from the Company’s pension plan during fiscal 2018.

During the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company generated $112.7 million of cash from investing activities – discontinued operations, substantially all driven by the sale of marketable securities obtained through the sale of the TS business.  

 Contractual Obligations  

 For a detailed description of the Company’s long-term debt and lease commitments for the next five years and thereafter, see Long-Term Contractual Obligations appearing in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. With the exception of the Company’s debt transactions discussed herein, there are no material changes to this information outside of normal borrowings and repayments of long-term debt and operating lease payments. The Company does not currently have any material non-cancellable commitments for capital expenditures or inventory purchases.  

 Financing Transactions  

 See Note 5, “Debt” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on financing transactions including the Credit Facility, the Securitization Program, and other outstanding debt as of December 29, 2018. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program as of December 29, 2018 and June 30, 2018.  

 The Company has various lines of credit, financing arrangements and other forms of bank debt in the U.S. and various foreign locations to fund the short-term working capital, foreign exchange, overdraft and letter of credit needs of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Outstanding borrowings under such forms of debt at the end of second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.9 million.

 As an alternative form of financing outside of the United States, the Company sells certain of its trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements. The Company accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables are recorded within “Interest and other financing expenses, net” and were not material.  

 Liquidity  

 The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $482.2 million as of December 29, 2018, of which $433.5 million was held outside the United States. As of June 30, 2018, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $621.1 million, of which $545.3 million was held outside of the United States.  

 As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company had a combined total borrowing capacity of $1.75 billion under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program. There were no borrowings outstanding and $3.0 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility and $471.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Securitization Program, resulting in approximately $1.28 billion of total availability as of December 29, 2018. Availability under the Securitization Program is subject to the Company having sufficient eligible trade accounts receivable to support desired borrowings. The Company currently expects to utilize availability under credit facilities to support working capital and other general corporate purposes to the extent such incremental borrowings do not impact the Company’s investment grade credit rating. During the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $184.0 million and 91.5 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility and approximately $256.0 million and $161.0 million, respectively, under the Securitization Program. During the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $0.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility and approximately $225.0 million and $195.0 million, respectively, under the Securitization Program.  

 During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities. Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth. The Company generated $299.9 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended December 29, 2018 from continuing operations.   

 Liquidity is subject to many factors, such as normal business operations as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors that are beyond the Company’s control. To the extent the cash balances held in foreign locations cannot be remitted back to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner, those cash balances are generally used for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure needs and to support acquisitions, and are currently expected to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The Company is still evaluating the impact of repatriating any additional foreign cash as a result of the Act. In addition, local government regulations may restrict the Company’s ability to move funds among various locations under certain circumstances. Management does not believe such restrictions would limit the Company’s ability to pursue its intended business strategy. Management believes that Avnet’s available borrowing capacity including capacity for the non-recourse sale of accounts receivable and the Company’s expected ability to generate operating cash flows in the future will be sufficient to meet its future liquidity needs. The Company also may issue debt or equity securities in the future and management believes the Company will have adequate access to the capital markets, if needed.  

 Historically the Company has made, and expects to continue to make, strategic investments through acquisition activity to the extent the investments strengthen Avnet’s competitive position, further its business strategies and meet management’s return on capital thresholds. The Company also expects to make capital expenditures, including expenditures for warehouse facilities and information technology related tools and systems. Additionally, as the Company integrates PF, the Company expects to use cash for restructuring, integration and other expenses.  


 Table of Contents  

 In addition to continuing to make investments in acquisitions, as of December 29, 2018, the Company may repurchase up to an aggregate of $440.1 million of shares of the Company’s common stock through a $2.45 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors. The Company may repurchase stock from time to time at the discretion of management, subject to strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors. The Company may terminate or limit the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors such as share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and prevailing market conditions. Additionally, the Company currently expects to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of its common stock, subject to approval of the Board of Directors. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.20 per share, which resulted in $21.8 million of dividend payments during the quarter.   

 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

 See Note 1, “Basis of presentation and new accounting pronouncements” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements.  

 Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

 The Company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements that are intended to provide an economic hedge against all or a portion of the risks associated with such volatility. The Company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not economically hedged.  

 See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, for further discussion of market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Avnet’s exposure to such risks has not changed materially since June 30, 2018, as the Company continues to economically hedge the majority of its foreign currency exchange exposures. Thus, any increase or decrease in fair value of the Company’s forward foreign currency exchange contracts is generally offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged position. For interest rate risk, the Company continues to maintain a combination of fixed and variable rate debt to mitigate the exposure to fluctuation in market interest rates.   

 See Liquidity and Capital Resources — Financing Transactions appearing in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the Company’s financing transactions and capital structure. As of December 29, 2018, 76% of the Company’s debt bears interest at a fixed rate and 24% of the Company’s debt bears interest at variable rates. Therefore, a hypothetical 1.0% (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would result in a $1.2 million decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.  

 Item 4.Controls and Procedures  

 The Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the reporting period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective such that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

 During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, there were no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II  

 OTHER INFORMATION  

 Item 1.Legal Proceedings  

 As a result primarily of certain former manufacturing operations, the Company has incurred and may have future liability under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing pollution and exposure to, and the handling, storage and disposal of, hazardous substances. For example, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and similar state laws, the Company is and may be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination on or from certain of its current or former properties, and at off-site locations where the Company disposed of wastes in the past. Such laws may impose joint and several liability. Typically, however, the costs for clean up at such sites are allocated among potentially responsible parties based upon each party’s relative contribution to the contamination, and other factors.  

 Pursuant to SEC regulations, including but not limited to Item 103 of Regulation S-K, the Company regularly assesses the status of and developments in pending environmental and other compliance related legal proceedings to determine whether any such proceedings should be identified specifically in this discussion of legal proceedings, and has concluded that no particular pending legal proceeding requires public disclosure. Based on the information known to date, management believes that the Company has appropriately accrued in its consolidated financial statements for its share of the estimable costs of environmental and other compliance related matters.
