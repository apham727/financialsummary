NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1. Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

In these notes, the terms “Corning,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Corning Incorporated and its subsidiary companies.

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted or condensed. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with Corning’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (“2018 Form 10-K”).

The unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results which may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on our results of operations, financial position, or changes in shareholders’ equity. 

Leases

Corning leases certain real estate, vehicles, and equipment from third parties. On January 1, 2019 we adopted the new leasing standard. Corning classifies leases as either financing or operating. Operating leases are included in other assets with the corresponding liability in other accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment with the corresponding liability in the current portion and long-term debt line items on our consolidated balance sheets. Leases where we are the lessor are not significant.

Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term for operating leases. Financing leases are recognized on the effective interest method for interest expense and straight-line method for asset amortization. Renewals and terminations are included in the calculation of the Right of Use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities when considered to be reasonably certain to be exercised. When the implicit rate is unknown, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. 

Our leases do not include residual value guarantees. We are not the primary beneficiary in or have other forms of variable interests with the lessor of the leased assets. The impact to the balance sheet for operating leases is a gross-up for the addition of ROU assets and liabilities relating to the operating leases in the amount of $449 million at adoption. The impact to the balance sheet for financing leases was not material.


Leases of less than 12 months in duration to be recorded as expense only;

Account for lease and non-lease components of a contract as a single lease component; and

Comparative reporting of prior periods under ASC 840 not restated due to modified retrospective implementation.

At adoption, Corning recorded a nominal cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings.

Refer to Note 4 (Leases) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Revenue

One of Corning’s equity affiliates adopted the new revenue standard on January 1, 2019. The impact of adopting the new standard to Corning’s financial statements was a net reduction of $186 million to 2019 beginning retained earnings. Timing of revenue recognition for certain open performance obligations as measured at January 1, 2019 under the new standard was approximately $239 million with offsetting deferred tax impacts of $53 million.

Index

Income Taxes 

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, which allows for reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We have adopted this new standard effective January 1, 2019. The impact of the new standard resulted in a reclassification of $53 million from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to beginning retained earnings.

Other Accounting Standards

No other accounting standards newly issued or adopted as of September 30, 2019, had a material impact on Corning’s financial statements or disclosures.


Revenue Disaggregation Table

The following table shows revenues by major product categories, similar to our reportable segment disclosure. Within each product category, contract terms, conditions and economic factors affecting the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty around revenue recognition and cash flows are substantially similar. The commercial markets and selling channels are also similar. Except for an inconsequential amount of revenue for Telecommunications products, our product category revenues are recognized at point in time when control transfers to the customer. 



Contract Assets and Liabilities

Contract assets, such as costs to obtain or fulfill contracts, are an insignificant component of Corning’s revenue recognition process. Most of Corning’s cost of fulfillment as a manufacturer of products is classified as inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets, which are accounted for under the respective guidance for those asset types. Other costs of contract fulfillment are immaterial due to the nature of our products and their respective manufacturing processes. 

Contract liabilities include deferred revenues, other advanced payments and customer deposits. Deferred revenue and other advanced payments are not significant to our operations and are classified as part of other current liabilities in our financial statements. Customer deposits are predominately related to Display products and are classified as part of other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities as appropriate and are disclosed below. 

We treat shipping and handling fees as a fulfillment cost and not as a separate performance obligation under the terms of our revenue contracts due to the perfunctory nature of the shipping and handling obligations.

Index

Customer Deposits

As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Corning had customer deposits of approximately $900 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. The majority of these were non-refundable cash deposits for customers to secure rights to an amount of glass produced by Corning under long-term supply agreements. The duration of these long-term supply agreements ranges up to 10 years. As glass is shipped to customers, Corning will recognize revenue and issue credit memoranda to reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability, which are applied against customer receivables resulting from the sale of glass. In the nine months ended September 30, 2019, a credit memorandum of $37 million was issued; no such memorandums were issued in 2018.  As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $851 million and $922 million were recorded as other long-term liabilities, respectively. The remaining $42 million and $54 million, respectively, were classified as other current liabilities. 

3. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees

Corning is a defendant in various lawsuits and is subject to various claims that arise in the normal course of business, the most significant of which are summarized below. In the opinion of management, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on Corning’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, is remote. 

Asbestos Claims

Corning and PPG Industries, Inc. each owned 50% of the capital stock of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (“PCC”). PCC filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in 2000, and the Modified Third Amended Plan of Reorganization for PCC (the “Plan”) became effective in April 2016. At December 31, 2016, the Company’s liability under the Plan was $290 million, which is required to be paid through a series of fixed payments that began in the second quarter of 2017. Payments of $50 million and $35 million were made in June 2019 and June 2018, respectively. The total amount of remaining payments due in years 2020 through 2023 is $135 million, of which $35 million will be paid in the second quarter of 2020 and is classified as a current liability. The remaining $100 million is classified as a non-current liability.

Non-PCC Asbestos Claims 

Corning is a defendant in certain cases alleging injuries from asbestos unrelated to PCC (the “non-PCC asbestos claims”) which had been stayed pending the confirmation of the Plan. The stay was lifted on August 25, 2016. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the amount of the reserve for these non-PCC asbestos claims was estimated to be $99 million and $146 million, respectively. The change in reserve reflects post-stay claim experience and a reduction in expected defense costs. The reserve balance as of September 30, 2019 represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees for the estimated life of the litigation. 

Dow Corning Chapter 11 Related Matters

Until June 1, 2016, Corning and The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) each owned 50% of the common stock of Dow Corning Corporation (“Dow Corning”). On May 31, 2016, Corning and Dow realigned their ownership interest in Dow Corning. Corning retained its indirect ownership interest in the Hemlock Semiconductor Group (“HSG”) and formed a new entity which had been capitalized by Dow Corning with $4.8 billion. Following the realignment, Corning no longer owned any interest in Dow Corning. With the realignment, Corning agreed to indemnify Dow Corning for 50% of Dow Corning’s non-ordinary course, pre-closing liabilities to the extent such liabilities exceed the amounts reserved for them by Dow Corning as of May 31, 2016, subject to certain conditions and limits.

Dow Corning Breast Implant Litigation

In May 1995, Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits. On June 1, 2004, Dow Corning emerged from Chapter 11 with a Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”) which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims. The Plan also includes releases for Corning and Dow as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the Plan.

Under the terms of the Plan, Dow Corning has established and funded a Settlement Trust and a Litigation Facility, referred to above, to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims. Inclusive of insurance, Dow Corning has paid approximately $1.8 billion to the Settlement Trust. As of May 31, 2016, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of $290 million. In the event Dow Corning’s total liability for these claims exceeds such amount, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow Corning for up to 50% of the excess liability, subject to certain conditions and limits. As of September 30, 2019, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of $165 million. As a result, Corning does not believe its indemnity obligation for Dow Corning’s breast implant litigation liability, if any, will be material.

Dow Corning Bankruptcy Pendency Interest Claims 

As a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings, Dow Corning has been defending claims asserted by commercial creditors who claimed additional compounded interest at default and state statutory judgment rates as well as attorneys’ fees and other enforcement costs, during the period from May 1995 through June 2004. As of May 31, 2016, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for these claims of $107 million. Dow Corning settled those claims as of September 30, 2019 and received approval of the settlement from the bankruptcy court. Corning had agreed to indemnify Dow Corning for up to 50% of Dow Corning’s liability in excess of its reserve if certain conditions were met. Corning does not believe its indemnity obligation, if any, for Dow Corning’s liability to be material.

Dow Corning Environmental Claims

In September 2019, Dow Corning formally notified Corning of certain environmental matters for which Dow Corning asserts that it has or will experience losses arising from remediation and response at a number of sites. In the event Dow Corning incurs liability for these claims, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow Corning for up to 50% of that liability, subject to certain conditions and limits. As of September 30, 2019, the Company cannot estimate the fair value of the indemnification owed to Dow Corning if any.

Environmental Litigation

Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (“the Agency”) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Corning had accrued approximately $39 million and $30 million, respectively, for the undiscounted estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.


We have operating and finance leases for real estate, vehicles, and equipment. 

We incurred lease expense in the amount of $44 million and $124 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. Operating lease costs were $37 million and $108 million, and Financing lease costs were $7 million and $16 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. Short-term rental expense, for agreements less than one year in duration, is immaterial. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, financing lease cost was comprised of expenses for depreciation of right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities, and these expenses were not material.

Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities totaled $30 million and $85 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. Operating cash outflows from operating leases were $26 million and $74 million, respectively. Financing cash outflows from finance leases were not material.

Index





The weighted average remaining lease terms for operating and financing leases are 12.6 years and 11.1 years, respectively. The weighted average discount rates for operating and financing leases are 4.1% and 5.5%, respectively.





As of September 30, 2019, we have additional operating leases, primarily for new production facilities and equipment, that have not yet commenced of approximately $284 million on an undiscounted basis. These operating leases will commence between fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020 with lease terms of 10 years to 20 years.

Index

For the three months ended September 30, 2019, the effective income tax rate differed from the United States (“U.S.”) statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in the estimated impact of base erosion and anti-deferral tax (“BEAT”) offset by the return to provision true-up of the U.S. Federal 2018 tax return filed in October 2019, primarily due to tax reform. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in the estimated impact of BEAT offset by return to provision true-up of the U.S. Federal 2018 tax return filed in October 2019, primarily due to tax reform, additional net tax expense of $86 million driven by changes to our tax reserves and the release of foreign valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.

For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to additional tax amounts related to the estimated annual impact of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) and BEAT offset by benefits related to Foreign Derived Intangible Tax (“FDII”) and a $48 million benefit related to an adjustment to the provisional estimate of the one-time Toll Charge recorded in 2017. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to additional tax expense of $172 million related to a preliminary agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to settle the income tax audits for the years 2013 and 2014, additional tax amounts related to the estimated annual impact of GILTI and BEAT, offset by benefits related to FDII, $28 million from the release of a foreign valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are now considered realizable and a $48 million benefit related to an adjustment to the provisional estimate of the one-time Toll Charge recorded in 2017. 

The company will use tax attributes to cover most of the expense related to the 2013-2014 IRS audit settlements. We expect to make a payment during the first quarter of 2020 of approximately $40 million to finalize those settlements with the IRS. As of September 30, 2019, the company is not expecting any significant movements in uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months.

7. Inventories, Net of Inventory Reserves




Based on borrowing rates currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of long-term debt was $6.9 billion and $6.0 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to recorded book values of $6.2 billion and $6.0 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The Company measures the fair value of its long-term debt using Level 2 inputs based primarily on current market yields for its existing debt traded in the secondary market.

Corning had no outstanding commercial paper at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

Debt Issuances



¥31.3 billion 1.153% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 12 years; and

¥5.9 billion 1.513% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 20 years.

The proceeds from the Notes were received in Japanese yen and converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance. The net proceeds received in U.S. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, were approximately $349 million and will be used for general corporate purposes. Payments of principal and interest on the Notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a U.S. dollar equivalent.

9. Employee Retirement Plans

We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our funding policy is to contribute, over time, an amount exceeding the minimum requirements to achieve the Company’s long-term funding targets. During 2019, we do not expect to make cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan but do expect to contribute $31 million to our international pension plans.



The components of net periodic benefit cost other than the service cost component are included in the line item “Other (expense) income, net” in the consolidated statements of income.

Cash Flow Hedges

Our cash flow hedging activities utilize over-the-counter (“OTC”) foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to customers and purchases from suppliers. The total gross notional values for foreign currency cash flow hedges are $2.0 billion and $0.4 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The majority of our foreign exchange forward contracts hedge a portion of the Company’s exposure to the Japanese yen denominated sales with maturities spanning the years 2020-2023 and with gross notional values of $1.5 billion at September 30, 2019. Corning defers gains and losses related to the cash flow hedges into accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until the hedged item impacts earnings. At September 30, 2019, the amount expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months is not material.

The effect of cash flow hedges on Corning’s consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income is not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.

Undesignated Hedges

Corning also uses OTC foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The undesignated hedges limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets, monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies.

Index

The table below includes a total gross notional value for translated earnings contracts of $13.2 billion and $13.6 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. These include gross notional value for average rate forwards of $10.7 billion and $11.0 billion, zero-cost collars and purchased put or call options of $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The majority of our average rate forward contracts hedge a significant portion of the Company’s exposure to the Japanese yen with maturities spanning the years 2019-2023 and with gross notional values of $8.0 billion and $9.1 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The average rate forward contracts also partially hedge the impacts of the South Korean won, Chinese yuan, euro, New Taiwan dollar and British pound translation on the Company’s projected net income. With respect to the zero-cost collars, the gross notional amount includes the value of both the put and call options. However, due to the nature of the zero-cost collars, only the put or the call option can be exercised at maturity.

12. Fair Value Measurements










For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, assets and liabilities that were measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs resulted in unrealized gains recognized in earnings of $21 million for a renewable energy derivative contract and the reversal of a liability for contingent consideration of $20 million.

There were no significant financial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A 

Corning has 2,300 outstanding shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A. The Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder and the Company upon certain events, at a conversion rate of 50,000 shares of Corning’s common stock per one share of Preferred Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions. As of September 30, 2019, the Preferred Stock has not been converted, and none of the anti-dilution provisions have been triggered. 

Share Repurchases

In December 2016, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $4 billion share repurchase program with no expiration date (the “2016 Repurchase Program”). On April 26, 2018, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $2 billion share repurchase program with no expiration date (the “2018 Repurchase Program”). On July 17, 2019, Corning’s Board of Directors authorized $5 billion in share repurchases with no expiration date (the “2019 Repurchase Authorization”).

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 10.8 and 23.4 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $308 million and $703 million, respectively, as part of its 2018 Repurchase Program.

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 11.8 million and 63.4 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $384 million and $1.9 billion, respectively, as part of its 2016 and 2018 Repurchase Programs. 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss was primarily related to the foreign currency translation adjustment.

OVERVIEW

Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework and recently introduced Strategy and Growth Framework

In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value. The Framework outlined our leadership priorities and articulated the opportunities we saw across our businesses. We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength. Under the Framework, we targeted generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth. As of June 30, 2019, Corning met its goal of returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and is on track to invest $11 billion for growth and extended leadership.

On June 14, 2019, Corning introduced its 2020-2023 Strategy and Growth Framework. From 2020 to 2023, the company plans to invest $10 billion to $12 billion for growth and to return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders.

Summary of results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019


Net sales in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $59 million, with volume decreases and display glass price declines in the low single-digits; 

Optical Communications net sales declined $110 million. Net sales of carrier products were $105 million lower due to general market weakness and capital spending reductions by several major carriers;

Specialty Materials segment net sales increased by $4 million;

Net sales for Environmental Technologies increased $66 million, primarily driven by sales growth of gasoline particulate filters; and

Life Sciences net sales increased by $25 million, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.


Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $82 million, with volume increases in the high single-digits more than offsetting moderate display glass price declines;

Optical Communications net sales increased $135 million, primarily due to higher sales of enterprise network products, up $152 million, including the impact of sales from the acquisition of CMD, offset by lower carrier sales of $17 million; 

Specialty Materials segment net sales increased by $61 million primarily driven by sales of Gorilla Glass and Advanced Optics products; 

Net sales for Environmental Technologies increased $155 million, primarily driven by sales growth of gasoline particulate filters and strong demand for heavy-duty diesel products; and

Life Sciences net sales increased by $51 million, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.


Translated earnings contract gains in the current period were $106 million lower than prior year gains; 

Higher costs of $116 million, primarily driven by accelerated depreciation in our Display Technologies segment and asset write-offs for our Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments; and 

Lower segment net income of $33 million, $41 million and $24 million for the Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments, respectively.

The decreases in net income outlined above were slightly offset by higher net income for the Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments of $19 million and $11 million, respectively.

Diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.29 per share when compared to the third quarter of 2018, driven by the decrease in net income described above, offset by the repurchase of 34.7 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.


Translated earnings contract gains in the current period were $75 million higher than prior year gains;

Higher segment net income of $64 million driven by increased sales;

The positive impact of discrete tax and other tax-related items in the amount of $109 million, largely driven by the absence of a $172 million IRS audit settlement, or approximately $40 million tax payable after utilization of tax attributes, recorded in the first quarter of 2018 offset by changes to our tax reserves and a release of foreign valuation allowances on deferred tax assets; and

Costs related to litigation, regulatory and other legal matters were $130 million lower, primarily driven by the absence of a $103 million charge related to legal matters recorded in 2018, including a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in civil litigation.

Higher costs of $136 million, primarily driven by accelerated depreciation in our Display Technologies segment and asset write-offs for our Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments; and

Higher translation losses on Japanese yen-denominated debt of $30 million.

Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.21 per share when compared to the same period in 2018, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 34.7 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.

The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018. 


In our Display Technologies segment, we now expect full year 2019 price declines to improve further to a low-single digit percentage compared to our previous guidance of low-to-mid single digit declines. We anticipate Corning’s display glass volume will increase slightly, outperforming the market. In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to decrease three to five percent year-over-year. We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, despite a maturing phone market. We expect sales growth in our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments in the mid-teens and mid-single-digit percentages, respectively.

Cost of Sales


Gross Margin 

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, gross margin decreased by $215 million, or 17%, and $78 million, or 2%, respectively. Gross margin as a percentage of sales declined by 6% and 2%, respectively. Negative impacts to gross margin were primarily driven by accelerated depreciation for the Display Technologies segment and asset write-offs in our Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

When compared to the third quarter of 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses declined by $70 million, or 16%, in the three months ended September 30, 2019, driven by lower variable compensation expense and reduced operating expenses in Display Technologies and Optical Communications to align with near-term sales projections. 

When compared to the first nine months of 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $168 million, or 12%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease was due to the absence of a $132 million charge related to legal matters in 2018, including a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in civil litigation matters and a reduction of variable compensation expense of $37 million and reduced operating expenses in Display Technologies and Optical Communications to align with near-term sales projections; partially offset by an increase of $39 million in the Optical Communications segment, driven largely by the acquisition of CMD in June 2018.

Selling, general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of sales by 2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Research, Development and Engineering Expenses 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $11 million, or 5%, and $25 million, or 3%, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year, driven by higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses. As a percentage of sales, these expenses were similar when compared to the same periods last year. 

Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies



In the third quarter ending September 30, 2019, equity in earnings of affiliated companies declined by $9 million primarily driven by lower sales volumes for some of our affiliates.

Equity in earnings of affiliated companies for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $21 million, primarily driven by the absence of a gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018 resulting from a legal settlement.

Income Before Income Taxes 

The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated income before income taxes in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.

Provision for Income Taxes 



For the three months ended September 30, 2019, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in the estimated impact of BEAT offset by the return to provision true-up of the U.S. Federal 2018 tax return filed in October 2019, primarily due to tax reform. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in the estimated impact of BEAT offset by return to provision true-up of the U.S. Federal 2018 tax return filed in October 2019, primarily due to tax reform, additional net tax expense of $86 million driven by changes to our tax reserves and the release of foreign valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.

For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to additional tax amounts related to the estimated annual impact of GILTI and BEAT offset by benefits related to FDII and a $48 million benefit related to an adjustment to the provisional estimate of the one-time Toll Charge recorded in 2017. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to additional tax expense of $172 million related to a preliminary agreement with the IRS to settle the income tax audits for the years 2013 and 2014, additional tax amounts related to the estimated annual impact of GILTI and BEAT, offset by benefits related to FDII, $28 million from the release of a foreign valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are now considered realizable and a $48 million benefit related to an adjustment to the provisional estimate of the one-time Toll Charge recorded in 2017.

Net Income Attributable to Corning Incorporated




Comprehensive Income 

For the three months ended September 30, 2019 comprehensive income decreased by $444 million when compared to the same period in 2018, due to lower net income of $288 million and $110 million of negative impacts from the change in foreign currency translation losses, driven primarily by the Korean won. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 comprehensive income increased by $71 million when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in net income of $154 million offset by $53 million related to the adoption of the new standard for reclassification of stranded tax effects in AOCI.

CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to report core performance measures. These items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates. Corning utilizes constant-currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and new Taiwan dollar currencies. Effective January 1, 2019, Corning also began using constant-currency reporting for our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments for the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The Company believes that the use of constant-currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations, and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows. Corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.

Core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures. With respect to the Company’s outlooks for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast foreign currency exchange rates or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control. As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.

Effective July 1, 2019, we have replaced the term “Core Earnings” with “Core Net Income”. The terms are interchangeable and the underlying calculations remain the same.

For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures”.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES




Core Net Sales

Core Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies



Core Net Income

For the three months ended September 30, 2019, we generated core net income of $397 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to core net income generated in the three months ended September 30, 2018 of $476 million, or $0.51 per share. The decrease of $79 million was due to lower net income across the Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments, partially offset by higher net income for the Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we generated core net income of $1,172 million, or $1.30 per share, compared to core net income generated in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $1,134 million, or $1.20 per share. The increase of $38 million was due to increased core net income across most reportable segments. 

Included in core net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 is net periodic pension expense in the amounts of $22 million and $64 million, respectively, and $13 million and $38 million respectively. 

Refer to Note 9 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the consolidated financial statements.

Core Earnings per Common Share



Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows.

Core net sales, core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core net income are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the Company’s operations.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS


Display Technologies – manufactures glass substrates primarily for flat panel displays.

Optical Communications – manufactures carrier and enterprise network components for the telecommunications industry.

Specialty Materials – manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs.

Environmental Technologies – manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel emission control applications. 

Life Sciences – manufactures glass and plastic labware, equipment, media and reagents enabling workflow solutions for scientific applications.

All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.” This group is primarily comprised of the results of the pharmaceutical technologies business, auto glass, new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates. 


We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment’s net income. We have allocated certain common expenses among reportable segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information. Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. 

Display Technologies



Net sales in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $59 million in the three months ended September 30, 2019, driven by volume decreases and display glass price declines in the low single-digits. Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $82 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, with the increase in glass volume in the high-single digits in percentage terms more than offsetting moderate price declines. 

Net income in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $33 million and increased by $11 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, driven by the changes in sales outlined above. 


For the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect our volume to be down mid-single digits sequentially. Fourth-quarter display glass prices are expected to decline slightly from the third quarter. We expect full-year pricing to be down low-single digits year-over-year.

Optical Communications



Optical Communications net sales declined $110 million, or 10%, in the three months ended September 30, 2019. Net sales of carrier products were $105 million lower due to general market weakness and capital spending reductions by several major carriers. Net sales of enterprise products were $5 million lower.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, net sales increased $135 million, or 4%, primarily due to increased sales of enterprise network products of $152 million offset by lower sales of $17 million for carrier products. The acquisition of CMD, which took place during June of 2018, contributed to year-over-year sales growth.

Net income decreased by $41 million, or 24%, and remained flat, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily driven by the changes in sales, outlined above.


In the fourth quarter, Optical Communications sales are expected to decrease approximately 25 percent year-over-year. We expect full-year sales to decline 3 to 5 percent.

Specialty Materials



Net sales in the Specialty Materials segment increased by $4 million, or 1%, and $61 million, or 6%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. Increased sales of Gorilla Glass and Advanced Optics products drove the increase for the first half of 2019. However, third quarter shipments of Gorilla Glass in China were lower due to the current trade environment and sales of Advanced Optics products were down due to semiconductor market weakness. 

Net income decreased by $24 million, or 21%, and $18 million, or 8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, impacted by the sales drivers outlined above.


The company expects full-year sales growth, despite a maturing smartphone market. For the fourth-quarter, sales are expected to be consistent year over year.

Environmental Technologies



Net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment increased $66 million, or 20%, and $155 million, or 16%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. Automotive product sales increased $70 million and $125 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, due to continued sales growth of gasoline particulate filters. Diesel product sales decreased $4 million and increased $30 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. 

Net income increased by $19 million, or 32%, and $33 million, or 20%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, primarily driven by increases in sales outlined above. 


This strong performance is expected to continue in the fourth quarter, with sales growth up by a low-teen percentage year over year, leading to full-year sales growth expectations of a mid-teen percentage.

Life Sciences 



Net sales in the Life Sciences segment increased by $25 million, or 11%, and $51 million, or 7%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.

Net income increased by $11 million, or 37%, and $24 million, or 27%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. The increase was driven by the sales increase outlined above and improved manufacturing efficiencies. 


Fourth-quarter and full-year sales are expected to grow mid-single digits year over year. 

All Other

All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.” This group is primarily comprised of the results of the pharmaceutical technologies business and new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates.

Index

Net sales of this segment decreased by $2 million, or 4%, and increased by $4 million, or 3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018, driven primarily by sales changes in our emerging businesses. Net loss decreased by $2 million, or 3%, and $14 million, or 6%, primarily driven by lower spending on development projects when compared to the same periods in 2018.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Financing and Capital Resources


Debt Issuances



¥31.3 billion 1.153% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 12 years; and

¥5.9 billion 1.513% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 20 years.

The proceeds from the Notes were received in Japanese yen and converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance. The net proceeds received in U.S. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, were approximately $349 million and will be used for general corporate purposes. Payments of principal and interest on the Notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a U.S. dollar equivalent. 


In the second quarter of 2018, Corning issued ¥65.5 billion Japanese yen-denominated debt securities in tranches of 7, 10 and 12 years. The proceeds from these notes were received in Japanese yen and immediately converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance. The net proceeds received in U.S. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, was $596 million. Payments of principal and interest on the notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a U.S. dollar equivalent. 

In the third quarter of 2018, Corning amended and restated its revolving credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”). The Revolving Credit Agreement provides a $1.5 billion unsecured multi-currency line of credit and expires August 15, 2023. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which Corning must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant. The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%. 

Share Repurchase Program

In December 2016, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $4 billion share repurchase program with no expiration date (the “2016 Repurchase Program”). On April 26, 2018, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $2 billion share repurchase program with no expiration date (the “2018 Repurchase Program”). On July 17, 2019, Corning’s Board of Directors authorized $5 billion in share repurchases with no expiration date (the “2019 Repurchase Authorization”).

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 10.8 and 23.4 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $308 million and $703 million, respectively, as part of its 2018 Repurchase Program.

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 11.8 million and 63.4 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $384 million and $1.9 billion, respectively, as part of its 2016 and 2018 Repurchase Programs. 

Capital Spending

Capital spending totaled $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. We expect our 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.0 billion.

Index

Cash Flow 



Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $965 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the prior year. The change was primarily driven by fewer customer deposits and incentives received of $689 million, and a larger increase in working capital as compared to the same period in 2018. 

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $732 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by last year’s acquisition of substantially all of CMD for approximately $800 million.

Net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $1.3 billion when compared to the same period last year, driven primarily by a decrease of $1.2 billion in share repurchases. 

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our funding policy is to contribute, over time, an amount exceeding the minimum requirements to achieve the Company’s long-term funding targets. During 2019, we do not expect to make cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan but do expect to contribute $31 million to our international pension plans.

Key Balance Sheet Data




Management Assessment of Liquidity

We ended the third quarter of 2019 with approximately $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world, with approximately 73% held outside of the United States, and are generally unrestricted. We utilize a variety of strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.

Corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.5 billion. Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company’s Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed. Corning had no outstanding commercial paper at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 

Other 

We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments

and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues. We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.

Our major sources of funding for 2019 and beyond will be our operating cash flow and proceeds from any issuances of debt. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.

Our Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant. The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%. At September 30, 2019, our leverage using this measure was approximately 33%. As of September 30, 2019, we were in compliance and no amounts were outstanding.

Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument. As of September 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all such provisions.

Management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity. In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our off-balance sheet arrangements as disclosed in our 2018 Form 10-K under the caption “Off Balance Sheet Arrangements.”

Contractual Obligations

There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the contractual obligations disclosed in our 2018 Form 10-K under the caption “Contractual Obligations.”

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described in our 2018 Form 10-K and remain unchanged through the first nine months of 2019. For certain items, additional details are provided below.

Impairment of Assets Held for Use

We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. We review our long-lived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.

Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium. These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process and have a very long useful life. Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets. This review considers all the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity. Precious metals are only acquired to support our manufacturing operations and are not held for trading or other purposes.

At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the carrying value of precious metals was lower than the fair market value by $578 million and higher than the fair market value by $719 million, respectively. These precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments. Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments. The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments. Such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our Display Technologies or Specialty Materials segments.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements.

ENVIRONMENT 

Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (“the Agency”) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Corning had accrued approximately $39 million and $30 million, respectively, for the undiscounted estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the SEC on Forms 8-K, and related comments by management that are not historical facts or information and contain words such as “will,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “see,” “would,” and “target” and similar expressions are forward-looking statements. Such statements relate to future events that by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, the company’s future operating performance, the company's share of new and existing markets, the company's revenue and earnings growth rates, the company’s ability to innovate and commercialize new products, and the company’s implementation of cost-reduction initiatives and measures to improve pricing, including the optimization of the company’s manufacturing capacity.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk Disclosures

As noted in our 2018 Form 10-K, we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and other currencies. Volatility in the global financial markets could increase the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates which would, in turn, impact our sales and net income. For a discussion of our exposure to market risk and how we mitigate that risk, refer to Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks, contained in our 2018 Form 10-K.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision of and with the participation of Corning’s management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of September 30, 2019, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, we have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. Corning’s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Corning in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Corning’s management, including Corning’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or other persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

An evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting was also performed to determine whether any changes have occurred during the period covered by this Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that there was no change in Corning’s internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
