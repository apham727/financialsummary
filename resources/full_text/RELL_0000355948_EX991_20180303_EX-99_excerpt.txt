 For Immediate Release  


 RICHARDSON ELECTRONICS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2018 PROFIT 

 AND DECLARES QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND  

 Company Beats Q2 Performance; Achieves Operating Income of $1.0 million in Q3  


 Third Quarter Results  

 Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 28.9% to $41.6 million compared to net sales of $32.3 million in the prior year’s third quarter. Sales increased $7.1 million for PMT and $2.7 million for Canvys. PMT sales were higher in power conversion and RF and microwave components, industrial power grid tubes and specialty products sold into the semiconductor wafer fabrication capital equipment market. Sales increased for Canvys due to new program wins and higher overall demand across both the U.S. and Europe. Sales decreased for Richardson Healthcare by $0.5 million due to the sale of the PACS Display business at the end of fiscal 2017, partially offset by higher equipment and certified pre-owned CT Tube sales.  

 Gross margin increased to $14.1 million, or 33.8% of net sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $10.7 million, or 33.1% of net sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Margin increased as a percent of net sales primarily due to an improved product mix in both PMT and Canvys.  

 Operating expenses were $13.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $12.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Operating expenses increased due to additional compensation and other expenses primarily related to the increase in net sales as well as higher research and development and other expenses for Richardson Healthcare. Operating expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 31.4% in the current quarter from 37.1% last year.  

 As a result, the company reported $1.0 million of operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to an operating loss of $1.3 million in the prior year’s third quarter. Other income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily interest income, was less than $0.1 million, compared to other expense of $0.1 million, primarily a foreign exchange loss, for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.  

The income tax provision of $0.5 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected a provision for foreign income taxes based on the current quarter’s geographical distribution of income, adjustments from foreign income tax returns recently filed and no U.S. tax benefit due to the valuation allowance recorded against the net operating loss. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the company calculated its estimated tax liability as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cut and Jobs Act. The $11.2 million liability was entirely offset by newly generated foreign tax credits and foreign tax credit carryforwards. In addition, the company wrote-down $1.6 million of its net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets against the valuation allowance due to the reduction in the federal tax rate.  

Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $0.5 million compared to a net loss of $1.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. 

 FINANCIAL SUMMARY – NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 3, 2018  

   ●   Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 were $117.7 million, an increase of 18.3%, compared to net sales of $99.5 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Sales increased by $15.7 million for PMT and $5.2 million for Canvys. These increases were partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease for Richardson Healthcare, which was due to the divestiture of the PACS Display business at the end of fiscal 2017.    

   ●   Gross profit increased to $39.6 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to $31.9 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2017. In addition, as a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased to 33.6% of net sales during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to 32.1% of net sales during the first nine months of fiscal 2017, mostly as a result of an improved product mix.    

   ●   Operating expenses increased to $38.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to $37.7 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. The increase was due to additional compensation and other expenses mostly related to the higher net sales as well as increased research and development and other expenses for Richardson Healthcare. These increases were partially offset by the $1.3 million in severance expense associated with the reduction in work force during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.    

   ●   Operating income during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $1.8 million, compared to an operating loss of $5.8 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2017.     

   ●   Other expense for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, including foreign exchange, was $0.1 million, compared to other expense of $0.2 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2017.    

   ●   The income tax provision of $1.1 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 reflected a provision for foreign income taxes, additional tax due from an audit in Germany and no U.S. tax benefit due to the valuation allowance recorded against the net operating loss. The tax provision of $0.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 included a provision for foreign income taxes, additional tax due from an audit in France and no U.S. tax benefit due to the valuation allowance recorded against the net operating loss.    

   ●   Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $0.6 million, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $6.8 million in the first nine months of 2017. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company received an income tax refund from the State of Illinois, inclusive of interest and net of professional fees, of $1.5 million. This refund was a result of the conclusion of the Illinois amended return related to the sale of RFPD in 2011 and was therefore, classified as income from discontinued operations.    

   ●   Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $2.1 million, compared to a net loss of $6.8 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
