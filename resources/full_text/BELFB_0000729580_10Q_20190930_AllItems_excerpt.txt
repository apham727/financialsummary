NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

  1.   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

The condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the periods presented herein have been prepared by the Company and are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented have been made. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Bel Fuse Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures required under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted from these condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations, including the interim reporting requirements, of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

The Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, except as discussed in “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards” below. 

All amounts included in the tables to these notes to condensed consolidated financial statements, except per share amounts, are in thousands. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), to provide a new comprehensive model for lease accounting. Under this guidance, lessees and lessors should apply a “right-of-use” model in accounting for all leases (including subleases) and eliminate the concept of operating leases and off-balance sheet leases. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. Similar modifications have been made to lessor accounting in-line with revenue recognition guidance. This guidance was effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments also require certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements. 

The Company adopted ASU 2016-02, as amended, effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. In connection with the adoption, we elected to utilize the Comparatives Under 840 Option whereby the Company will continue to present prior period financial statements and disclosures under ASC 840. In addition, we elected the transition package of three practical expedients permitted within the standard, which eliminates the requirements to reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. Further, we elected a short-term lease exception policy, permitting us to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e. leases with terms of 12 months or less) and an accounting policy to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component for certain classes of assets. We implemented a new lease system to facilitate the requirements of the new standard and completed the necessary changes to our accounting policies, processes, disclosures and internal control over financial reporting. 

Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of right-of-use assets in the amount of $20.7 million and lease liabilities related to our operating leases in the amount of $21.0 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019. The standard did not materially affect the Company’s consolidated net earnings or have any impact on cash flows. See Note 13, Leases, for Topic 842 disclosures in connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-02.

Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted 






Table of Contents  







The change in balance of our unbilled receivables from December 31, 2018 to September 30, 2019 primarily relates to a timing difference between the Company’s performance (i.e. when our product is shipped to a customer-controlled hub) and the point at which the Company can invoice the customer per the terms of the customer contract (i.e. when the customer pulls our product from the customer-controlled hub). 

The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have not been satisfied as of September 30, 2019 related to contracts that exceed one year in duration amounted to $15.7 million, with expected contract expiration dates that range from 2020 - 2025. It is expected that 20% of this aggregate amount will be recognized in 2020, 57% will be recognized in 2021 and the remainder will be recognized in years beyond 2021.

  4.   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS    


Level 1 – Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets; 

Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and 

Level 3 – Unobservable inputs about which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 

As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale securities primarily consisted of investments held in a rabbi trust which are intended to fund the Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) obligations. These securities are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) inputs and amounted to $1.2 million at September 30, 2019 and $1.4 million at December 31, 2018. The Company does not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 or September 30, 2018. There were no changes to the Company’s valuation techniques used to measure asset fair values on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 or September 30, 2018. 

There were no financial assets accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018. 


Table of Contents  

The Company has other financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, which are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow method based on interest rates that are currently available for debt issuances with similar terms and maturities. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of total debt was $116.8 million and $117.9 million, respectively, compared to a carrying amount of $112.3 million and $114.2 million, respectively. The Company did not have any other financial liabilities within the scope of the fair value disclosure requirements as of September 30, 2019. 

Nonfinancial assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, are accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These items are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. We review goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis annually during the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. As weakened market conditions from earlier in 2019 continued into the third quarter without a visible rebound in incoming orders, the Company’s actual revenue and margin levels in 2019 were significantly lower than the financial projections utilized in the annual goodwill impairment analysis (performed as of October 1, 2018), and were not projected to rebound to those levels in 2019. The Company determined that current business conditions, and the resulting decrease in the Company’s projected undiscounted and discounted cash flows, together with the accompanying stock price decline, constituted a triggering event, which required the Company to perform interim impairment tests related to its long-lived assets and goodwill during the third quarter of 2019. The Company’s interim test on its long-lived assets indicated that the carrying value of its long-lived assets was recoverable and that no impairment existed as of the July 31, 2019 testing date.  


The July 31, 2019 interim impairment test related to the Company's goodwill was performed by reporting unit (North America and Europe). The valuation test, which heavily weights future discounted cash flow projections, indicated impairment of the goodwill associated with the Company’s North America reporting unit. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $8.9 million ($8.5 million after-tax) during the third quarter of 2019. The Company’s goodwill associated with its North America reporting unit originated from several of Bel’s prior acquisitions, primarily Power Solutions and Connectivity Solutions. The carrying value of the Company's goodwill was $19.8 million at December 31, 2018. The remaining goodwill as of September 30, 2019 has a carrying value of $10.8 million related solely to the Company's Europe reporting unit. See Note 5, Goodwill.  

Detailed below is a table of key underlying assumptions utilized in the fair value estimate calculation for the interim test performed as of July 31, 2019 as compared to those assumptions utilized during the annual valuation performed as of October 1, 2018. The table below shows the assumptions utilized for the North America reporting unit. 


The Company had also performed an interim impairment analysis of its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of July 31, 2019. The Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment using a fair value approach, the relief-from-royalty method (a form of the income approach). At December 31, 2018, the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the trademarks acquired in the Power Solutions, Connectivity Solutions, Cinch and Fibreco acquisitions. The Company's interim test on its indefinite-lived intangible assets indicated that the carrying value of its long-lived assets was recoverable and that no impairment existed as of the July 31, 2019 testing date.  







  7.    PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT    



Depreciation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $2.5 million and $2.8 million, respectively. Depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $7.5 million and $8.9 million, respectively. Depreciation expense related to our manufacturing facilities and equipment is included in cost of sales and depreciation expense associated with administrative facilities and office equipment is included in selling, general and administrative expense within the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

During the second quarter of 2019, the Company transitioned its manufacturing and warehousing operations from its Inwood, New York facility to Bel’s existing facilities in Glen Rock, Pennsylvania and the Dominican Republic. In connection with this transition, the Company sold its Inwood, New York property during the second quarter of 2019, which resulted in net proceeds of $5.8 million. The accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 includes a related gain on sale of $4.3 million (pre-tax).  


Table of Contents  




The change in warranty accrual during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily related to repair costs incurred and adjustments to pre-existing warranties. There were no new material warranty charges incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 

Restructuring Activities 





The Company has a Credit and Security Agreement with KeyBank National Association (as amended, the “CSA”). The CSA consists of (i) a term loan, with outstanding borrowings of $113.8 million and $116.0 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively and (ii) a $75 million revolving credit facility (“Revolver”), with no outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018. The CSA has a maturity date of December 11, 2022. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the carrying value of the debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheet is reflected net of $1.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of deferred financing costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company borrowed $12.0 million from its revolver, all of which was repaid by September 30, 2019. 

The weighted-average interest rate in effect was 3.81% at September 30, 2019 and 4.31% at December 31, 2018 and consisted of LIBOR plus the Company’s credit spread, as determined per the terms of the CSA. The Company incurred $1.3 million and $1.4 million of interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively, and $4.1 million and $3.9 million of interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively. 

The CSA contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined, (“Leverage Ratio”) and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA to the Company’s consolidated fixed charges. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the CSA would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016 and for state examinations before 2013. Regarding foreign subsidiaries, the Company is no longer subject to examination by tax authorities for years before 2008 in Asia and generally 2011 in Europe. The Company is currently under examination by the taxing authorities in Slovakia for the tax year 2014. 

As a result of the expiration of the statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized benefits for tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns may change materially from those recorded as liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the Company’s consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2019. The Company’s liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaled $28.6 million and $28.9 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, of which $2.1 million and $1.4 million is included in other current liabilities at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. These amounts, if recognized, would reduce the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 30, 2019, approximately $2.1 million of the Company’s liabilities for uncertain tax positions are expected to be resolved during 2019 by way of expiration of the related statute of limitations. 

The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the current provision for income taxes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in interest and penalties in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized a benefit of $0.7 million and a benefit of $0.3 million, respectively, for the reversal of such interest and penalties, relating to the settlement of the liability for uncertain tax positions. The Company has approximately $4.7 million and $3.8 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which is included in both income taxes payable and liability for uncertain tax positions in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

The Company continues to monitor the impacts of the U.S. tax reform and supplementary guidance as it becomes available. At December 31, 2018, the remaining balance of the deemed repatriation tax was included in other current liabilities on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. At September 30, 2019, the majority of the deemed repatriation tax is included in other long-term liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet due to clarification of an Internal Revenue Service notice received in December 2018.  

  11.   RETIREMENT FUND AND PROFIT SHARING PLAN    

The Company maintains the Bel Fuse Inc. Employees’ Savings Plan, a defined contribution plan that is intended to meet the applicable requirements for tax-qualification under sections 401(a) and (k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $0.3 million in both periods. The expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $0.8 million in both periods. The Company’s matching contribution is made in the form of Bel Fuse Inc. Class A common stock. As of September 30, 2019, the plan owned 153,352 and 109,442 shares of Bel Fuse Inc. Class A and Class B common stock, respectively. 

The Company's subsidiaries in Asia have a retirement fund covering substantially all of their Hong Kong based full-time employees. The expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $0.1 million in both periods. The expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $0.3 million in both periods. As of September 30, 2019, the plan owned 3,323 and 17,342 shares of Bel Fuse Inc. Class A and Class B common stock, respectively. 

The Company maintains a SERP, which is designed to provide a limited group of key management and other key employees of the Company with supplemental retirement and death benefits. As discussed in Note 4 above, the Company has investments in a rabbi trust which are intended to fund the obligations of the SERP.

  12.   ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS    



Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 are as follows. All amounts are net of tax. 




The Company has operating leases for its facilities used for manufacturing, research and development, sales and administration. There are also operating and finance leases related to manufacturing equipment, office equipment and vehicles. These leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year to 8 years. Certain of the leases contain options to extend the term of the lease and certain of the leases contain options to terminate the lease within a specified period of time. These options to extend or terminate a lease are included in the lease term only when it is reasonably likely that the Company will elect that option. The Company is not a party to any material sublease arrangements.

Our discount rate is based on our incremental borrowing rate, as adjusted based on the geographic regions in which our leases assets are located. 



As of September 30, 2019, the Company did not have any additional operating or financing leases that have not yet commenced.  

  14.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    

Legal Proceedings 

The Company is party to a number of legal actions and claims, none of which individually or in the aggregate, in the opinion of management, are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position. 

In connection with the acquisition of Power Solutions, there is an ongoing claim by the Arezzo Revenue Agency in Italy concerning certain tax matters related to what was then Power-One Asia Pacific Electronics Shenzhen Co. Ltd. (now Bel Power Solutions Asia Pacific Electronics Shenzhen Co. Ltd, or “BPS China”) for the years 2004 to 2006. In September 2012, the Tax Court of Arezzo ruled in favor of BPS China and cancelled the claim. In February 2013, the Arezzo Revenue Agency filed an appeal of the Tax Court’s ruling. The hearing of the appeal was held on October 2, 2014. On October 13, 2014, BPS China was informed of the Regional Tax Commission of Florence ruling which was in favor of the Arezzo Revenue Agency and against BPS China. An appeal was filed on July 18, 2015 before the Regional Tax Commission of Florence and rejected. On December 5, 2016, the Arezzo Revenue Agency filed an appeal with the Supreme Court and BPS China filed a counter-appeal on January 4, 2017. The Supreme Court has yet to render its judgment. The estimated liability related to this matter is approximately $12.0 million and has been included as a liability for uncertain tax positions on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As Bel is fully indemnified in this matter per the terms of the stock purchase agreement with ABB, a corresponding other asset for indemnification is also included in other assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 

The Company is not a party to any other legal proceeding, the adverse outcome of which is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Net Sales – Segment net sales are attributed to individual segments based on the geographic source of the billing for such customer sales. Intercompany sales include finished products manufactured in foreign countries which are then transferred to the United States and Europe for sale; finished goods manufactured in the United States which are transferred to Europe and Asia for sale; and semi-finished components manufactured in the United States which are sold to Asia for further processing. 

Goodwill Impairment - As discussed in Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, the Company recorded an $8.9 million non-cash impairment charge related to its North America goodwill in the third quarter of 2019. This charge impacted income from operations for the North America segment in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The information in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes set forth in Item 1 of Part I of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our MD&A set forth in Item 7 of Part II of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in Item 8 of Part II of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” below and “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information,” above, and the information referenced therein, for a description of risks that we face and important factors that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding and all dollars in the text are in millions, except per share amounts or where otherwise noted. When we cross-reference to a “Note,” we are referring to our “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,” unless the context indicates otherwise. All amounts noted within the tables are in thousands and amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding. 

 Overview 

Our Company 

We design, manufacture and market a broad array of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits. These products are primarily used in the networking, telecommunications, computing, military, aerospace, transportation and broadcasting industries. Bel’s portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive, medical and consumer electronics markets. 


Our operating expenses are driven principally by the cost of labor where the factories that Bel uses are located, the cost of the materials that we use and our ability to effectively and efficiently manage overhead costs. As labor and material costs vary by product line and region, any significant shift in product mix can have an associated impact on our costs of sales. Costs are recorded as incurred for all products manufactured. Such amounts are determined based upon the estimated stage of production and include labor cost and fringes and related allocations of factory overhead. Our products are manufactured at various facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Dominican Republic, England, Czech Republic, Slovakia and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). 

We have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and we can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products. Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition and be able to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time. These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, and overtime required in order to meet any increase in demand, can add volatility to the labor costs incurred by us. 

Key Factors Affecting our Business 




    •   Product Mix – Material and labor costs vary by product line and any significant shift in product mix between higher- and lower-margin product lines will have a corresponding impact on the Company’s gross margin percentage. In general, our connectivity products have the highest contribution margins, our magnetic products are more labor intensive and are therefore less profitable than the connectivity products and our power products are on the lower end of our profit margin range, due to their high material content. Fluctuations in sales volume among our product groups will have a corresponding impact on Bel’s profit margins.    


Table of Contents  





    •   Effective Tax Rate – The Company’s effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic segment in which our pretax profits are earned. Of the geographic segments in which we operate, the U.S. and Europe’s tax rates are generally equivalent; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company’s three geographical segments. See Note 10, “Income Taxes”.    

After record bookings throughout 2018, the Company has experienced slower bookings during the first nine months of 2019 as customers work through their inventory on hand. The Company has also experienced margin pressure throughout 2019 due to lower sales volumes and high material costs from 2018 which continue to run through the Company’s statement of operations. As a result of these ongoing factors, the Company expects the balance of 2019 to remain challenging from both a sales and margin perspective. The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement. See “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information.” 

Summary by Operating Segment 




Table of Contents  

Sales declines in each of our segments during the third quarter of 2019 reflected lower sales into our distribution channel as our distribution partners continue to work down their level of inventory on hand. Sales of our connector products into military applications were also lower during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018, impacting our North America segment sales. Sales in our Asia segment in the third quarter of 2019 were down versus 2018 as a result of customers working down heightened inventory levels which had been built up during 2018 in response to new product launches and the tariffs that went into effect in 2018 and 2019. 

Net sales and (loss) income from operations by operating segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows. Segment net sales are attributed to individual segments based on the geographic source of the billing for customer sales.

Sales of our Connectivity Solutions products during the third quarter of 2019 declined $4.0 million primarily due to lower demand from military customers as compared to last year's third quarter, and reduced volume of product flowing through our distribution channels as our distribution partners continue to work down inventory levels that had been built up in 2018 ahead of the tariffs. These factors also impacted the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019, which declined $8.9 million from the same period of 2018, partially offset by higher sales to commercial aerospace customers during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Sales of our Magnetic Solutions products during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were down $13.3 million and $18.0 million, respectively, from the same periods of 2018 while inventory levels built up in advance of a customer's new program launch during 2018 are worked through. 


Sales of our Power Solutions and Protection products were $4.7 million lower in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter of 2018. Sales of our Bel Power Solutions products into datacenter applications decreased by $3.8 million and sales of our Circuit Protection products were $0.9 million lower as compared to last year’s third quarter. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in sales of our Custom Module products. Sales during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $1.2 million from the same period of 2018, as stronger sales into datacenter applications during the first quarter of 2019 lessened the impact of sales declines during the second and third quarters of 2019. 

Cost of Sales 



Material costs as a percentage of sales were higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods of 2018 primarily due to the industry-wide supply constraints related to certain of our purchased components during 2018. The finished goods shipped during the third quarter of 2019 still contained some of the higher-cost raw material components. 

Labor costs as a percentage of sales declined during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods of 2018 as a more favorable exchange rate environment related to the Chinese Renminbi offset the overall impact of minimum wage increases in the PRC and Mexico. The PRC government increased the minimum wage in the regions where Bel’s factories are located in February and July of 2018. The minimum wage rates in Mexico increased effective January 1, 2019. 


The other expenses noted in the table above include fixed cost items such as support labor and fringe, depreciation and amortization, and facility costs (rent, utilities, insurance). In total, these other expenses decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 by $2.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2018, primarily due to lower support labor and fringe expense and a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense in the 2019 periods.

Provision for Income Taxes 

The Company’s effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic segment in which the pretax profits are earned. Of the geographic segments in which the Company operates, the U.S. and Europe’s tax rates are generally equivalent; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company’s three geographical segments. See Note 10, “Income Taxes”. 

The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $0.6 million and ($2.2) million, respectively. The Company’s earnings before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2019, were approximately $15.1 million lower than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to the $8.9 million impairment of goodwill in North America, as well as lower earnings in the North America and Asia segments. The Company’s effective tax rate was (10.0%) and (24.1%) for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, is primarily attributable to a decrease in U.S. taxes relating to income from foreign subsidiaries taxed in the U.S. as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, the change in the tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is attributable to a decrease in tax expense in the North America segment due to the reduction in the estimated transition tax on post-1986 untaxed accumulated foreign earnings as well as a decrease in the taxes related to uncertain tax positions during the 2018 period. See Note 10, “Income Taxes.” 

The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The Company’s earnings before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were approximately $18.5 million lower than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to the $8.9 million impairment of goodwill in North America, as well as lower earnings in the North America and Asia segments. The Company’s effective tax rate was (78.2%) and 3.0% for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018, is primarily attributable to the same factors noted above related to the third quarter, as well as the impact from permanent tax differences on U.S. tax-exempt activities during the first quarter of 2019. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit, including our credit facility. Our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses, investments in working capital, capital expenditures, interest, taxes, dividends, debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. We believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations, including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months. 

At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $25.2 million and $46.3 million, respectively (or 39% and 86%, respectively), of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries of the Company. During the first nine months of 2019, the Company repatriated $29.3 million of funds from outside of the U.S., with minimal incremental tax liability. We continue to analyze our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to further repatriation, and we have yet to make any further determination regarding repatriation of funds from outside the U.S. to fund the Company’s U.S. operations in the future. In the event these funds were needed for Bel’s U.S. operations, the Company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. state taxes and any applicable foreign withholding taxes to repatriate these funds. 

Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable comprised approximately 33.1% of the Company’s total assets at September 30, 2019 and 32.9% of total assets at December 31, 2018. The Company’s current ratio (i.e., the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 3.2 to 1 at September 30, 2019 and 2.7 to 1 at December 31, 2018. 

In June 2014, the Company entered into a senior Credit and Security Agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2016, and further amended and refinanced in December 2017. The Credit and Security Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined (“Leverage Ratio”), and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA to the Company’s consolidated fixed charges (“Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio”). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit and Security Agreement would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. The unused credit available under the credit facility at September 30, 2019 was $75.0 million, of which we had the ability to borrow $40.6 million without violating our Leverage Ratio covenant based on the Company’s existing consolidated EBITDA.

Cash Flows 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 


   •  net cash provided by operating activities of $18.9 million; partially offset by    

   •  purchases of property, plant and equipment of $8.2 million;    

   •  dividend payments of $2.4 million; and    

   •  repayments of long-term debt of $2.2 million    

During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, accounts receivable decreased by $12.4 million primarily due to lower sales during the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased slightly to 58 days at September 30, 2019 from 59 days at December 31, 2018. Inventory decreased by $8.4 million at September 30, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. Inventory turns were 3.7 at each of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 


   •  purchases of property, plant and equipment of $8.8 million;    

   •  repayments of long-term debt of $8.3 million; and    

   •  dividend payments of $2.4 million; partially offset by    

   •  net cash provided by operations of $4.2 million.    

During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, accounts receivable increased by $19.0 million primarily due to higher sales volume in the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 61 days at September 30, 2018 from 60 days at December 31, 2017. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company implemented a change in the timing of revenue recognition (and related release of inventory from our books) in connection with the adoption of ASC 606. Excluding the adoption adjustment related to this accounting change, inventory increased by $20.1 million at September 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily in raw materials. The increased raw materials balance was driven by a higher volume of raw materials purchased to accommodate increased demand for our products, coupled with higher material costs in 2018 resulting from constraints in component availability. Inventory turns increased from 3.6 at December 31, 2017 to 4.0 at September 30, 2018, primarily due to the change in revenue recognition accounting noted above. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Management’s discussion and analysis of Bel’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, warranties, SERP expense, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

The Company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates associated with its long-term debt. During the first nine months of 2019, the U.S. Dollar was stronger against most other currencies in which the Company pays its expenses. In comparing average exchange rates during the first nine months of 2019 versus those during the same period of 2018, the Euro depreciated by 6%, the Pound depreciated by 6%, the Peso depreciated by 1% and the Renminbi depreciated by 5% against the U.S. Dollar. The Company estimates that the depreciation in these foreign currencies led to lower operating costs of $3.9 million, as the majority of our expenses in the PRC, Europe and Mexico are paid in local currency. Foreign exchange gains were also recognized in the first nine months of 2019 of $0.5 million on translation of local currency balance sheet accounts to the U.S. Dollar in consolidation, resulting from foreign currency fluctuations since December 31, 2018. Refer to Item 7A, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for further discussion of market risks.
