REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors


Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 

We have reviewed the condensed consolidated balance sheet of CA, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2018, the related condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the related condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of March 31, 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated May 9, 2018, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2018, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Basis for Review Results

This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 – ACCOUNTING POLICIES


The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 270, for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and therefore should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 (“2018 Form 10-K”). In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on management’s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results.

Operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.


At June 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the total amount of restricted cash included in “Other noncurrent assets, net” in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was approximately $1 million and $2 million, respectively. Restricted cash was included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts shown in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.


New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, with amendments in 2015, 2016 and 2017, creating new ASC Topic 606 (“Topic 606”) that replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. Topic 606 was adopted by the Company effective April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Reporting periods prior to the adoption of Topic 606 were presented in accordance with ASC Topic 605 (“Topic 605”). As a result of adopting Topic 606, the Company now recognizes revenue for the license component of all its on-premise software arrangements at the point-in-time control of the software license is transferred to the customer, rather than ratably over the term of the contract. The Company reflected the impact of the changes at transition with a cumulative increase of approximately $2,104 million to the opening balance of retained earnings. Refer to Note 2, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” and Note 3, “Impact of Adopting Topic 606,” for a discussion of the changes in the Company’s policies for revenue recognition and commissions, and the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting Topic 606. Refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for policies in accordance with Topic 605.

In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16 (“ASU 2016-16”), Intra-Equity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (Topic 740), which is intended to eliminate diversity in practice and provide a more accurate depiction of the tax consequences on intercompany asset transfers (excluding inventory). ASU 2016-16 requires entities to immediately recognize the tax consequences on intercompany asset transfers (excluding inventory) at the transaction date, rather than deferring the tax consequences under current GAAP. ASU 2016-16 was adopted by the Company when effective in first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (“ASU 2016-02”), Leases (Topic 842), with amendments in 2018, requiring a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet for leases with accounting lease terms of more than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 will replace most existing lease accounting guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard states that a lessee will recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the consolidated statements of operations. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company’s first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and requires the modified retrospective method of adoption, with an option to recognize the cumulative effect of applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 when effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Although the Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, the Company currently expects that most of its operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption.

In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04 (“ASU 2017-04”), Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (Topic 350), which is intended to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test requiring the assessment of fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairments. Upon adoption of this new standard, goodwill impairments will be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value. ASU 2017-04 will be effective for the Company’s first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and requires a prospective method of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. Although the Company is currently evaluating the timing of adoption of ASU 2017-04, it does not currently expect the adoption to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-12 (“ASU 2017-12”), Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (Topic 815), which is intended to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of risk management activities in financial statements. ASU 2017-12 makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current GAAP. ASU 2017-12 will be effective for the Company’s first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and requires a prospective method of adoption for the amended presentation and disclosure guidance. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the timing of adoption and the effect that ASU 2017-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In February 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-02 (“ASU 2018-02”), Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), which allows stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Act”) to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. Since ASU 2018-02 only relates to the income tax effects from the Tax Act, the underlying guidance that requires the effects from changes in tax laws or rates be included in income from continuing operations is not affected. ASU 2018-02 will be effective for the Company’s first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Early adoption is permitted. Although the Company is currently evaluating the timing of adoption of ASU 2018-02, it does not currently expect the adoption to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

NOTE 2 – REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

In accordance with Topic 606, the Company accounts for a customer contract when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations, each party’s rights can be identified, payment terms can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable the Company will collect substantially all of the consideration to which it is entitled. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer.

A. Nature of products and services

The Company’s products and services can be broadly categorized as perpetual licenses to use software, term-based licenses for Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) and on-premise use of software, maintenance for perpetual and term-based on-premise licenses, and professional services. The Company’s software licenses and maintenance are for mainframe, enterprise, and SaaS computing environments.







Material rights

Contracts with customers may include material rights which are also performance obligations. Material rights primarily arise when the contract gives the customer the right to renew or receive products or services at a discounted price in the future. Revenue allocated to material rights is recognized when the customer exercises the right or the right expires. If exercised by the customer, revenue is classified consistent with the products or services obtained through the exercise of the right. If expired, revenue is classified consistent with the products or services in the contract that gave rise to the material right.

CA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Arrangements with multiple performance obligations

The Company’s contracts generally contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation.


If the arrangement contains professional services and other products or services, the Company first allocates to the professional service obligation a portion of the total contract consideration equal to the standalone selling price of professional services that is observed from consistently priced standalone sales. The Company allocates the remaining consideration among the other products and services in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis.

The standalone selling price for perpetual and on-premise term licenses, which are always sold with maintenance, is the price for the combined license and maintenance bundle. The amount assigned to the license and maintenance bundle is separated into license and maintenance amounts using the respective standalone selling prices represented by the value relationship between the software license and maintenance.

When two or more contracts are entered into at or near the same time with the same customer, the Company evaluates the facts and circumstances associated with the negotiation of those contracts. Where the contracts are negotiated as a package, the Company will account for them as a single arrangement and allocate the consideration for the combined contracts among the performance obligations accordingly.


The value relationship the Company uses to allocate consideration between the license and maintenance performance obligations is derived from the observable relationship of the selling price of a standalone perpetual license maintenance renewal to the related perpetual license fee, which is generally 20% of the net license fee for one year of maintenance. The Company separates the license and maintenance performance obligations of a term license and maintenance bundle using the same observable value relationship as in a perpetual license and maintenance bundle because the nature of the maintenance performance obligation and its value relationship with the right to use the software were determined to be similar.

Arrangements that include a software license sold with more than one year of maintenance for the license use a value relationship which reflects an annual maintenance rate of 20% of the total value ascribed to the right to use the software. As a result, a greater portion of the bundle relates to maintenance as the length of the maintenance period included in the bundle increases.

The Company separately determines the standalone selling prices by geographic region, distribution channel and by volume when the pricing strategies include volume purchase discounts.

The Company also estimates the standalone selling prices of its material rights, which primarily include contractually stated amounts that the customer can use to acquire additional products and services. The Company estimates the value of these rights by considering the stated amount and the likelihood of the customer exercising its right. In addition, an option to purchase or receive additional products or services at a discounted price is estimated as the incremental discount the customer would obtain when exercising the option and the likelihood that the option would be exercised.

Other policies and judgments

Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days of the invoice. In certain arrangements, the Company receives payment from a customer either before or after the performance obligation has been satisfied, however, the Company’s contracts generally do not contain a significant financing component.

The Company may modify contracts to offer customers additional products or services. The additional products and services will generally be considered distinct from those products or services transferred to the customer before the modification and will generally be accounted for as a separate contract. The Company evaluates whether the price for the additional products and services reflects the standalone selling price adjusted as appropriate for facts and circumstances applicable to that contract. In determining whether an adjustment is appropriate, the Company evaluates whether the incremental consideration is consistent with the prices previously paid by the customer or similar customers.

The Company reduces transaction price for an estimate of returns that is based on historical data.

B. Disaggregation




C. Contract Balances



The difference in the opening and closing balances of the Company’s contract assets and deferred revenue primarily results from the timing difference between the Company’s performance and the customer’s payment. The Company fulfills its obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring products and services in exchange for consideration from the customer. The Company recognizes a contract asset when it transfers products or services to a customer and the right to consideration is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Accounts receivable are recorded when the customer has been billed or the right to consideration is unconditional. The Company recognizes deferred revenue when it has received consideration or an amount of consideration is due from the customer and the Company has a future obligation to transfer products or services. Deferred revenue includes amounts billed or collected and advanced payments on contracts which may include termination for convenience clauses. The amount of revenue recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2018 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at April 1, 2018 was $434 million.

CA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

D. Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations

The following table discloses the aggregate amount of the transaction price and advanced payments allocated to remaining performance obligations as of the end of the reporting period, and when the Company expects to recognize the revenue.


The Company’s multi-year contracts with government customers may have termination for convenience clauses. Approximately $88 million of advanced payments received from government customers that have termination for convenience rights are included in “Deferred revenue and advanced payments” in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and allocated to the remaining performance obligations in the table above. In addition, approximately $561 million related to the remaining unbilled contract value and performance obligations in these contracts with termination for convenience clauses are not included in the allocation of transaction price and not included in “Deferred revenue and advanced payments” in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

E. Contract Costs

The Company pays commissions for new product sales as well as for renewals of existing contracts. Commissions paid to obtain renewal contracts are not commensurate with the commissions paid for new product sales and therefore, a portion of the commissions paid for new contracts relate to future renewals.

The Company accounts for commissions using a portfolio approach and allocates the cost of commissions in proportion to the allocation of transaction price of license and maintenance performance obligations, including assumed renewals. Commissions allocated to the license and license renewal components are expensed at the time the license revenue is recognized. Commissions allocated to maintenance are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of seven years for new contracts, reflecting the Company’s estimate of the expected period that the Company will benefit from those commissions. Commissions paid on renewal contracts that are allocated to maintenance are capitalized and amortized over the renewal term of approximately three years. Service contracts are generally less than one year and accordingly, as a practical expedient, commissions paid for service contracts are expensed as incurred.

Amortization of capitalized contract costs is included in “Selling and marketing” expenses in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The amount of amortization for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was $30 million, and there was no impairment loss in relation to the costs capitalized.

NOTE 3 – IMPACT OF ADOPTING TOPIC 606



CA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In connection with the adoption of Topic 606, the Company increased its retained earnings by approximately $2,104 million. This increase was a result of a decrease in deferred revenue of approximately $1,358 million and the establishment of contract assets of approximately $931 million for amounts that would have been recognized under Topic 606 prior to April 1, 2018. In addition, upon adoption of Topic 606, the Company capitalized contract costs of approximately $427 million relating to commissions incurred to obtain customer contracts. Refer to Note 2 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” for additional details on contract costs.

The net change in deferred income taxes of approximately $301 million and income tax payables of approximately $280 million is primarily due to the current and deferred tax effects resulting from the aforementioned items.

In addition, the Company made other changes, primarily due to professional services, to our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet on April 1, 2018 to comply with Topic 606.

NOTE 4 – RESTRUCTURING

On May 2, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a restructuring plan (“Fiscal 2019 Plan”) to better align its business priorities. The Fiscal 2019 Plan comprises the termination of approximately 800 employees and global facility exits and consolidations. The Company intends to fill many of the positions involved in the Fiscal 2019 Plan with new employees who have different skill sets. These actions are intended to better align the Company’s cost structure with the skills and resources required to more effectively pursue opportunities in the marketplace and execute the Company’s long-term growth strategy. Costs associated with the Fiscal 2019 Plan are presented in “Other expenses, net” in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. Severance and facility exit and consolidation actions under the Fiscal 2019 Plan are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2019. Under the Fiscal 2019 Plan, the Company expects to incur a pre-tax charge between approximately $140 million and $160 million (including severance costs between approximately $90 million and $100 million and facility exit and consolidation costs between approximately $50 million and $60 million).

CA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



The balance at June 30, 2018 includes facility exit accruals of approximately $7 million for plans and actions prior to the Fiscal 2019 Plan.

The severance liabilities are included in “Accrued salaries, wages and commissions” in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The facility exit liabilities are included in “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” and “Other noncurrent liabilities” in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NOTE 5 – GOODWILL, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS





CA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



The Company evaluates the useful lives and recoverability of capitalized software and other intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. These evaluations require complex assumptions about key factors such as future customer demand, technology trends and the impact of those factors on the technology the Company acquires and develops for its products. Impairments or revisions to useful lives could result from the use of alternative assumptions that reflect reasonably possible outcomes related to future customer demand or technology trends for assets within the Enterprise Solutions segment.



NOTE 6 – DERIVATIVES

The Company is exposed to financial market risks arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Changes in interest rates could affect the Company’s monetary assets and liabilities, and foreign exchange rate changes could affect the Company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions. The Company enters into derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating a portion of these risks.


At June 30, 2018, foreign currency contracts outstanding consisted of purchase and sale contracts with a total gross notional value of approximately $933 million and durations of less than nine months. The net fair value of these contracts at June 30, 2018 was a net asset of approximately $13 million, of which approximately $21 million was included in “Other current assets” and approximately $8 million was included in “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

At March 31, 2018, foreign currency contracts outstanding consisted of purchase and sale contracts with a total gross notional value of approximately $456 million and durations of less than three months. The net fair value of these contracts at March 31, 2018 was a net asset of approximately $1 million, of which approximately $2 million was included in “Other current assets” and approximately $1 million was included in “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

NOTE 8 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company, from time to time, may be named as a defendant in various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business. The Company may also become involved with contract issues and disputes with customers.


Based on the Company’s experience, management believes that the damages amounts claimed in a case are not a meaningful indicator of the potential liability. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of cases. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses in connection with its current lawsuits and material claims and disputes, and intends to vigorously contest each of them.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 10 – INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

Basic net income per common share excludes dilution and is calculated by dividing net income allocable to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per common share is calculated by dividing net income allocable to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares, as adjusted for the potential dilutive effect of non-participating share-based awards.



For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, approximately 1 million shares and 2 million shares of Company common stock underlying restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) and options to purchase common stock were excluded from the calculation because their effect on income per share was anti-dilutive during the respective periods. Weighted average RSAs of approximately 5 million shares and 5 million shares for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were considered participating securities in the calculation of net income allocable to common stockholders.

NOTE 12 – INCOME TAXES

Income tax benefit for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was approximately $84 million compared with income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2017 of approximately $60 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded a net discrete tax benefit of approximately $98 million resulting primarily from refinements to the provisional estimates of the impact of changes in tax law in the United States resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act. For the three months ended June 30, 2017, the Company recorded a net discrete tax benefit of approximately $8 million resulting primarily from reductions in uncertain tax positions related to effectively settled tax audits.

The cumulative expense recorded for the impacts of the Tax Act are provisional amounts of approximately $192 million in total, including expense of approximately $198 million related to the taxation of unremitted earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, which is payable over eight years, partially offset by a benefit of approximately $102 million related to a dividends received deduction for certain foreign tax credits relating to the fiscal 2018 year calculation of taxation of unremitted earnings, and expense of approximately $96 million related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in income tax rates. The Company will continue to refine the provisional amounts as it reviews and analyzes the historic unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, as well as the attendant computations that impact the measurement of the taxation of unremitted earnings, and also takes into consideration any additional regulatory guidance published by the U.S. tax authorities in respect of the Tax Act. The Company expects to finalize the tax expense as soon as practical, but not later than the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. The $102 million tax benefit for the dividends received deduction was based on the Company’s assessment of the treatment under the provisions of the Tax Act. Congress or the Department of Treasury may provide legislative or regulatory updates which would change the Company’s assessment. If legislative or regulatory updates are issued related to this item, the timing of which is uncertain, the Company may be required to recognize additional tax expense up to the full amount of the $102 million in the period such updates are issued.

Excluding the impact of discrete items for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s estimated annual effective tax rate was 20.9% and 28.6%, respectively. The reduction in the Company’s estimated annual effective tax rate is primarily resulting from the Tax Act which provided for a lower statutory tax rate in the United States. Changes in tax laws, the outcome of tax audits and any other changes in potential tax liabilities may result in additional tax expense or benefit in fiscal year 2019, which are not considered in the Company’s estimated annual effective tax rate. While the Company does not currently view any such items as individually material to the results of the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations, the impact of certain items may yield additional tax expense or benefit in the remaining quarters of fiscal year 2019.

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, the Company disaggregates its operations into Mainframe Solutions, Enterprise Solutions and Services segments, which is utilized by the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer, for evaluating segment performance and allocating resources.

The Company’s Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments are comprised of its software business organized by the nature of the Company’s software offerings and the platforms on which the products operate. The Services segment is comprised of product implementation, consulting, customer education and customer training services, including those directly related to the Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions software that the Company sells to its customers.

The Company regularly enters into a single arrangement with a customer that includes mainframe solutions, enterprise solutions and services. The amount of contract revenue assigned to operating segments is generally based on the manner in which the proposal is made to the customer. The software product revenue assigned to the Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments is based on either (1) a list price allocation method (which allocates a discount in the total contract price to the individual products in proportion to the list price of the products); (2) allocations included within internal contract approval documents; or (3) the value for individual software products as stated in the customer contract. The price for the implementation, consulting, education and training services is separately stated in the contract and these amounts of contract revenue are assigned to the Services segment. The contract value assigned to each operating segment is then recognized in a manner consistent with the revenue recognition policies of the Company prior to the adoption of Topic 606. Accordingly, differences in segment revenue and consolidated revenue arise primarily from (a) term and perpetual software licenses that are recognized ratably under the Company’s segment policies and in its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for periods prior to the adoption of Topic 606 that, after adoption of Topic 606, are recognized at a point-in-time; and (b) differences in the allocations of contract value among products and services in a contract arising from the use of a relative standalone selling price allocation method in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for periods after adoption of Topic 606 as compared to the aforementioned approach to assigning contract value to the Company’s segments.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Segment expenses include costs that are controllable by segment managers (i.e., direct costs) and, in the case of the Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments, an allocation of shared and indirect costs (i.e., allocated costs). Segment-specific direct costs include a portion of selling and marketing costs, licensing and maintenance costs, product development costs and general and administrative costs. Allocated segment costs primarily include indirect and non-segment-specific direct selling and marketing costs and general and administrative costs that are not directly attributable to a specific segment. The basis for allocating shared and indirect costs between the Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments is dependent on the nature of the cost being allocated and is generally either in proportion to segment revenues or in proportion to the related direct cost category. Expenses for the Services segment consist of cost of professional services and other direct costs included within selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses. There are no allocated or indirect costs for the Services segment.

Segment expenses do not include amortization of purchased software, amortization of other intangible assets, amortization of internally developed software products, share-based compensation expense, certain foreign exchange derivative hedging gains and losses, severance and facility actions approved by the Board, and other miscellaneous costs. A measure of segment assets is not currently provided to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and has therefore not been disclosed.

To achieve this, we have built a portfolio of solutions that enable customers to leverage the benefits of agility, automation, insights and security in managing business processes and technology investments. Customers are transforming their businesses to better manage the market demands for speed, exceptional customer experience and rich analytics. We believe this journey, broadly referred to as digital transformation, is fueled by software.



•Our Services segment helps customers reach their information technology (“IT”) and business goals primarily by enabling the rapid implementation and adoption of our software solutions. Our Services team consists of experienced professionals who provide a variety of services, such as consulting, implementation, application management services, education and support services, to both commercial and government customers.

Our segments strengthen each other in several ways. Our customers benefit from the ability of CA solutions to span their entire infrastructure stack, across mobile, cloud, distributed, and mainframe. This is critical as customers focus on their end users’ experiences on their apps and the underlying transactions that traverse their heterogeneous environments. CA is one of the few companies positioned to deliver solutions that span mobile, cloud, open systems and mainframe environments. This hybrid cloud capability helps customers remove the barriers between ideas and business outcomes.

Our strong market position enables our investment in development, innovation and support of the mainframe platform to be among the largest in the industry, which sustains ongoing customer commitment to our Mainframe Solutions. Our Services segment leverages our expertise across our Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments and helps customers deploy and maintain our solutions.


Agile


•Agile Planning helps customers transform their development practices from traditional to modern agile methodologies. Agile development utilizes an iterative work cadence with a feedback loop that decreases time-to-market, increases product quality and, most importantly, maintains a focus on generating rapid business value. CA’s cloud-based solutions in this space help customers to collaboratively plan, prioritize and track agile software development at scale.


DevOps


•Continuous Delivery optimizes the application development processes by automating the deployment of applications across all stages of their lifecycles. Continuous delivery is key to transforming the technical aspects of software delivery. Our solutions enable the development, testing and release teams to work concurrently and continuously to remove the excess overhead and delays that come with traditional software development.

•Automation solutions help customers transform business processes. They automate, orchestrate and accelerate the entire application delivery process. Our unified platform provides end-to-end automation capabilities that cover service orchestration, workload automation and release automation capabilities.

•Agile Operations helps customers correlate end-user, application and infrastructure data from cloud-hosted containers to mainframes.

We also focus on organically developing nascent technologies from companies we have acquired to provide them with the necessary interoperability, resilience and security to operate at scale in the large, heterogeneous IT environments utilized by our customers.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, with amendments in 2015, 2016 and 2017, which creates new ASC Topic 606 (“Topic 606”) that replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. Topic 606 was adopted by us effective April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Reporting periods prior to the adoption of Topic 606 were presented in accordance with ASC Topic 605 (“Topic 605”). As a result of adopting Topic 606, we now recognize revenue for the license component of all our on-premise software arrangements at the point-in-time control of the software license is transferred to the customer, rather than ratably over the term of the contract.

Refer to Note 2, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” and Note 3, “Impact of Adopting Topic 606,” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the changes in our policies for revenue recognition and commissions, and the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting Topic 606. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for policies in accordance with Topic 605.


Revenue

•Total revenue decreased due to the adoption of Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. On a Topic 605 basis, total revenue increased $27 million primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange effect of $20 million. Excluding the favorable foreign exchange effect, total revenue increased primarily due to an increase in Mainframe Solutions revenue and SaaS revenue within our Enterprise Solutions segment.

Expenses

•Under both Topic 606 and Topic 605, operating expenses increased primarily due to an increase in other expenses, net attributable to the restructuring plan approved by our Board of Directors on May 2, 2018 (“Fiscal 2019 Plan”). This increase was partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing expenses.

Income taxes

•Under both Topic 606 and Topic 605, income tax benefit includes $98 million resulting primarily from refinements to the provisional estimates of the impact of changes in tax law in the United States resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Act”).


Segment results

•Mainframe Solutions revenue increased primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange effect of $10 million and, to a lesser extent, an increase in revenue from new sales that offset the decline in revenue contribution from renewals. Mainframe Solutions operating margin increased primarily due to an increase in Mainframe Solutions revenue.

•Enterprise Solutions revenue increased primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange effect of $8 million. Excluding the favorable foreign exchange effect, Enterprise Solutions revenue increased primarily due to an increase in SaaS revenue, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from our Enterprise Solutions products recognized on an upfront basis. Enterprise Solutions operating margin increased primarily due to lower acquisition-related costs and an increase in Enterprise Solutions revenue.

•Services revenue decreased slightly primarily due to a decline in professional services engagements. The decline in professional services engagements was a result of several factors including our products being easier to install and manage, and an increase in customers’ use of partners for services engagements. Operating margin for Services was generally consistent.


PERFORMANCE INDICATORS





RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In May 2014, the FASB issued Topic 606 that replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. Topic 606 was adopted by us effective April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Reporting periods prior to the adoption of Topic 606 were presented in accordance with Topic 605. As a result of adopting Topic 606, we now recognize revenue for the license component of all our on-premise software arrangements at the point-in-time control of the software license is transferred to the customer, rather than ratably over the term of the contract. 

Refer to Note 2, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” and Note 3, “Impact of Adopting Topic 606,” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the changes in our policies for revenue recognition and commissions, and the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting Topic 606. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for policies in accordance with Topic 605.

The following table presents revenue and expense line items reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, both as reported under Topic 606 and Topic 605, and for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as reported under Topic 605, and the period-over-period dollar and percentage changes for those line items. These comparisons of past results are not necessarily indicative of future results.





Revenue

Total Revenue

Total revenue is the amount of revenue recognized during the reporting period from the sale of products and services. Our products and services can be broadly categorized as perpetual licenses to use software, term-based licenses for SaaS and on-premise use of software, maintenance for perpetual and term-based on-premise licenses, and professional services. Our software licenses and maintenance are for mainframe, enterprise, and SaaS computing environments. Refer to Note 2, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the adoption of Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact from the adoption of Topic 606 of $114 million, total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $27 million compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange effect of $20 million. Excluding the favorable foreign exchange effect, total revenue increased due to an increase in software licenses and maintenance revenue as discussed below.

With the adoption of Topic 606, our revenue results will be highly dependent on total bookings. Total bookings, or sales, includes the incremental value of all product and professional services contracts entered into during the reporting period and is generally reflective of the amount of products and services during the period that our customers have agreed to purchase from us. For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, total bookings were $778 million. Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was based on Topic 605, which generally consisted of a majority of our revenue being recognized ratably over the term of our contracts and, as such, total bookings had a lower effect on our quarterly revenue performance.


Software Licenses and Maintenance

Software licenses and maintenance revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the adoption of Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact from the adoption of Topic 606 of $108 million, software licenses and maintenance revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $28 million compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange effect of $18 million. Excluding the favorable foreign exchange effect, software licenses and maintenance revenue increased primarily due to an increase in Mainframe Solutions revenue and SaaS revenue within our Enterprise Solutions segment.

Professional Services

Professional services revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to the adoption of Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact from the adoption of Topic 606 of $6 million, professional services revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased slightly compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a decline in professional services engagements. The decline in professional services engagements was a result of several factors, including our products being easier to install and manage and an increase in customers’ use of partners for services engagements. For the long term, we expect new versions of our on-premise software to be easier to implement and a higher percentage of our business to shift to a SaaS-based model, which could potentially reduce the demand for our professional services engagements.

Total Revenue by Geography

The following tables present the amount of revenue earned from sales to unaffiliated customers in the United States and international regions and corresponding percentage changes for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018.



Revenue in the United States for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the adoption of Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact from the adoption of Topic 606 of $91 million, revenue in the United States increased.

International revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the adoption of Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact from the adoption of Topic 606 of $23 million, international revenue increased primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange effect of $20 million.

Expenses

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase in other expenses, net attributable to the Fiscal 2019 Plan. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing expenses as discussed below.

Costs of Licensing and Maintenance

Costs of licensing and maintenance include technical support, royalties, SaaS, and other manufacturing and distribution costs. Costs of licensing and maintenance for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase in costs associated with our SaaS products.

Cost of Professional Services

Cost of professional services consists primarily of our personnel-related costs associated with providing professional services and training to customers. Cost of professional services for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the adoption of Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact from the adoption of Topic 606, cost of professional services for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was consistent compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

Operating margin for professional services for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to the adoption of Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Operating margin for professional services does not include certain additional direct costs that are included within the Services segment (refer to “Performance of Segments” below). Expenses for the Services segment consist of cost of professional services and other direct costs included within selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses.

Amortization of Capitalized Software Costs

Amortization of capitalized software costs consists of the amortization of both purchased software and internally generated capitalized software development costs. Internally generated capitalized software development costs relate to new products and significant enhancements to existing software products that have reached the technological feasibility stage.

Amortization of capitalized software costs for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a decrease in amortization of our internally developed software products and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in amortization expense associated with purchased software products. With our adoption of the Agile development methodology in fiscal 2014, amortization expense of internally developed software products has decreased as we have not capitalized any internally developed software costs.

Selling and Marketing

Selling and marketing expenses include the costs relating to our sales force, partners, corporate and business marketing and customer training programs. Selling and marketing expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to a decrease in personnel-related costs of $15 million resulting from lower headcount. Commissions expense was unfavorably affected by $10 million as a result of the adoption of Topic 606, which was caused by amortization expense from capitalized commission costs of $30 million, partially offset by $20 million of deferred commission costs. Refer to Note 2, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses include the costs of corporate functions, including our executive leadership and administration groups, finance, legal, human resources, corporate communications and other costs such as provisions for doubtful accounts. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related costs resulting from lower headcount.

Product Development and Enhancements

Product development and enhancements expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs resulting from higher headcount.

Depreciation and Amortization of Other Intangible Assets,

Depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets consists of both depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of other intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was consistent compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

Other Expenses, Net



On May 2, 2018, our Board of Directors approved the Fiscal 2019 Plan to better align its business priorities. The Fiscal 2019 Plan comprises the termination of approximately 800 employees and global facility exits and consolidations. Severance and facility exit and consolidation actions under the Fiscal 2019 Plan are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 4, “Restructuring,” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Interest Expense, Net

Interest expense, net for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from higher interest rates and cash balances in the United States.

Income Taxes

Income tax benefit for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $84 million compared with income tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $60 million. For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded a net discrete tax benefit of $98 million resulting primarily from refinements to the provisional estimates of the impact of changes in tax law in the United States resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act. For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a net discrete tax benefit of $8 million resulting primarily from reductions in uncertain tax positions related to effectively settled tax audits.

The cumulative expense recorded for the impacts of the Tax Act are provisional amounts of $192 million in total, including expense of $198 million related to the taxation of unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, which is payable over eight years, partially offset by a benefit of $102 million related to a dividends received deduction for certain foreign tax credits relating to the fiscal 2018 year calculation of taxation of unremitted earnings, and expense of $96 million related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in income tax rates. We will continue to refine the provisional amounts as we review and analyze the historic unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, as well as the attendant computations that impact the measurement of the taxation of unremitted earnings, and also take into consideration any additional regulatory guidance published by the U.S. tax authorities in respect of the Tax Act. We expect to finalize the tax expense as soon as practical, but not later than the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The $102 million tax benefit for the dividends received deduction was based on our assessment of the treatment under the provisions of the Tax Act. Congress or the Department of Treasury may provide legislative or regulatory updates which would change our assessment. If legislative or regulatory updates are issued related to this item, the timing of which is uncertain, we may be required to recognize additional tax expense up to the full amount of the $102 million in the period such updates are issued.

Excluding the impact of discrete items for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, our estimated annual effective tax rate was 20.9% and 28.6%, respectively. The reduction in our estimated annual effective tax rate is primarily resulting from the Tax Act which provided for a lower statutory tax rate in the United States. Changes in tax laws, the outcome of tax audits and any other changes in potential tax liabilities may result in additional tax expense or benefit in fiscal 2019, which are not considered in our estimated annual effective tax rate. While we do not currently view any such items as individually material to the results of our consolidated financial position or results of operations, the impact of certain items may yield additional tax expense or benefit in the remaining quarters of fiscal 2019.

Performance of Segments 

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, we disaggregate our operations into Mainframe Solutions, Enterprise Solutions and Services segments, which is utilized by the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, for evaluating segment performance and allocating resources.

Our Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments are comprised of our software business organized by the nature of our software offerings and the platforms on which the products operate. The Services segment is comprised of product implementation, consulting, customer education and customer training services, including those directly related to our Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions software that we sell to our customers.

We regularly enter into a single arrangement with a customer that includes mainframe solutions, enterprise solutions and services. The amount of contract revenue assigned to our operating segments is generally based on the manner in which the proposal is made to the customer. The software product revenue assigned to our Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments is based on either (1) a list price allocation method (which allocates a discount in the total contract price to the individual products in proportion to the list price of the products); (2) allocations included within internal contract approval documents; or (3) the value for individual software products as stated in the customer contract. The price for the implementation, consulting, education and training services is separately stated in the contract and these amounts of contract revenue are assigned to our Services segment. The contract value assigned to each operating segment is then recognized in a manner consistent with our revenue recognition policies prior to the adoption of Topic 606. Accordingly, differences in segment revenue and consolidated revenue arise primarily from (a) term and perpetual software licenses that are recognized ratably under our segment policies and in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for periods prior to the adoption of Topic 606 that, after adoption of Topic 606, are recognized at a point-in-time; and (b) differences in the allocations of contract value among products and services in a contract arising from the use of a relative standalone selling price allocation method in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for periods after adoption of Topic 606 as compared to the aforementioned approach to assigning contract value to our segments.

Segment expenses include costs that are controllable by segment managers (i.e., direct costs) and, in the case of our Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments, an allocation of shared and indirect costs (i.e., allocated costs). Segment-specific direct costs include a portion of selling and marketing costs, licensing and maintenance costs, product development costs and general and administrative costs. Allocated segment costs primarily include indirect and non-segment-specific direct selling and marketing costs and general and administrative costs that are not directly attributable to a specific segment. The basis for allocating shared and indirect costs between our Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments is dependent on the nature of the cost being allocated and is generally either in proportion to segment revenues or in proportion to the related direct cost category. Expenses for our Services segment consist of cost of professional services and other direct costs included within selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses. There are no allocated or indirect costs for our Services segment.

Segment expenses do not include amortization of purchased software, amortization of other intangible assets, amortization of internally developed software products, share-based compensation expense, certain foreign exchange derivative hedging gains and losses, severance and facility actions approved by our Board of Directors, and other miscellaneous costs. A measure of segment assets is not currently provided to our Chief Executive Officer and has therefore not been disclosed.



Mainframe Solutions revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange effect of $10 million and, to a lesser extent, an increase in revenue from new sales that offset the decline in revenue contribution from renewals. Mainframe Solutions operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase in Mainframe Solutions revenue.


Enterprise Solutions revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange effect of $8 million. Excluding the favorable foreign exchange effect, Enterprise Solutions revenue increased primarily due to an increase in SaaS revenue, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from our Enterprise Solutions products recognized on an upfront basis. Enterprise Solutions operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower acquisition-related costs and an increase in Enterprise Solutions revenue.


Services revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased slightly compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a decline in professional services engagements. The decline in professional services engagements was a result of several factors including our products being easier to install and manage, and an increase in customers’ use of partners for services engagements. For the long term, we expect new versions of our on-premise software to be easier to implement and a higher percentage of our business to shift to a SaaS-based model, which could potentially reduce the demand for our professional services engagements. Operating margin for Services for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was generally consistent compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with 48% held in our subsidiaries outside the United States at June 30, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $3,328 million at June 30, 2018, representing a decrease of $77 million from the March 31, 2018 balance of $3,405 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, there was a $104 million unfavorable translation effect from foreign exchange rates on cash held outside the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law. This new law includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate, limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system. This new law includes a provision that imposes a transition tax on foreign earnings whether or not such earnings are repatriated to the U.S. and resulted in our recognition of income tax expense of $198 million through the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 12, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

We continue to expect domestic cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowings to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and our investing and financing activities, including, among other things, the payment of regular quarterly dividends, compliance with our debt repayment schedules and the funding for capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. In addition, we continue to expect foreign cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from foreign operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and investing activities, including, among other things, the funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions and research and development, for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement with Broadcom, we may not continue to repurchase shares without Broadcom’s consent. Refer to Note 15, “Subsequent Events” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Under our subscription and maintenance agreements, customers generally make installment payments over the term of the agreement, often with at least one payment due at contract execution, for the right to use our software products and receive product support, software fixes and new products when available. The timing and actual amounts of cash received from committed customer installment payments under any specific agreement can be affected by several factors, including the time value of money and the customer’s credit rating. Often, the amount received is the result of direct negotiations with the customer when establishing pricing and payment terms. In certain instances, the customer negotiates a price for a single upfront installment payment and seeks its own internal or external financing sources. In other instances, we may assist the customer by arranging financing on the customer’s behalf through a third-party financial institution.

Amounts billed or collected as a result of a single installment for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, rather than being invoiced and collected over the life of the license agreement, are reflected in the liability section of our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Deferred revenue and advanced payments.” Amounts received from either a customer or a third-party financial institution that are attributable to later years of a license agreement have a positive impact on billings and cash provided by operating activities in the current period. Accordingly, to the extent these collections are attributable to the later years of a license agreement, billings and cash provided by operating activities during the license’s later years will be lower than if the payments were received over the license term. We are unable to predict with certainty the amount of cash to be collected from single installments for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, under new or renewed license agreements to be executed in future periods.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, gross receipts related to single installments for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, were $95 million, all of which was billed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, gross receipts related to single installments for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, were $194 million, of which $97 million was billed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.

In any quarter, we may receive payments in advance of the contractually committed date on which the payments were otherwise due. In limited circumstances, we may offer discounts to customers to ensure payment in the current period of invoices that have been billed, but might not otherwise be paid until a subsequent period because of payment terms. Historically, any such discounts have not been material.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities




First Quarter Comparison Fiscal 2019 Versus Fiscal 2018

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $262 million, representing a decrease of $36 million compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in cash collections from billings of $113 million mainly attributable to lower single installment collections, partially offset by a decrease in vendor disbursements and payroll of $81 million compared with the year-ago period.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $37 million compared with $18 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions and purchased software of $19 million compared with the year-ago period.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $199 million compared with $166 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in common stock repurchases of $80 million, offset by an increase in net debt borrowings from our notional pooling arrangement of $42 million and an increase in exercises of common stock options of $13 million compared with the year-ago period.

Debt Obligations



Term Loan

In April 2018, we amended our term loan agreement with Bank of America, N.A. to extend the maturity date from April 2022 to April 2023.

Other Indebtedness

We had $114 million of unsecured and uncommitted multi-currency lines of credit at June 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018 available to meet short-term working capital needs for our subsidiaries. We use guarantees and letters of credit issued by financial institutions to guarantee performance on certain contracts and other items. At June 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, $56 million and $60 million, respectively, of these lines of credit were pledged in support of bank guarantees and other local credit lines. At June 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, none of these arrangements were drawn down by third parties.




For additional information concerning our debt obligations, refer to our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2018 Form 10-K.

Effect of Exchange Rate Changes

There was a $104 million unfavorable foreign currency translation effect on our cash balances for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 predominantly due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro (5%), the Brazilian real (15%), the Israeli shekel (4%) and the British pound sterling (6%).

There was an $88 million favorable foreign currency translation effect on our cash balances for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 predominantly due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro (7%), the British pound sterling (4%), and the Israeli shekel (4%), partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real (6%).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BUSINESS PRACTICES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about amounts and timing of revenue and expenses, the carrying values of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and the estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change. Information with respect to our critical accounting policies that we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management is contained in our 2018 Form 10-K under Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. At June 30, 2018, there was no material change to our critical accounting policies or the methodologies or assumptions we apply under them since March 31, 2018 other than the impact of adopting Topic 606. Refer to Note 2, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” and Note 3, “Impact of Adopting Topic 606,” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the changes in our policies for revenue recognition and commissions, and the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting Topic 606.

New Accounting Pronouncements

For information regarding new accounting pronouncements, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, refer to Note 1, “Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” of our 2018 Form 10-K. Our exposures to market risk have not changed materially subsequent to March 31, 2018.

Item 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Except as disclosed in the following paragraph, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the period covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

The Company adopted the new revenue recognition guidance under Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The adoption required the Company to establish new accounting policies and implement new accounting processes, including internal controls necessary to have reasonable assurance that the new accounting policy and process objectives are met. These processes and the related internal controls are newly designed and implemented this quarter and were not subject to the Company’s most recent annual evaluation and assessment of internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, the preparation of the financial statements and related notes included in this quarterly report are the first period these controls have operated. Significant changes arising from the adoption of Topic 606 include a new revenue recognition software system to measure periodic revenue, interfaces between the new IT system and the Company’s legacy IT systems, processes to estimate stand-alone selling price for performance obligations, additional or modified controls to identify performance obligations in its contracts, validate data accuracy in its IT systems, and identify and separately account for customer contract modifications. As a result of the foregoing, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, the changes in the Company’s internal controls and processes to meet the requirements of Topic 606 had a material effect on its internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Refer to Note 8, “Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding certain legal proceedings, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

Current and potential stockholders should consider carefully the risk factors described in more detail in our 2018 Form 10-K. There were no material changes to such risk factors, except to include the risk factors described below. Any of these factors, or others, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and stock price.

The announcement and pendency of our agreement to be acquired by Broadcom may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.



•Disruption to our business, including increased costs and diversion of management time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us;

•The restrictions imposed on our business and operations pursuant to certain covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement, which may prevent us from pursuing certain opportunities, responding to competitive pressures and industry developments, or taking certain actions without Broadcom’s approval;

•Adverse effects on our ability to attract, recruit, retain and motivate current and prospective employees who may be uncertain about their future roles following completion of the proposed transaction, and the possibility that our employees could lose productivity as a result of uncertainty regarding their employment following the proposed transaction;

•The pendency and outcome of the legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against us, our directors, executive officers and others relating to the proposed transaction; and

•The diversion of our employees’ attention due to activities related to the proposed transaction.

The failure to complete our pending acquisition by Broadcom may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price.


•Any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the proposed transaction, including adverse changes in our relationships with customers, suppliers, channel partners, other business partners and employees, may continue or intensify in the event the acquisition is not consummated or is significantly delayed;

•We would have incurred significant costs, including professional services fees and other transaction costs, in connection with the proposed transaction that we would be unable to recover;

•We may have to pay Broadcom a termination fee of $566 million under certain circumstances that give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement;

•We may be subject to negative publicity or be negatively perceived by the investment or business communities;

•We may be subject to legal proceedings related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

•We may not be able to take advantage of alternative business opportunities or effectively respond to competitive pressures; and

•We may experience a departure of employees.

The Merger Agreement with Broadcom limits our ability to pursue alternative transactions, which could deter a third party from proposing an alternative transaction.

The Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue an alternative acquisition transaction. These or other provisions may discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing an acquisition or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.
