 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  

  1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Pronouncements   

  Basis of Presentation   

 The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity" or the "Company," which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") and the instructions to Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In management's opinion, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of interim results. The results of operations reported for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire fiscal year or any subsequent interim period.  

 The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017.  

 Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 are to our fiscal years ending September 28, 2018 and ended September 29, 2017, respectively.   

  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement   

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09 which codified Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This guidance supersedes ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and introduces a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model. ASC 606 also enhances disclosures related to revenue recognition. ASC 606, as amended, is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2019. Significantly all our revenues are generated from the sale of products and construction related projects. Our review of these existing contracts, which is substantially complete, affirms that product revenue will continue to be recognized at a point in time in a manner consistent with current practice. In addition, construction related projects, which are accounted for primarily using the percentage-of-completion method, will continue to qualify for revenue recognition over time. In the quarter ended June 29, 2018, we continued the process of updating policies, internal controls, financial statement disclosures, and systems to incorporate the impact of the new standard in our financial reporting processes. We intend to adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective approach and have begun quantifying the impact of the cumulative effect of applying this new standard on existing, uncompleted contracts at the adoption date, which will result in an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated earnings as of September 29, 2018. We do not expect that the cumulative impact of adoption will be material to our results of operations or financial position.   

  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement   

 In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, an update to ASC 220, Income StatementReporting Comprehensive Income, to allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"). See Note 10 for additional information regarding the Act. We elected to early adopt this update in the quarter ended March 30, 2018 and reclassify the stranded tax effects resulting from the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. This change in accounting principle resulted in a  


Table of Contents 

 TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.  

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued)  

  1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Pronouncements (Continued)  

reclassification of $38 million, primarily associated with our pension plans, during the period of adoption. The reclassification increased both accumulated other comprehensive loss and accumulated earnings with no impact to total shareholders' equity.  

 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, an update to ASC 715, CompensationRetirement Benefits, which changes the income statement presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs. The ASU requires that service costs be presented with other employee compensation costs within operating income and that other cost components be presented outside of operating income. We elected to early adopt this update in the quarter ended December 29, 2017. The update was applied retrospectively and did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

  2. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net (Continued)  




 During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions segment. In connection with this program, during the nine months ended June 29, 2018, we recorded restructuring charges of $111 million. We expect to complete significantly all restructuring actions commenced during the nine months ended June 29, 2018 by the end of fiscal 2020 and to incur total charges of approximately $130 million. Remaining charges primarily relate to employee severance.   


 During fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting all segments. In connection with this program, during the nine months ended June 29, 2018 and June 30, 2017, we recorded net restructuring charges of $4 million and $119 million, respectively. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2017 by the end of fiscal 2019 and anticipate that any additional charges will be insignificant.   


 Prior to fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment. During

  2. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net (Continued)  

each of the nine months ended June 29, 2018 and June 30, 2017, we recorded net restructuring charges of $5 million related to pre-fiscal 2017 actions. We expect to incur additional charges of approximately $15 million related to pre-fiscal 2017 actions with the remaining charges related to employee severance primarily in the Communications Solutions segment.

  5. Intangible Assets, Net  



 Intangible asset amortization expense was $45 million and $43 million for the quarters ended June 29, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively, and $135 million and $126 million for the nine months ended June 29, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively.  




 During the nine months ended June 29, 2018, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our 100%-owned subsidiary, repaid, at maturity, $708 million of 6.55% senior notes due October 2017.  

 We reclassified $325 million of 2.375% senior notes due December 2018 from long-term debt to short-term debt on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet during the nine months ended June 29, 2018.  

 During the nine months ended June 29, 2018, TEGSA entered into an uncommitted revolving credit facility under which it borrowed €100 million at a 0% interest rate with repayment due at maturity in December 2018.  

 As of June 29, 2018, TEGSA had $271 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.33%. TEGSA had no commercial paper outstanding at September 29, 2017.  

 The fair value of our debt, based on indicative valuations, was approximately $4,188 million and $4,622 million at June 29, 2018 and September 29, 2017, respectively.

  7. Commitments and Contingencies   

  Legal Proceedings   

 In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.   

  Environmental Matters   

 We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. As of June 29, 2018, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $15 million to $43 million, and we accrued $18 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.   

  Guarantees   


 At June 29, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $283 million.  

 We generally record estimated product warranty costs when contract revenues are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method for construction related contracts; other warranty reserves are not significant. The estimation is based primarily on historical experience and actual warranty claims. Amounts accrued for warranty claims were $46 million and $50 million at June 29, 2018 and September 29, 2017, respectively.   

  Tax Sharing Agreement   

 Under a Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International plc ("Tyco International"), and Covidien plc ("Covidien") share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to the collective income tax returns for certain of our, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and  


Table of Contents 

 TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.  

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued)  

  7. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)  

indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. As a result of subsequent transactions, Tyco International and Covidien now operate as part of Johnson Controls International plc and Medtronic plc, respectively. We have substantially settled all U.S. federal income tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for periods covered under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Certain shared U.S. state and non-U.S. income tax matters remain open. We do not expect these matters will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  


 During fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of €1,000 million to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk associated with certain intercompany loans. Under the terms of these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, we make quarterly interest payments in euros at 3.50% per annum and receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 5.33% per annum. Upon the maturities of these contracts in fiscal 2022, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in euros and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties. In connection with the cross-currency swap contracts, we are required to post cash collateral with our counterparties.

  9. Retirement Plans (Continued)  

 The components of net periodic pension benefit cost other than service cost are included in net other income (expense) on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  

 During the nine months ended June 29, 2018, we contributed $36 million to our non-U.S. pension plans.  


 We recorded income tax expense of $81 million and $71 million for the quarters ended June 29, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively. The income tax expense for the quarter ended June 29, 2018 included a $17 million income tax benefit resulting from lapses of statutes of limitations in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. The income tax expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 included a $14 million income tax benefit associated with pre-separation tax matters.  

 We recorded income tax expense of $789 million and $164 million for the nine months ended June 29, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively. The tax expense for the nine months ended June 29, 2018 included $567 million of income tax expense related to the tax impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a $61 million net income tax benefit related to certain legal entity restructurings, and a $34 million income tax benefit resulting from lapses of statutes of limitations in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. See "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" below for additional information. The tax expense for the nine months ended June 30, 2017 included a $52 million income tax benefit associated with the tax impacts of certain intercompany transactions and the corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance for U.S. tax loss carryforwards, a $24 million income tax benefit resulting from lapses of statutes of limitations in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, and a $14 million income tax benefit associated with pre-separation tax matters.  

 We record accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense. As of June 29, 2018 and September 29, 2017, we had $60 million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, recorded primarily in income taxes. During the nine months ended June 29, 2018, we recognized $2 million of income tax expense related to interest and penalties on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.  

 Although it is difficult to predict the timing or results of our worldwide examinations, we estimate that approximately $30 million of unrecognized income tax benefits, excluding the impact relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months.  

 We are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 29, 2018.   

  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act   

 On December 22, 2017, the President of the U.S. signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") into law. The Act includes numerous significant changes to existing tax law, including a permanent reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, further limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation, repeal of the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, and imposition of a territorial tax system with a one-time repatriation tax on

 TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.

  10. Income Taxes (Continued)  

deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. While some of the new provisions of the Act will impact us in fiscal 2019 and beyond, the change in the tax rate was effective January 1, 2018. In the period of enactment, we were required to revalue our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new tax rate. Accordingly, during the quarter ended December 29, 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $567 million primarily in connection with the write-down of our U.S. federal deferred tax asset for net operating loss and interest carryforwards to the lower tax rate. Included in the expense of $567 million was an income tax benefit of $34 million related to the reduction in the existing valuation allowance recorded against certain U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards. The limitations on interest expense deductions contained in the Act are expected to increase prospective taxable income and thereby allow the utilization of more tax credits in future years. As a Swiss corporation, the one-time repatriation tax imposed by the Act will not be significant to us.  

 The Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, and in certain instances, lacks clarity and is subject to interpretation until additional IRS guidance is issued. The ultimate impact of the Act may differ from our estimates due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions we made as well as any forthcoming regulatory guidance. One area requiring guidance is a transition rule regarding limitations on interest expense deductions. The Act does not address the treatment of the carryforward of disallowed interest expense generated under the prior law. Our interpretation is that the carryforward of interest should survive and will be deductible in future periods subject to the new interest limitations. Accordingly, during the quarter ended December 29, 2017, we revalued our beginning deferred tax asset related to our interest carryforwards to $223 million to reflect the lower tax rate. It is possible additional regulatory guidance could be issued contrary to this interpretation at which point we may be required to record a charge to income tax expense to revalue or eliminate the related deferred tax asset. On April 2, 2018, the Treasury Department and the IRS issued Notice 2018-28 stating their intention to issue regulations consistent with our position related to the carryforward of the disallowed interest expense.  

  11. Earnings Per Share  



 There were one million share options that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended June 30, 2017 because the instruments' underlying exercise price were greater than the average market prices of our common shares and inclusion would be antidilutive.  


Table of Contents 

 TE CONNECTIVITY LTD.  

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued)  


  Common Shares   

 In March 2018, our shareholders reapproved and extended through March 14, 2020, our board of directors' authorization to issue additional new shares, subject to certain conditions specified in our articles of association, in aggregate not exceeding 50% of the amount of our authorized shares.   

  Dividends   

 We paid a cash dividend of $0.40 per share to shareholders in each of the quarters ended December 29, 2017 and March 30, 2018.  

 In March 2018, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $1.76 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We paid the first installment of the dividend at a rate of $0.44 per share in the quarter ended June 29, 2018.  

 Upon shareholders' approval of a dividend payment, we record a liability with a corresponding charge to shareholders' equity. At June 29, 2018 and September 29, 2017, the unpaid portion of the dividends recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $459 million and $281 million, respectively.   

  Share Repurchase Program   



 At June 29, 2018, we had $1.4 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.

 As of June 29, 2018, there was $153 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to share-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.  



 As of June 29, 2018, we had 20 million shares available for issuance under our stock and incentive plans, of which the TE Connectivity Ltd. 2007 Stock and Incentive Plan, amended and restated as of March 8, 2017, was the primary plan.

     ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading "Forward-Looking Information" and "Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors."  

 Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in United States ("U.S.") dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").  

 The following discussion includes organic net sales growth which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure" for additional information regarding this measure.  

 Overview 

 TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity" or the "Company," which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") is a global technology and manufacturing leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. For more than 75 years, our connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, have enabled advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home.  


 Our net sales increased 11.8% and 13.8% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of growth in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $131 million and $481 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2017. On an organic basis, our net sales increased 6.2% and 7.0% during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2017.  


Transportation SolutionsOur net sales increased 19.7% and 20.8% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, as a result of sales increases in all end markets.   

Industrial SolutionsOur net sales increased 9.2% and 11.3% during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, due primarily to increased sales in the industrial equipment and the aerospace, defense, oil, and gas end markets.   

Communications SolutionsOur net sales decreased 4.7% and 2.1% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, due to sales declines in the subsea communications end market, partially offset by sales increases in the appliances and the data and devices end markets.  

 Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,527 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.   

  Outlook  

 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect our net sales to be between $3.59 billion and $3.69 billion as compared to $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect our net sales to be between $14.58 billion and $14.68 billion in fiscal 2018 as compared to $13.1 billion in fiscal 2017.  


Table of Contents 


Transportation SolutionsWe expect our net sales growth in the automotive end market to exceed anticipated global automotive production growth as a result of increased content per vehicle and sales contributions from a recent acquisition. In fiscal 2018, we expect global automotive production growth of approximately 2%. We also expect continued growth in the commercial transportation and sensors end markets.  

Industrial SolutionsIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect our net sales to increase in all end markets. In fiscal 2018, we expect our net sales growth to be driven by strength in the industrial equipment, defense, and commercial aerospace markets.   

Communications SolutionsWe expect net sales declines in our subsea communications end market to be partially offset by sales growth in the appliances and the data and devices end markets. We expect our net sales in the subsea communications end market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to be consistent with sales levels in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.   

We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.23 to $1.25 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2018, we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.81 per share. The outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 reflects the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $49 million and $0.02 per share, respectively, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2017. The fiscal 2018 outlook reflects the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and earnings per share of approximately $423 million and $0.19 per share, respectively, as compared to fiscal 2017.  

 The above outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels.  

 We are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. We continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs.

 Results of Operations 

  Net Sales  




Table of Contents 



 Net sales increased $397 million, or 11.8%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales resulted from organic net sales growth of 6.2%, the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 3.9% due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies, and sales contributions from acquisitions of 1.7%. Price erosion adversely affected organic net sales by $55 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.  

 In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, net sales increased $1,332 million, or 13.8%, as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017 as a result of organic net sales growth of 7.0%, the positive impact of foreign currency translation of 4.9% due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies, and sales contributions from acquisitions of 1.9%. Price erosion adversely affected organic net sales by $148 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.  

 See further discussion of net sales below under "Segment Results."  


 Approximately 60% of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.

  Cost of Sales and Gross Margin  



 Gross margin increased $77 million and $320 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2017. The increases were due primarily to higher volume and the positive impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by the negative impact of price erosion. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 32.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from 33.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and decreased to 33.1% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 from 34.3% in the same period of fiscal 2017.

  Operating Expenses  



 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $409 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to $408 million in the same period of fiscal 2017. Increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels were offset by lower incentive compensation costs. In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $38 million from the same period in fiscal 2017. The increase resulted primarily from increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels and incremental expenses attributable to recently acquired businesses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs and a gain on the sale of certain assets. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 10.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from 12.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and decreased to 11.1% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 from 12.2% in the same period of fiscal 2017.  

 Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses. In the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, research, development, and engineering expenses increased $13 million and $54 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods of fiscal 2017 due to costs related to growth initiatives, primarily in the Transportation Solutions segment.  

 Restructuring and Other Charges, Net. We are committed to continuous productivity improvements and consistently evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth.  

 During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions segment. During fiscal 2017, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting all segments.  

 In connection with these initiatives, we incurred net restructuring charges of $120 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, of which $111 million related to the fiscal 2018 restructuring program. Annualized cost savings related to the fiscal 2018 actions commenced during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $90 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2020. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. During fiscal 2018, we expect to incur net restructuring charges of approximately $150 million. We expect total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $130 million in fiscal 2018.  

 See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.

Excluding these items, operating income decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 due primarily to declines in our Subsea Communications business related to production delays.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the payment of $325 million of 2.375% senior notes and €100 million borrowed under the uncommitted revolving credit facility, both of which are due in December 2018. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt, including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions.  

  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

 In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased $78 million to $1,527 million from $1,449 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. The increase resulted primarily from higher pre-tax income levels, partially offset by an increase in employee-compensation related payments.  

 The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017 was $317 million and $256 million, respectively. We do not expect a significant change in our income tax payments as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  

  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  

 Capital expenditures were $686 million and $452 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect fiscal 2018 capital spending levels to be approximately 6% of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities.  

  Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization  

 Total debt at June 29, 2018 and September 29, 2017 was $4,008 million and $4,344 million, respectively. See Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.

 During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our 100%-owned subsidiary, repaid, at maturity, $708 million of 6.55% senior notes due October 2017.  

 During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, TEGSA entered into an uncommitted revolving credit facility under which it borrowed €100 million at a 0% interest rate with repayment due at maturity in December 2018.  

 TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility") with a maturity date of December 2020 and total commitments of $1,500 million. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at June 29, 2018 or September 29, 2017. Borrowings under our commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility and reduce the availability of funds from the Credit Facility.  

 The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of June 29, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future.  

 In addition to the Credit Facility, TEGSA is the borrower under our senior notes and commercial paper. TEGSA's payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.  

 In March 2018, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $1.76 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.44 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.  

 Payments of common share dividends to shareholders were $435 million and $405 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.  

 During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, our board of directors authorized an increase of $1.5 billion in the share repurchase program. We repurchased approximately 6 million of our common shares for $612 million and approximately 5 million of our common shares for $386 million under our share repurchase program during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. At June 29, 2018, we had $1.4 billion of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.  

 Commitments and Contingencies 

  Legal Proceedings  

 In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  

  Guarantees  

 In certain instances, we have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2018 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would  


Table of Contents 

be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  


 At June 29, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $283 million.  

  Tax Sharing Agreement  

 We are a party to a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs our, Tyco International plc's, and Covidien plc's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations with respect to taxes for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement.  

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

 The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses.  

 Our accounting policies for revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, and pension liabilities are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management. For additional information regarding these policies and the underlying accounting assumptions and estimates used in these policies, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2017. There were no significant changes to this information during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.  

 Accounting Pronouncements 

 See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.  

 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

  Organic Net Sales Growth  

 We present organic net sales growth as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth represents net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.  


Table of Contents 

 Organic net sales growth provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance. Also, management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The tables presented in "Results of Operations" and "Segment Results" provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated in accordance with GAAP.  

 Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth in combination with net sales growth in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.
