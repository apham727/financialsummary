FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, INC. REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND APPOINTS INVESTMENT BANKER FOR CORPORATE OPTIONS 


Second Quarter 2018 Summary 

 ●Q2 2018 consolidated sales were $15.0 million, compared to $22.1 million in Q2 2017, and were lower primarily due to a decrease in sales in the Suttle and JDL segments, offset partially by higher sales at Net2Edge. 

 ●Q2 2018 consolidated net loss was $2.6 million compared to a net loss of $4.1 million in Q2 2017, which included $1.1 million of restructuring costs associated with closing Suttle’s Costa Rica facility and $1.6 million of write off of goodwill and intangible assets. The 2018 Q2 losses were primarily driven by operating losses in Suttle, JDL Technologies and Net2Edge. 

 ●Transition Networks continued to report positive operating income and lower operating expenses. Q2 2018 operating income was $19,000 compared to $361,000 in Q2 2017. 

 ●Suttle’s Q2 operating loss of $1.7 million narrowed from the $2.7 million operating loss in Q2 2017 as product margins improved due to pricing changes and product mix, offset by higher manufacturing variances due to low production and due to Suttle’s Q2 2017’s restructuring costs of $1.1 million related to closing its Costa Rica facility. 

 ●JDL Technologies had an operating loss of $406,000 in Q2 2018 compared to $1.1 million operating loss last year driven by the 2017 goodwill write off of $1.5M and lower education revenue, partially offset by lower operating expenses. 

 ●Net2Edge had an operating loss of $640,000 in Q2 2018 compared to $715,000 operating loss last year driven by higher sales, partially offset by lower margins and higher operating expenses. 

 ●The Company’s Q2 2018 consolidated net loss was $2.6 million, or $(0.29) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $4.1 million, or $(0.46) per diluted share, in Q2 2017. Due to losses sustained in 2015 through 2017, we have applied a tax valuation allowance to the 2018 tax provision resulting in limited tax benefit being recorded. 


“JDL’s losses continued, driven by the ongoing approval delays we discussed last quarter within its primary education customer’s federal funding process. We have completed work on some wireless projects that have been approved and with the anticipated release of the pending approvals, we do expect JDL to achieve its quarterly targeted profit result by the end of the year. Net2Edge had significant revenue growth and we believe new orders will continue as customers complete their proof-of-concept stage for Net2Edge’s new products. With products now in production, we are now optimizing our procurement process. 

“The Suttle situation continues to be severely impacted by the Tier 1 Telecom companies’ move away from our range of legacy products. Additional right sizing of operations took place in Q2. Options to resolve the underutilized capacity in manufacturing are being considered. The “Suttle Home, Securely Wired” offer will be trialed in third quarter 2018, as we are targeting the rapidly emerging home automation and residential Internet of Things (“IOT”) substantial growth opportunity. 

Mr. Lacey concluded “In June the ‘Special Committee’ of the Board of Directors met several times to discuss future corporate options and Northland Capital Markets was appointed as the Committee’s strategic advisor to assist the company. Together they have been evaluating options and proposals are being actively considered. While we understand the frustration our shareholders feel in lack of progress in CSI returning to profitability, we remain optimistic that our ongoing initiatives can result in a return to profitability. 

“In addition, this spring we were approached by a buyer to acquire our headquarters site in Minnetonka, Minnesota. Today we signed a purchase agreement for the sale of the building for $10 million and while there are several contingencies because of the due diligence to be completed by the buyer over the next 180 days, we believe this move will benefit all stakeholders. If the sale proceeds, we expect the close would occur in the second or third quarter of 2019. We believe a move to a new site would provide a better working environment for our ongoing businesses and an employee committee will be formed to provide input. Since we have significant excess space in our current building, we view a sale as another means to potentially reduce operating expenses.”

Q2 2018 Segment Financial Overview  

Transition Networks 


Transition Networks’ Q2 2018 sales decreased $1,666,000, or 18%, compared to Q2 2017, primarily due to a decrease in federal projects and lower sales to a significant service provider. Sales in North America decreased $1,635,000, or 20%, while international sales decreased $31,000, or 2%. Operating expenses in Q2 2018 decreased $445,000 or 11% compared to the prior year. Transition Networks’ operating income was $19,000 in Q2 2018, compared to $361,000 in Q2 2017, as margin percentages remained consistent on lower sales, while expenses were reduced. 

Suttle 


Suttle’s sales decreased 32% to $5.9 million in Q2 2018 from $8.6 million in Q2 2017 due to lower sales of its legacy products. Sales to the major communication service providers decreased 40% to $4.5 million in Q2 2018 from $7.5 million in Q2 2017. Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 7.8% from 9.5% in the same period of 2017 primarily due to unabsorbed manufacturing costs due to low production volume and severance costs, offset partially by higher product margins driven by a new pricing strategy for distributors. Operating expenses in Q2 2018 decreased $1.3 million compared to prior year when Suttle expensed $1.1 million in Q2 2017 for restructuring expense related to the closing of its Costa Rica production facility. 

JDL Technologies 


JDL Technologies’ sales decreased 77% to $913,000 in Q2 2018 from $4.0 million in Q2 2017. Revenue from the education sector declined with Q2 2018 revenue of $280,000 compared to $3.2 million in Q2 2017. The revenue decline is due to delays in the approval of federal funding for the 2017-2018 funding cycle. Operating expenses decreased 14% in 2018 to $478,000, compared to $557,000 in 2017 due to expense reduction measures taken in light of the expected revenue delay in the education sector. Q2 2018 ended with an operating loss of $406,000 compared to operating loss of $1.1 million Q2 2017, which included the $1.5M write off of goodwill. 



Net2Edge’s sales increased 278% to $681,000 in Q2 2018 from $180,000 in Q2 2017 primarily due to revenue from an established CSI account with Net2Edge’s higher-featured products. Operating expenses increased 17% in 2018 to $820,000 compared to $701,000 in 2017 due to increased spending on engineering and research and development on new products. 

Financial Condition 

CSI’s balance sheet at June 30, 2018 included cash, cash equivalents and investments of $14.2 million and working capital of $32.4 million, compared to $18.0 million cash, cash equivalents and investments and $36.5 million working capital at December 31, 2017.
