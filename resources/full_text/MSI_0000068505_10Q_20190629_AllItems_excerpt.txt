Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements




Basis of Presentation

The condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 29, 2019 and for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 include, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications) necessary to present fairly the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations, Statements of Comprehensive Income, Statements of Stockholders' Equity, and Statements of Cash Flows of Motorola Solutions, Inc. (“Motorola Solutions” or the “Company”) for all periods presented.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20) - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans,” which modifies the disclosure requirements for the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans. The ASU is effective for the Company on January 1, 2021 with early adoption permitted. The ASU requires a retrospective adoption method. The Company does not believe the ASU will have a material impact on its financial statement disclosures.



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. This was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-01, “Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842,” ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases,” and ASU No. 2018-11, “Targeted Improvements” (collectively "ASC 842"). ASC 842 establishes a right-of-use model ("ROU") that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with an initial term longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and presentation of expense recognition in the income statement.

The Company adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at January 1, 2019, the date of the initial application. Consequently, financial information will not be updated and disclosures required under ASC 842 will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019.

ASC 842 provides for a number of optional practical expedients in transition. The Company elected the practical expedients, which permit the Company to not reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs under ASC 842. The Company did not elect the "use-of hindsight" practical expedient to determine the lease term or in assessing the likelihood that a lease purchase option will be exercised, allowing it to carry forward the lease term as determined prior to adoption of ASC 842. Finally, the Company also elected the practical expedient related to land easements, which enabled it to continue its accounting treatment for land easements on existing agreements as of January 1, 2019.

ASC 842 also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. A short-term lease is one with a term of 12 months or less, including any optional periods that are reasonably certain of exercise. For those leases that qualify, the exemption allows the Company to not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, including not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases at transition. Short-term lease costs are recognized as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term consistent with the Company’s prior accounting. The Company also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all current lease categories. 

As of January 1, 2019, the Company recognized operating lease liabilities of $648 million based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments determined under prior lease accounting standards and corresponding ROU assets of $588 million. The $60 million difference between operating lease liabilities and ROU assets recognized is due to deferred rent and exit cost accruals recorded under prior lease accounting standards. ASC 842 requires such balances to be reclassified against ROU assets at transition.



2. Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Disaggregation of Revenue





Remaining Performance Obligations 

Remaining performance obligations represent the revenue that is expected to be recognized in future periods related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the end of a period. The transaction price associated with remaining performance obligations which are not yet satisfied as of June 29, 2019 is $7.3 billion. A total of $3.1 billion is from Products and Systems Integration performance obligations that are not yet satisfied, of which $1.7 billion is expected to be recognized in the next 12 months. The remaining amounts will generally be satisfied over time as systems are implemented. A total of $4.2 billion is from Services and Software performance obligations that are not yet satisfied as of June 29, 2019. The determination of Services and Software performance obligations that are not satisfied takes into account a contract term that may be limited by the customer’s ability to terminate for convenience. Where termination for convenience exists in the Company's service contracts, its disclosure of the remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied assumes the contract term is limited until renewal. The Company expects to recognize $1.2 billion from unsatisfied Services and Software performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the remaining performance obligations to be recognized over time as services are performed and software is implemented. 

Contract Balances


Revenue recognized during the three months ended June 29, 2019 which was previously included in Contract liabilities as of March 30, 2019 is $340 million, compared to $365 million of revenue recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2018 which was previously included in Contract liabilities as of April 1, 2018. Revenue recognized during the six months ended June 29, 2019 which was previously included in Contract liabilities as of December 31, 2018 is $600 million, compared to $541 million of revenue recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2018 which was previously included in Contract liabilities as of January 1, 2018. Adjustments to revenue for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018 driven by changes in the estimates of progress on system contracts was immaterial. 

There were no material impairment losses recognized on contract assets during the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018.


Contract Cost Balances


Amortization of contract cost assets was $11 million for the three months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively, and $22 million and $23 million for the six months ended June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively.


The Company leases certain office, factory and warehouse space, land, and other equipment, principally under non-cancelable operating leases. 

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract. The Company's key decisions in determining whether a contract is or contains a lease include establishing whether the supplier has the ability to use other assets to fulfill its service or whether the terms of the agreement enable the Company to control the use of a dedicated asset during the contract term. In the majority of the Company's contracts where it must identify whether a lease is present, it is readily determinable that the Company controls the use of the assets and obtains substantially all of the economic benefit during the term of the contract. In those contracts where identification is not readily determinable, the Company has determined that the supplier has either the ability to use another asset to provide the service or the terms of the contract give the supplier the rights to operate the asset at its discretion during the term of the contract. 

ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The Company's lease payments are typically fixed or contain fixed escalators. The Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of its current lease categories and therefore, all consideration is included in the lease liabilities. For the Company's leases consisting of both land and other equipment (i.e. "communication network sites"), future payments are subject to variability due to changes in indices or rates. The Company values its ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the index or rate in effect at lease commencement. Future changes in the indices or rates are accounted for as variable lease costs. Other variable lease costs also include items that are not fixed at lease commencement including property taxes, insurance, and operating charges that vary based on usage. ROU assets also include lease payments made in advance and are net of lease incentives.

As the majority of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The Company's incremental borrowing rates are based on the term of the lease, the economic environment of the lease, and the effect of collateralization. 

The Company's lease terms range from one to twenty-one years and may include options to extend the lease by one to ten years or terminate the lease after the initial non-cancelable term. The Company does not include options in the determination of the lease term for the majority of leases as sufficient economic factors do not exist that would compel it to continue to use the underlying asset beyond the initial non-cancelable term. However, for the Company's communication network site leases that are necessary to provide services to customers under managed service arrangements, the Company includes options in the lease term to the extent of the customer contracts to which those leases relate. 












Rental expense, net of sublease income, for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $108 million.

Earnings Per Common Share



In the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019, the assumed exercise of 0.5 million options, including 0.3 million subject to market-based contingent option agreements, were excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive.

For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the assumed exercise of 1.4 million options, including 1.2 million subject to market-based contingent option agreements, were excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the assumed exercise of 2.9 million options, including 2.4 million subject to market-based contingent stock agreements, were excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. 

As of June 29, 2019, the Company had $800 million of 2.0% Senior Convertible Notes outstanding which mature in September 2020 (the "Senior Convertible Notes"), and are fully convertible. In the event of a conversion, the Company intends to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash and accordingly, only the number of shares that would be issuable (under the treasury stock method of accounting for share dilution) are included in our computation of diluted earnings per share. The conversion price is adjusted for dividends declared through the date of settlement. Diluted earnings per share has been calculated based upon the amount by which the average stock price exceeds the conversion price.

Investments



Strategic investments include investments in non-public technology-driven startup companies. Strategic investments do not have a readily determinable fair value and are recorded at cost, less any impairment, and adjusted for changes resulting from observable, orderly transactions for identical or similar securities. The Company did not recognize any significant adjustments to the recorded cost basis during the six months ended June 29, 2019, with the exception of one company becoming publicly-traded during the second quarter, which required the investment to be reclassified to common stock.

The Company’s common stock portfolio reflects investments in publicly-traded companies within the communications services sector and is valued utilizing active market prices for similar instruments. During the three and six months ended 


June 29, 2019, the Company recognized $15 million and $14 million, respectively, in Other income (expense) related to an increase in the fair value of the investments.

During the three months ended June 29, 2019, Gains on the sale of investments and businesses, net were $3 million, related to the sale of a business, compared to losses of $1 million, related to the sale of various strategic investments during the three months ended June 30, 2018.

5. Debt and Credit Facilities


As of June 29, 2019, the Company had a $2.2 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in April 2022 (the "2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement"). The 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a $500 million letter of credit sub-limit with $450 million of fronting commitments. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), at the Company's option. An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the Company's credit rating changes. The Company must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants as of June 29, 2019. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company borrowed $400 million to facilitate the Avigilon acquisition which was re-paid by December 31, 2018. There were no borrowings outstanding or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2018 and June 29, 2019.

In February of 2018, the Company issued $500 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2028. The Company recognized net proceeds of $497 million after debt issuance costs and debt discounts. These proceeds were then used to make a $500 million contribution to the Company's U.S. pension plan. During the second half of 2018, the Company issued an additional $200 million on the outstanding notes. The Company recognized net proceeds of $196 million after debt issuance costs and debt discounts.

In conjunction with the Avigilon acquisition in the first quarter of 2018, the Company entered into a term loan for $400 million with a maturity date of March 26, 2021 (the “Term Loan”). Interest on the Term Loan is variable, indexed to LIBOR, and paid monthly. The weighted average borrowing rate for amounts outstanding during the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 were 3.72% and 3.74%, respectively. No additional borrowings are permitted and amounts borrowed and repaid or prepaid may not be re-borrowed.

In May of 2019, the Company issued $650 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2029. The Company recognized net proceeds of $645 million after debt issuance costs and debt discounts. These proceeds were then used to fund a tender offer which resulted in the repurchase of $614 million in principal amount of its outstanding long-term debt for a purchase price of $654 million, excluding approximately $3 million of accrued interest, all of which occurred during the three months ended June 29, 2019. After accelerating the amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts, the Company recognized a loss of approximately $43 million related to this debt tender in Other within Other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

As of June 29, 2019, the Company had $800 million of 2.0% Senior Convertible Notes outstanding with Silver Lake Partners which mature in September 2020 and are fully convertible. The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 14.8968, as may be adjusted for dividends declared, per $1,000 principal amount (which is currently equal to a conversion price of $67.13 per share). The exercise price adjusts automatically for dividends. The value by which the Senior Convertible Notes exceeded their principal amount if converted as of June 29, 2019 was $1.1 billion. In the event of a conversion, the Company intends to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash. 



Foreign Currency Risk

As of June 29, 2019, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $1.0 billion, compared to $819 million outstanding at December 31, 2018. The Company does not believe these financial instruments should subject it to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should generally offset gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions.



Counterparty Risk

The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to counterparty credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments when the derivative is in an asset position. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk. As of June 29, 2019, all of the counterparties have investment grade credit ratings. As of June 29, 2019, the Company had $12 million of exposure to aggregate credit risk with all counterparties.







Net Investment Hedges

The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts with contract terms of 12 to 15 months to hedge against the effect of the British pound and the Euro exchange rate fluctuations against the U.S. dollar on a portion of its net investment in certain European operations. The Company recognizes changes in the fair value of the net investment hedges as a component of foreign currency translation adjustments within other comprehensive income to offset a portion of the change in translated value of the net investment being hedged, until the investment is sold or liquidated. In accordance with ASU 2017-02, the Company has elected to exclude the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate of the forward contract from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. The effect of the excluded components will be amortized on a straight line basis and recognized through interest expense. As of June 29, 2019, the Company had €95 million of net investment hedges in certain Euro functional subsidiaries and £100 million of net investment hedges in certain British pound functional subsidiaries. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2019, the Company amortized $2 million and $3 million, respectively, of income from the excluded components through interest expense.


At the end of each interim reporting period, the Company makes an estimate of its annual effective income tax rate. Tax expense in interim periods is calculated at the estimated annual effective tax rate plus or minus the tax effects of items of income and expense that are discrete to the period. The estimate used in providing for income taxes on a year-to-date basis may change in subsequent interim periods.



During the three and six months ended June 29, 2019, the Company recorded $67 million and $100 million of net tax expense, resulting in effective tax rates of 24% and 22%, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded $46 million and $69 million of net tax expense, resulting in effective tax rates of 20% and 19%, respectively. The three and six months ended June 29, 2019 effective tax rates include state tax expense, offset by excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 of 24% and 22%, respectively, is higher than the effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 of 20% and 19%, respectively, primarily due to a favorable settlement of a state audit in 2018. 


8. Retirement and Other Employee Benefits

Pension and Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plans 




9. Share-Based Compensation Plans



During the six months ended June 29, 2019, the Company granted 0.5 million restricted stock units ("RSUs") and 0.1 million market stock units ("MSUs") with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $64 million and $7 million, respectively, and 


 0.2 million stock options and 0.2 million performance options ("POs") with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $6 million and $7 million, respectively. The share-based compensation expense will generally be recognized over the vesting period of three years.

During the six months ended June 29, 2019, the Company granted an additional 0.4 million of restricted stock in connection with the acquisition of VaaS, with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $38 million related to compensation withheld from the purchase price that will be expensed over an average service period of one year. 


The Company calculates the value of each PSU using the Monte Carlo simulation, estimated on the date of grant. Each PSU was granted with a fair value of $203.61. The following assumptions were used for the calculations.


Subsequent to the six months ended June 29, 2019, the Company granted restricted stock and restricted stock units in connection with the acquisition of WatchGuard for an aggregate grant date fair value of $16 million that will be expensed over an average service period of two years.

10. Fair Value Measurements


Level 1 — Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

Level 2 — Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations, in which all significant inputs are observable, in active markets.

Level 3 — Valuations derived from valuation techniques, in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable. 





The Company had no Level 3 holdings as of June 29, 2019 or December 31, 2018.

At June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had $419 million and $734 million, respectively, of investments in money market prime and government funds (Level 1) classified as Cash and cash equivalents in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The money market funds had quoted market prices that are equivalent to par.

Using quoted market prices and market interest rates, the Company determined that the fair value of long-term debt at June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $5.6 billion and $5.4 billion (Level 2), respectively. 

All other financial instruments are carried at cost, which is not materially different from the instruments’ fair values.

11. Long-term Financing and Sales of Receivables

Long-term Financing



The current portion of long-term receivables is included in Accounts receivable, net and the non-current portion of long-term receivables is included in Other assets in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had outstanding commitments to provide long-term financing to third parties totaling $53 million at June 29, 2019, compared to $62 million at December 31, 2018. 

Sales of Receivables



At June 29, 2019, the Company had retained servicing obligations for $971 million of long-term receivables, compared to $970 million at December 31, 2018. Servicing obligations are limited to collection activities related to the sales of accounts receivables and long-term receivables. 


12. Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Matters

The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits, claims, and actions, which arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. However, an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations in the periods in which the matters are ultimately resolved, or in the periods in which more information is obtained that changes management's opinion of the ultimate disposition.

Other Indemnifications

The Company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it is obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. In indemnification cases, payment by the Company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow the Company to challenge the other party's claims. In some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the Company.

Some of these obligations arise as a result of divestitures of the Company's assets or businesses and require the Company to indemnify the other party against losses arising from breaches of representations and warranties and covenants and, in some cases, the settlement of pending obligations. The Company's obligations under divestiture agreements for indemnification based on breaches of representations and warranties are generally limited in terms of duration and to amounts not in excess of a percentage of the contract value. The Company had no accruals for any such obligations at June 29, 2019.

In addition, the Company may provide indemnifications for losses that result from the breach of general warranties contained in certain commercial and intellectual property agreements. Historically, the Company has not made significant payments under these agreements.






14. Reorganization of Business


During the three months ended June 29, 2019, the Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of $12 million including $8 million of charges in Other charges and $4 million of charges in Costs of sales in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Included in the $12 million were charges of $18 million related to employee separation, partially offset by $6 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.

During the six months ended June 29, 2019, the Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of $20 million including $12 million of charges in Other charges and $8 million of charges in Costs of sales in the Company's Condensed 


Consolidated Statements of Operations. Included in the $20 million were charges of $30 million related to employee separation, partially offset by $10 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.





Employee Separation Costs

At January 1, 2019, the Company had an accrual of $84 million for employee separation costs. The 2019 additional charges of $30 million represent severance costs for approximately 300 employees. The adjustment of $10 million reflects reversals for accruals no longer needed. The $28 million used reflects cash payments to severed employees. The remaining accrual of $76 million, which is included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 29, 2019, is expected to be paid, primarily within one year, to approximately 900 employees, who have either been severed or have been notified of their severance and have begun or will begin receiving payments.

("WatchGuard"), a provider of in-car and body-worn video solutions for $271 million, inclusive of share-based compensation withheld at a fair value of $16 million that will be expensed over an average service period of two years. The acquisition was settled with $250 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition expands the Company's video security solutions platform. The business will be part of both the Products and Systems Integration and Services and Software segments. The purchase accounting for this acquisition will commence in the third quarter of 2019.


On March 11, 2019, the Company announced that it acquired Avtec, Inc. ("Avtec"), a provider of dispatch communication equipment for U.S. public safety and commercial customers for a purchase price of $136 million in cash, net of cash acquired. This acquisition expands the Company's commercial portfolio with new capabilities, allowing it to offer an enhanced platform for customers to communicate, coordinate resources, and secure their facilities. The business will be part of both the Products and Systems Integration and Services and Software segments. The Company recognized $68 million of goodwill, $64 million of identifiable intangible assets, and $4 million of net assets. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. The identifiable intangible assets were classified as $43 million of completed technology and $21 million of customer relationship intangibles and will be amortized over a period of 15 years. The purchase accounting is not yet complete and as such the final allocation between goodwill and net assets may be subject to change based on the finalization of working capital considerations.

On January 7, 2019, the Company announced that it acquired VaaS International Holdings ("VaaS"), a company that is a global provider of data and image analytics for vehicle location for $445 million, inclusive of share-based compensation withheld at a fair value of $38 million that will be expensed over an average service period of one year. The acquisition was settled with $231 million of cash, net of cash acquired, and 1.4 million of shares issued at a fair value of $160 million for a purchase price of $391 million to be utilized in the purchase price allocation. The business will be part of both the Products and Systems Integration and Services and Software segments. The Company recognized $261 million of goodwill, $141 million of identifiable intangible assets, and $11 million of net liabilities. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The identifiable intangible assets were classified as $99 million of completed technology that will be amortized over a period of ten years and $42 million of customer relationship intangibles that will be amortized over a period of 15 years. The purchase accounting is not yet complete and as such the final allocation between deferred income tax accounts, goodwill, and net liabilities may be subject to change based on the settlement of working capital considerations.

 On March 28, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Avigilon Corporation, a provider of advanced security and video solutions including video analytics, network video management hardware and software, video cameras and access control solutions. The purchase price of $974 million, consisted of cash payments of $980 million for outstanding common stock, restricted stock units and employee held stock options, net of cash acquired of $107 million, debt assumed of $75 million and transaction costs of $26 million. Prior to the end of the first quarter of 2018, $35 million of the assumed debt was repaid with the remaining $40 million repaid during the second quarter of 2018. The Company recognized $498 million of identifiable intangible assets, $434 million of goodwill, and$42 million of net assets. Acquired intangible assets consist of $110 million of customer relationships, $380 million of developed technology and $8 million of trade names and will have useful lives of two to twenty years. The fair values of all intangible assets were estimated using the income approach. Customer relationships and developed technology were valued under the excess earnings method which assumes that the value of an intangible asset is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable specifically to the intangible asset. Trade names were valued under the relief from royalty method, which assumes value to the extent that the acquired company is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

On March 7, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Plant Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Airbus DS Communications for a purchase price of $237 million in cash, net cash acquired. This acquisition expanded the Company's software portfolio in the command center with additional solutions for Next Generation 9-1-1. The Company recognized $160 million of goodwill, $80 million of identifiable intangible assets, and $3 million of net liabilities. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The identifiable intangible assets were classified as $41 million of customer-related intangibles, $27 million of completed technology and $12 million of trade names. The identifiable intangible assets will be amortized over a period of ten to twenty years.

The pro forma effects of these acquisitions are not significant.

Any devices from these acquisitions are included within the Products and Systems Integration segment and services and software offerings from these acquisitions are included in the Services and Software segment.

The decrease in net interest expense in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 was a result of less average debt outstanding as of and for the period ending June 29, 2019 as compared to the period ending June 30, 2018.

Sales of Receivables



The proceeds of our receivable sales are included in "Operating activities" within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Debt

We had outstanding long-term debt of $5.3 billion, including the current portions of $28 million and $31 million at June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 

In February of 2018, we issued $500 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2028. After debt issuance costs and debt discounts, we recognized net proceeds of $497 million. These proceeds were then used to make a $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan in the first quarter of 2018. During the second half of 2018, we issued an additional $200 million on the outstanding notes. We recognized net proceeds of $196 million after debt issuance costs and debt discounts.

To complete the acquisition of Avigilon during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we entered into a term loan for $400 million with a maturity date of March 26, 2021 (the "Term Loan"). Interest on the Term Loan is variable, indexed to London Inter-bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), and paid monthly. The weighted average borrowing rate for amounts outstanding during the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 was 3.72% and 3.74%, respectively. No additional borrowings are permitted and amounts borrowed and repaid or prepaid may not be re-borrowed. 

In May of 2019, we issued $650 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2029. We recognized net proceeds of $645 million after debt issuance costs and debt discounts. These proceeds were then used to fund a tender offer which resulted in the repurchase of $614 million in principal amount of our outstanding long-term debt for a purchase price of $654 million, excluding approximately $3 million of accrued interest, all of which occurred during the three months ended June 29, 2019. After accelerating the amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts, we recognized a loss of approximately $43 million related to this debt tender in Other within Other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

As of June 29, 2019, we had $800 million of 2.0% Senior Convertible Notes outstanding with Silver Lake Partners which mature in September 2020 and are fully convertible. The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 14.8968, as may be adjusted for dividends declared, per $1,000 principal amount (which is currently equal to a published conversion price of $67.13 per share). The exercise price adjusts automatically for dividends. In the event of a conversion, the notes may be settled in either cash or stock, at our discretion. We intend to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash.

We continue to believe that we hold sufficient liquidity to cover the day-to-day operations of our business as well as any future volatility or uncertainty that may arise in the capital markets.

Credit Facilities

As of June 29, 2019, we had a $2.2 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in April 2022 (the "2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement"). The 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a $500 million letter of credit sub-limit with $450 million of fronting commitments. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above LIBOR, at our option. An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if our credit rating changes. We must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of June 29, 2019. During the first quarter of 2018, we borrowed $400 million to facilitate the Avigilon acquisition. There were no borrowings outstanding or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility as of June 29, 2019.

Share Repurchase Program

During the three and six months ended June 29, 2019, we paid an aggregate of $25 million and $170 million, including transaction costs, to repurchase approximately 0.2 million and 1.4 million shares at an average price of $146.65 and $122.31 per share, respectively. As of June 29, 2019, we had used approximately $12.6 billion of the share repurchase authority, including transaction costs, to repurchase shares, leaving $1.4 billion of authority available for future repurchases.


Dividends

During the second quarter of 2019, we paid $94 million in cash dividends to holders of our common stock. During the first half of 2019, we paid $187 million in cash dividends to holders of our common stock. Subsequent to quarter end, we paid an additional $94 million in cash dividends to holders of our common stock. 

Long-Term Customer Financing Commitments

We had outstanding commitments to provide long-term financing to third parties totaling $53 million at June 29, 2019, compared to $62 million at December 31, 2018. 

Other Contingencies

There were no significant changes impacting our commitments and contingencies during the three months ended June 29, 2019.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20) - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans,” which modifies the disclosure requirements for the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans. The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2021 with early adoption permitted. The ASU requires a retrospective adoption method. We do not believe the ASU will have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures.


Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. This was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-01, “Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842,” ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases,” and ASU No. 2018-11, “Targeted Improvements” (collectively "ASC 842"). ASC 842 establishes a right-of-use model ("ROU") that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with an initial term longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and presentation of expense recognition in the income statement.

We adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at January 1, 2019, the date of the initial application. Consequently, financial information will not be updated and disclosures required under ASC 842 will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019.

ASC 842 provides for a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the practical expedients, which permit us to not reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs under ASC 842. We did not elect the "use-of hindsight" practical expedient to determine the lease term or in assessing the likelihood that a lease purchase option will be exercised, allowing us to carry forward the lease term as determined prior to adoption of ASC 842. Finally, we also elected the practical expedient related to land easements, which enabled us to continue our accounting treatment for land easements on existing agreements as of January 1, 2019.

ASC 842 also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. A short-term lease is one with a term of 12 months or less, including any optional periods that are reasonably certain of exercise. For those leases that qualify, the exemption allows us to not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, including not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases at transition. Short-term lease costs are recognized as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term consistent with our prior accounting. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all current lease categories. 

As of January 1, 2019, we recognized operating lease liabilities of $648 million based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments determined under prior lease accounting standards and corresponding ROU assets of $588 million. The $60 million difference between operating lease liabilities and ROU assets recognized is due to deferred rent and exit cost accruals recorded under prior lease accounting standards. ASC 842 requires such balances to be reclassified against ROU assets at transition.




Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Derivative Financial Instruments

As of June 29, 2019, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $1.0 billion, compared to $819 million outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Management believes that these financial instruments should not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should generally offset gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions.
