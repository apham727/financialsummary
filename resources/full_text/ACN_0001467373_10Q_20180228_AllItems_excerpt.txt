NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017.

The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2018. 

Allowances for Client Receivables and Unbilled Services

As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were $52,236 and $74,450, respectively. 

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation expense was $107,445 and $213,596 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, and $84,639 and $169,659 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, respectively. As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, total accumulated depreciation was $2,042,405 and $1,912,146, respectively. Deferred transition amortization expense was $71,288 and $153,142 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, and $69,844 and $139,129 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, respectively. See Note 5 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) for intangible asset amortization balances.

6. MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Dividends 



The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units. 

Subsequent Event

On March 21, 2018, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.33 per share on its Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on April 12, 2018 payable on May 15, 2018. The payment of the cash dividend will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.

7. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. 

Cash Flow Hedges

For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 3 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Other Derivatives

Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net gains of $56,316 and $46,783 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, and a net gain of $19,780 and a net loss of $118,313 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. 

ACCENTURE PLC

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)



Fair Value of Derivative Instruments






On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. The Tax Act could modestly impact our ongoing effective tax rate by imposing taxes on our intercompany transactions and limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses. 

Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we have recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of February 28, 2018. We recognized a provisional tax expense of $136,724 primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new, lower rates. As we collect and analyze data, including our forecast of when we expect to realize certain deferred tax amounts, we may adjust the provisional amounts. In addition, we have not yet made an accounting policy election to consider the taxes on our intercompany transactions in determining the amount of our valuation allowance. Those adjustments and the election may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. 

We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting

from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. 

Our effective tax rates for the three months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 were 26.1% and 20.7%, respectively. Our effective tax rates for the six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 were 23.0% and 20.5%, respectively. Excluding the provisional tax expense, described above, the effective tax rates would have been 15.1% and 18.0% for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final determinations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018. 

9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Commitments 

We have either the right to purchase at fair value or, if certain events occur, may be required to purchase at fair value outstanding shares of our Avanade Inc. and SinnerSchrader AG subsidiaries. As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, we have reflected the fair value of $93,358 and $52,996, respectively, related to redeemable common stock and the intrinsic value of the options on redeemable common stock of these subsidiaries in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Indemnifications and Guarantees

In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which it may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. 

As of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $872,000 and $697,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $154,000 and $149,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. 


Legal Contingencies


ACCENTURE PLC

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)








On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc. Accenture Holdings plc dissolved and all assets and liabilities were transferred to Accenture plc. Each ordinary shareholder of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture plc and Accenture Holdings plc) received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for every ordinary share in Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc held by such shareholders. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the ownership interests in Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by certain current and former members of Accenture Leadership as noncontrolling interests. Prior to the merger, a 4% non-controlling ownership interest percentage was held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. and subsequent to the merger, the non-controlling ownership percentage is less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017.

We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2018” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2018. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.

We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include, but are not limited to:

•Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity.

•Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.

•If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.


•The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively.

•Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies.

•Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

•Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

•Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.

•Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.

•We might not be successful at identifying, acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses.

•Our global delivery capability is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.

•As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.

•Adverse changes to our relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of our key alliance partners could adversely affect our results of operations.

•If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected.

•Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.

•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.

•We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results.


•Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.

•We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us.

•We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.

•Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.

For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2017. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

Overview

Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. 

Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. 




As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 6% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 4.0% higher in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.


and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.


Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 29.7%, compared with 30.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2018 was 30.9%, compared with 31.1% for the six months ended February 28, 2017. The decrease in gross margin for three and six months ended February 28, 2018 was principally due to lower consulting contract profitability as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies.

Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and 16.4% for the six months ended February 28, 2018, compared with 16.4% for both the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and six months ended February 28, 2017. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 10 basis points and were flat, respectively, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were flat and decreased 10 basis points, respectively.

Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Net revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 13.4%, compared with 13.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Operating margin for the six months ended February 28, 2018 was 14.5%, compared with 14.7% for the six months ended February 28, 2017. 

The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 were 26.1% and 23.0%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2017 were 20.7% and 20.5%, respectively. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). Absent this charge, our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 would have been 15.1% and 18.0%, respectively. For additional information see Note 8 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.

Diluted earnings per share were $1.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.33 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $3.16 for the six months ended February 28, 2018, compared with $2.91 for the six months ended February 28, 2017. The $137 million charge associated with the Tax Act decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.21 in both the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and six months ended February 28, 2018. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.58 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and $3.37 for the six months ended February 28, 2018. 

New Bookings

New bookings for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $10.25 billion, with consulting bookings of $5.65 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.60 billion. New bookings for the six months ended February 28, 2018 were $20.23 billion, with consulting bookings of $11.59 billion and outsourcing bookings of $8.65 billion.

Geographic Regions

•North America net revenues increased 8% in local currency, driven by the United States.

•Europe net revenues increased 10% in local currency, driven by Germany, Italy, France and Spain.

•Growth Markets net revenues increased 15% in local currency, led by Japan, as well as Australia, Brazil and Singapore.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1,162 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 87.3% from 87.0% during this period. Operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1,124 million, or 16%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 86.6% from 86.3% during this period.

Cost of Services

Cost of services for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $961 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 71.7% from 71.4% during this period. Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $924 million, or 16%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 70.3% from 69.9% during this period. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased to 29.7% from 30.1% during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in gross margin was principally due to lower consulting contract profitability as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $128 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 10.4% from 10.5% during this period. 

General and Administrative Costs 

General and administrative costs for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $72 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 5.9% during this period. 

Operating Income and Operating Margin

Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $144 million, or 13%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017.





•Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability.


•Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.

•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.

Other Income (Expense), net 

Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies. For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, other expense increased $31 million over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses. 

Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 26.1%, compared with 20.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million charge associated with the enactment of the Tax Act. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 would have been 15.1%. The effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final determinations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018. For additional information see Note 8 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.

In addition, as described in Note 1 (Basis of Presentation), beginning in fiscal 2019 we will recognize incremental income tax expense as a result of adoption of ASU 2016-16.

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $7 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017.

Earnings Per Share

Diluted earnings per share were $1.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.33 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The $0.04 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $137 million charge associated with the Tax Act, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.21. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $0.25 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2017, due to increases of $0.17 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.10 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from higher non-operating expense and $0.01 from higher net income attributable to other non-controlling interests. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”

Cost of services before reimbursable expenses for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased $1,609 million or 14% over the six months ended February 28, 2017, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 69.1% from 68.9% during this period. Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2018 decreased to 30.9% from 31.1% during the six months ended February 28, 2017. The decrease in gross margin was principally due to lower consulting contract profitability as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expense for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased $241 million, or 14%, over the six months ended February 28, 2017, and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 10.5% during this period.

General and Administrative Costs 

General and administrative costs for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased $128 million, or 13%, over the six months ended February 28, 2017, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 5.9% from 6.0% during this period. 

Operating Income and Operating Margin

Operating income for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased $298 million, or 12%, over the six months ended February 28, 2017.

•Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.


•Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.

•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.

Other Income (Expense), net 

Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies. For the six months ended February 28, 2018, other expense increased $23 million over the six months ended February 28, 2017, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses. 

Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2018 was 23.0%, compared with 20.5% for the six months ended February 28, 2017. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million charge associated with the enactment of the Tax Act. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2018 would have been 18.0%. The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final determinations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018. For additional information see Note 8 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.

 Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2018 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Excluding the charge associated with the Tax 

Act, we expect the fiscal 2018 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year.

In addition, as described in Note 1 (Basis of Presentation), beginning in fiscal 2019 we will recognize incremental income tax expense as a result of adoption of ASU 2016-16.

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased $17 million, or 16%, over the six months ended February 28, 2017.

Earnings Per Share

Diluted earnings per share were $3.16 for the six months ended February 28, 2018, compared with $2.91 for the six months ended February 28, 2017. The $0.25 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $137 million charge associated with the Tax Act, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the six months ended February 28, 2018 by $0.21. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased $0.46 compared with the six months ended February 28, 2017, due to increases of $0.36 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.10 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.03 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from higher net income attributable to other non-controlling interests and $0.01 from higher non-operating expenses. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of February 28, 2018, Cash and cash equivalents was $3.6 billion, compared with $4.1 billion as of August 31, 2017.

We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. 

Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. 

Borrowing Facilities



Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $246 million of letters of credit outstanding as of February 28, 2018. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into agreements that will allow us to establish a commercial paper program for short-term borrowings of up to $1 billion, backed by our syndicated loan facility.  

Share Purchases and Redemptions

The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.







Other Share Redemptions

During the six months ended February 28, 2018, we issued 351,804 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the “registration statement”). The registration statement allowed us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. In connection with the merger of Accenture Holdings plc with and into Accenture plc, we have terminated the registration statement.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

Purchases and Redemptions of Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares and Class X Ordinary Shares

The following table provides information relating to our purchases of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and redemptions of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. In connection with the merger of Accenture Holdings plc with and into Accenture plc on March 13, 2018, the Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares held by Accenture Holdings plc shareholders were redeemed. For additional information, see Note 11 (Subsequent Event) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.





Purchases and Redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc Ordinary Shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares

The following table provides additional information relating to our purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We believe that the following table and footnotes provide useful information regarding the share purchase and redemption activity of Accenture. Generally, purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash and employee forfeitures reduce shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share. However, in connection with the merger of Accenture Holdings plc with and into Accenture plc on March 13, 2018, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture plc and Accenture Holdings plc) received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned. Accordingly, as of March 13, 2018, there were no longer any ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc outstanding. For additional information, see Note 11 (Subsequent Event) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.
