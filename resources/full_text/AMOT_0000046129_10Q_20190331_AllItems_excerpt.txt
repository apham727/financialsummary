1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION 

Allied Motion Technologies Inc. (Allied Motion or the Company) is engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing and selling controlled motion solutions, which include integrated system solutions as well as individual controlled motion products, to a broad spectrum of customers throughout the world primarily for the industrial, automotive, medical, and aerospace and defense markets. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

The assets and liabilities of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using end of period exchange rates. Changes in reported amounts of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that occur as a result of changes in exchange rates between foreign subsidiaries functional currencies and the U.S. dollar are included in foreign currency translation adjustment. Foreign currency translation adjustment is included in other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders equity. Revenue and expense transactions use an average rate prevailing during the month of the related transaction. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of each of the Technology Units (TUs) are included in the results of operations as incurred. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and include all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The Company believes that the disclosures herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The financial data for the interim periods may not necessarily be indicative of results to be expected for the year. 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

It is suggested that the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to such statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 that was previously filed by the Company. 

Reclassifications 

Certain items in the prior years condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation. 


TCI 

On December 6, 2018, the Company entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with TCI, LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company (TCI), and the members of TCI (Sellers), pursuant to which Allied Motion acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common units of TCI from Sellers (the Acquisition) in a transaction valued at $64,100. The Acquisition consideration is subject to adjustments based on a determination of closing net working capital, cash, indebtedness and other TCI liabilities. A portion of the Acquisition consideration was placed in escrow to secure payment of any post-closing adjustments to the purchase price and to secure the Sellers indemnification obligations to Allied Motion. Cash consideration was funded from borrowings on the Companys existing credit facilities. 

The TCI acquisition broadens and strengthens the Companys position as a leading global diversified solutions provider in the controlled motion market. TCI has adjacent technologies and capabilities that enable more efficient and longer life 


Table of Contents 

ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES INC. 

UNAUDITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


solutions for motion devices in a wide variety of demanding applications. TCIs technology and products are expected to be a valuable addition to the Companys expanding suite of solution offerings. 



The purchase price excluded any cash on hand and any debt of TCI. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary as the valuation of both the tangible and identifiable intangible assets is being finalized. 

The intangible assets acquired consist of customer lists, technology and a trade name, which are being amortized over 16, 15 and 19 years, respectively. Goodwill generated in the acquisition is related to the assembled workforce, synergies between Allied Motions other TUs and TCI that are expected to occur as a result of the combined engineering knowledge, the ability of each of the TUs to integrate each others products into more fully integrated system solutions and Allied Motions ability to utilize TCIs management knowledge in providing complementary product offerings to the Companys customers. 

The goodwill resulting from the TCI acquisition is tax deductible. 

Pro forma Condensed Combined Financial Information 



The pro forma adjustments do not reflect adjustments for anticipated operating efficiencies that the Company expects to achieve as a result of this acquisition. The pro forma financial information is for informational purposes only and does not purport to present what the Companys results would actually have been had these transactions actually occurred on the date presented or to project the combined companys results of operations or financial position for any future period. 

Maval OE Steering 

On January 19, 2018, the Company purchased substantially all of the operating assets associated with the original equipment steering business of Maval Industries, LLC (Maval) for $13,312 in cash. Consistent with the Companys strategy to provide higher level system solutions, the addition of the Maval OE steering (Maval OE Steering) product line enables Allied to provide a fully integrated steering system solution to its customers.

ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES INC. 

UNAUDITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 




Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The purchase price allocation was completed during the fourth quarter 2018. 

The goodwill resulting from the Maval OE Steering acquisition is tax deductible. 


Performance Obligations 

Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time 


The Company satisfies its performance obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring goods and services in exchange for monetary consideration from the customer. The Company considers the customers purchase order, and the Companys corresponding sales order acknowledgment as the contract with the customer. For some customers, control, and a sale, is transferred at a point in time when the product is delivered to a customer. 

Sales, value add, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. 

Nature of Goods and Services 


Determining the Transaction Price 

The majority of the Companys contracts have an original duration of less than one year. For these contracts, the Company applies the practical expedient and therefore does not consider the effects of the time value of money. For multiyear contracts, the Company uses judgment to determine whether there is a significant financing component. These contracts are generally those in which the customer has made an up-front payment. Contracts that management determines to include a significant financing component are discounted at the Companys incremental borrowing rate. The Company incurs interest expense and accrues a contract liability. As the Company satisfies performance obligations and recognizes revenue from these contracts, interest expense is recognized simultaneously. Management does not have any contracts that include a significant financing component as of March 31, 2019. 


Table of Contents 

ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES INC. 

UNAUDITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


Disaggregation of Revenue 

The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers into geographical regions and target markets. The Company determines that disaggregating revenue into these categories achieves the disclosure objective to depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. As noted in the Segment Information footnote, the Companys business consists of one reportable segment. A reconciliation of disaggregated revenue to segment revenue as well as revenue by geographical regions is provided in Note 16, Segment Information. 



Contract Balances 

When the timing of the Companys delivery of product is different from the timing of the payments made by customers, the Company recognizes either a contract asset (performance precedes customer payment) or a contract liability (customer payment precedes performance). Typically, contracts are paid in arrears and are recognized as receivables after the Company considers whether a significant financing component exists. 




The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Companys contract assets and contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between the Companys performance and the customers payment. 


Table of Contents 

ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES INC. 

UNAUDITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


Significant Payment Terms 

The Companys contracts with its customers state the final terms of the sale, including the description, quantity, and price of each product or service purchased. Payments are typically due in full within 30-60 days of delivery. Since the customer agrees to a stated rate and price in the contract that do not vary over the contract, the majority of contracts do not contain variable consideration. 

Returns, Refunds, and Warranties 

In the normal course of business, the Company does not accept product returns unless the item is defective as manufactured. The Company establishes provisions for estimated returns and warranties. All contracts include a standard warranty clause to guarantee that the product complies with agreed specifications. 

Practical Expedients 

Incremental costs of obtaining a contract - the Company elected to expense the incremental costs of obtaining a contract when the amortization period for such contracts would have been one year or less. 

Remaining performance obligations - the Company elected not to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for its contracts that are one year or less, as the revenue is expected to be recognized within the next year. 

The time value of money - the Company elected not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money for contracts in which the anticipated period between when the Company transfers the goods or services to the customer and when the customer pays is equal to one year or less. 




5. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 



Depreciation expense was approximately $2,227 and $1,907 for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 


Table of Contents 

ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES INC.

Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of TCI were approximately $36,400 (Note 2). The intangible assets acquired consist of customer lists, a trade name and technology. The valuation and useful life of the purchased intangibles has not been finalized. 

Intangible assets from the acquisition of the Maval OE Steering business were approximately $3,870 (Note 2). The intangible assets acquired consist of customer lists. 

Amortization expense for intangible assets was $1,432 and $884 for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively.

Stock Incentive Plans 

The Companys Stock Incentive Plans provide for the granting of stock awards, including restricted stock, stock options and stock appreciation rights, to employees and non-employees, including directors of the Company. 

Restricted Stock 

For the quarter ended March 31, 2019, 97,430 shares of unvested restricted stock were awarded at a weighted average market value of $42.24. Of the restricted shares granted, 76,629 shares have performance-based vesting conditions. The value of the shares is amortized to compensation expense over the related service period, which is normally three years, or over the estimated performance period. Shares of unvested restricted stock are generally forfeited if a recipient leaves the Company before the vesting date. Shares that are forfeited become available for future awards. 



Stock based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $674 and $496 was recorded for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility 

On October 28, 2016, the Company entered into a $125,000 revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility), with an initial term of five years. 

On December 6, 2018, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement to exercise the $50 million accordion feature of its existing senior secured revolving credit facility and to add TCI as an additional guarantor. The Companys credit facility, which matures in October 2021, increased capacity from $125 million to $175 million with the additional borrowing capacity being provided by the existing lenders. Other terms and conditions under the credit facility remain unchanged. At March 31, 2019 there was approximately $45,498 available under the Revolving Credit Facility. 

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% or the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin of 0% to 1.25%, in each case depending on the Companys ratio of total funded indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to Consolidated trailing twelve-month EBITDA (the Total Leverage Ratio). At March 31, 2019, the applicable margin for LIBOR Rate borrowings was 2.00% and the applicable margin for Prime Rate borrowings was 1.00%. In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of between 0.10% and 0.25% quarterly (currently 0.220%) on the unused portion of the Revolving facility, also based on the Companys Total Leverage Ratio. The Revolving Facility is secured by substantially all of the Companys non-realty assets and is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of the Companys subsidiaries. 

The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to minimum interest coverage and total leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. The Credit Agreement also includes other covenants and restrictions, including limits on the amount of additional indebtedness, and restrictions on the Companys ability to merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2019. 

Other 

The China Credit Facility provides credit of approximately $1,490 (Chinese Renminbi 10,000) (the China Facility). The China Facility is used for working capital and capital equipment needs at the Companys China operations. There have been no borrowings during 2019 and there is no balance in the China Facility at March 31, 2019. There were no borrowings during the fourth quarter of 2018 and therefore no balance in the China Facility as of December 31, 2018. 

11. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Companys derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Companys known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Companys investments and borrowings. 

The Companys objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. During October 2013, the Company entered into two identical interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 that amortized quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at the September 2018 maturity. Neither of these interest rate swaps is currently active as the Company terminated one interest rate swap during October 2016 as part of its debt refinancing, and the second matured September 2018. In February 2017, the Company entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022. 


Table of Contents 

ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES INC. 

UNAUDITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During 2019 and 2018, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. There was no hedge ineffectiveness recorded in the Companys earnings during the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. 

The Company estimates that an additional $160 will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense over the next twelve months. Additionally, the Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges.

The tables below present a gross presentation, the effects of offsetting, and a net presentation of the Companys derivatives as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The net amounts of derivative assets or liabilities can be reconciled to the tabular disclosure of fair value. The tabular disclosure of fair value provides the location that derivative assets and liabilities are presented on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 



The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company either defaults or is capable of being declared in default on any of its indebtedness, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. 


Authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 

The guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value which utilizes observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Companys market assumptions. Preference is given to observable inputs. 





The Companys financial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, debt obligations, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. The carrying amounts reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for these assets approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturities of these financial instruments.

The income tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of the annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, the estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if the estimated effective tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made. There is a potential for volatility of the effective tax rate due to several factors, including changes in the mix of the pre-tax income and the jurisdictions to which it relates, changes in tax laws, settlements with taxing authorities and foreign currency fluctuations. 

The effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes was 27.5% and 26.2% in the first quarter 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate is net of a discrete tax benefit of (1.8%) and (2.3%), rate for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 respectively, related primarily to the recognition of excess tax benefits for share-based payment awards. 

The effective rate before discrete items varies from the statutory rate primarily due to differences in state taxes, the impact of international tax provisions in the US, the difference in foreign tax rates and the mix of foreign and domestic income. The increase in the effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income taxes from first quarter 2018 to 2019 is a result of limited deductibility of Executive Compensation and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, both of which are on-going provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted on December 22, 2017. 



Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), requires the Company to recognize a right of use (ROU) asset and a lease liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months. Refer to Note 19  Recent Accounting Pronouncements for discussion on the adoption of Topic 842.

17. EARNINGS PER SHARE 



For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the anti-dilutive common shares excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share were immaterial. 


The Company operates in one segment for the manufacture and marketing of controlled motion products for original 

equipment manufacturers and end user applications. The Companys chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer and President, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Existing guidance, which is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about products and services in which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. 



Identifiable foreign assets were $91,478 and $88,400 as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.Revenues derived from foreign subsidiaries and identifiable assets outside of the United States are primarily attributable to Europe. 

Sales to customers outside of the United States by all subsidiaries were $43,680 and $36,302 during the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

For first quarter 2019 and 2018, one customer accounted for 16% and 21% of revenues, respectively. As of March 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018 this customer represented 20% and 13% of trade receivables, respectively. 

19. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, to address a specific consequence of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) by allowing a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Acts reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. The ASU is effective for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Act is recognized. 


Table of Contents 

ALLIED MOTION TECHNOLOGIES INC. 

UNAUDITED NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months and also requires disclosures by lessees and lessors about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. Subsequent to the issuance of Topic 842, the FASB clarified the guidance through several ASUs; hereinafter the collection of lease guidance is referred to as ASC 842. 


As a result of the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 842, the Company recorded operating lease ROU assets of $19,728 and operating lease liabilities of $20,350 as of January 1, 2019, primarily related to real estate, equipment and automobile leases, based on the present value of the future lease payments on the date of adoption. Refer to Note 14 - Leases for the additional disclosures required by ASC 842. 

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. ROU assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Companys leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also consists of any prepaid lease payments and deferred rent liabilities. The lease terms used to calculate the ROU asset and related lease liability include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense. The Company has lease agreements which require payments for lease and non-lease components and has elected to account for these as a single lease component. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements 

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), which modifies the disclosures on fair value measurements by removing the requirement to disclose the amount and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the policy for timing of such transfers. The ASU expands the disclosure requirements for Level 3 fair value measurements, primarily focused on changes in unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income (loss). The ASU is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Management has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new standard on the Companys financial statements.

Operating Results 

Quarter ended March 31, 2019 compared to quarter ended March 31, 2018 






Table of Contents 

Sales to U.S. customers were 54% of total sales for the first quarter 2019 compared with 53% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia. The overall increase in revenue was due to an 27% volume increase offset by a 4% unfavorable currency impact. 









Non-GAAP Measures 

Revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. 

Management believes the presentation of these financial measures reflecting non-GAAP adjustments provides important supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results; in particular, those charges and credits that are not directly related to operating unit performance, and that are not a helpful measure of the performance of our underlying business particularly in light of their unpredictable nature. These non-GAAP disclosures have limitations as analytical tools, should not be viewed as a substitute for revenue and net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as 


Table of Contents 

a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. In addition, supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Companys future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. 

The Company believes that revenue excluding foreign currency exchange impacts is a useful measure in analyzing organic sales results. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from revenue for this measure because currency translation is not under managements control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between the current period revenue and the current period revenue after applying foreign exchange rates from the prior period. 

The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense. EBITDA is frequently used as one of the bases for comparing businesses in the Companys industry. 

The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business. Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock compensation expense, as well as certain income or expenses which are not indicative of the ongoing performance of the Company. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Companys liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1,511 to a balance of $10,184 at March 31, 2019 from December 31, 2018. 


During the first quarter of 2019, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to an increase in working capital needs to support the sequential quarter, primarily for trade receivables. 

The significant cash used in investing activities in the first quarter 2018 reflects the acquisition the Maval OE Steering business. Purchases of property and equipment were $2,505 during the first quarter 2019 compared to $2,222 for the first quarter 2018. Capital expenditures are expected to increase for the remainder of 2019 to support our continued growth. The Company expects to invest between $15 million and $18 million in capital expenditures during 2019. 

During 2019, the Company utilized revolver borrowings to fund working capital to support the growth seen from fourth quarter 2018 along with the payment of annual incentive compensation amounts. The cash used in financing activities in first quarter 2018 reflects the use of the revolver to partially finance the acquisition of the Maval OE Steering business. At March 31, 2019, we had $129,502 of obligations under the Revolving Facility excluding the unamortized debt issue costs. 

The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to minimum interest coverage and total leverage ratio at the end of each quarter. The Credit Agreement also includes other covenants and restrictions, including limits on the amount of additional indebtedness, and restrictions on the ability to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all our assets. We were in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2019. 

As of March 31, 2019, the amount available to borrow under the Credit Agreement was approximately $45,498. The Credit Agreement matures in October 2021. 

There were no borrowings for the China Facility balance during the quarter ended March 31, 2019. 

The Company declared dividends of $0.030 per share during the first quarter 2019 and $0.025 per share during the first quarter of 2018. The Companys working capital, capital expenditure and dividend requirements are expected to be funded from cash provided by operations and amounts available under the Credit Agreement. 

Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Foreign Currency 

We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Czech Republic, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Czech Krona, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively. We continuously evaluate our foreign currency risk and will take action from time to time in order to best mitigate these risks. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately $3,500 on our first quarter 2019 sales. This amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to partially offsetting impacts on cost of sales and operating expenses in those currencies. We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter ended March 31, 2019 decreased sales in comparison to quarter ended March 31, 2018 by approximately $3,100. 

We translate all assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency, at the period-end exchange rate and translate sales and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income. The translation adjustment was a loss of approximately $900 and a gain of approximately $600 for the first quarter 


Table of Contents 

of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Translation adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to approximately a loss of $100 and $138 for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,700 on our foreign net assets as of March 31, 2019. 

Interest Rates 

Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 2.0%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 1.0%), in each case depending on the Companys ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA. We use interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 that amortized quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at the September 2018 maturity. Neither of these interest rate swaps is currently active, one was liquidated as part of the 2016 debt refinancing and the other matured in September 2018. In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022. 

As of March 31, 2019, we had $129,502 outstanding under the Revolving Facility, of which $40,000 is currently being hedged. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our outstanding debt. A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) change in the Base Rate on the $85,462 of unhedged floating rate debt outstanding at March 31, 2019 would have approximately a $200 impact on our interest expense for the first quarter of 2019.
