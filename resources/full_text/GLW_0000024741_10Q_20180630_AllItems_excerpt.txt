 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

 (Unaudited)  

 1. Significant Accounting Policies  

 ﻿  

 Basis of Presentation  

 ﻿  

 In these notes, the terms “Corning,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Corning Incorporated and its subsidiary companies.  

 ﻿  

 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted or condensed. These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with Corning’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (“2017 Form 10-K”).  

 ﻿  

 The unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results which may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year.  

 ﻿  

 On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09 ASC (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and applied the modified retrospective method of accounting to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC Topic 605 “Revenue Recognition”. Because the impact of adopting the standard on Corning’s financial statements was immaterial, we have not made an adjustment to opening retained earnings.  

 ﻿  

 One of Corning’s equity affiliates is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on its financial statements and will adopt the standard on January 1, 2019. Preliminary analysis indicates that the impact of adoption will not have a material impact on Corning’s financial statements.  

 ﻿  


 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on our results of operations, financial position, or changes in shareholders’ equity.   

 ﻿  

 New Accounting Standards   

 ﻿  

 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes all existing guidance on accounting for leases in ASC Topic 840. ASU 2016-02 will continue to classify leases as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of income. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2016-02 is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented with various optional practical expedients. We are currently assessing the potential impact of adopting this standard on our financial statements and related disclosures.

 Index  

 One of Corning’s equity affiliates is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting this standard on its financial statements and elected to adopt the standard on January 1, 2020.  

 ﻿  

 In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, which allows for reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. ASU 2018-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2018-02 on our financial statements.   

 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customer”, and all related amendments, using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC Topic 605 “Revenue Recognition”.   

 ﻿  

 We have determined that the impact of transition to the new standard is immaterial to our revenue recognition model since the vast majority of our recognition is based on point in time transfer of control. Accordingly, we have not made any adjustment to opening retained earnings.  

 ﻿  

 Product Revenue (Point in Time)  

 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Sales tax, value-added tax, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. Incidental contract costs that are not material in the context of the delivery of goods and services are recognized as expense.  

 ﻿  

 At the time revenue is recognized, allowances are recorded, with the related reduction to revenue, for estimated product returns, allowances and price discounts based upon historical experience and related terms of customer arrangements. Where we have offered product warranties, we also establish liabilities for estimated warranty costs based upon historical experience and specific warranty provisions. Warranty liabilities are adjusted when experience indicates the expected outcome will differ from initial estimates of the liability. Product warranty liabilities are not material at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.  

 ﻿  

 Other Revenue (Over Time)  

 ﻿  

 Corning’s over time revenues are mainly related to Telecommunications products, and are comprised of design, install, training and software maintenance services. The performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time, resulting in either a straight-line amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligation. Corning’s other revenue is inconsequential to our results.

Revenue Disaggregation Table  

 ﻿  

 The following table shows revenues by major product categories, similar to our reportable segment disclosure. Within each product category, contract terms, conditions and economic factors affecting the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty around revenue recognition and cash flows are substantially similar. The commercial markets and selling channels are also similar. With the exception of an inconsequential amount of Telecommunications products, our product category revenues are recognized at point in time when control transfers to the customer. Prior year amounts are presented under the ASC 605 basis of revenue recognition.   

 ﻿  


 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 ﻿  

 Contract Assets and Liabilities  

 ﻿  

 Contract assets, such as costs to obtain or fulfill contracts, are an insignificant component of Corning’s revenue recognition process. The majority of Corning’s cost of fulfillment as a manufacturer of products is classified as inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets, which are accounted for under the respective guidance for those asset types. Other costs of contract fulfillment are immaterial due to the nature of our products and their respective manufacturing processes.   

 ﻿  

 Contract liabilities include deferred revenues, other advanced payments and customer deposits. Deferred revenue and other advanced payments are not significant to our operations and are classified as part of other current liabilities in our financial statements. Customer deposits are predominately related to Display products and are classified as part of other current liabilities and other long- term liabilities as appropriate, and are disclosed below.   

 ﻿  

 Customer Deposits  

 ﻿  

 As of June 30, 2018, Corning has customer deposits of approximately $1.0 billion, of which $576 million was received in the first half of 2018. These represent non-refundable cash deposits for customers to secure rights to an amount of glass produced by Corning under long-term supply agreements. The duration of these long-term supply agreements range up to ten years. As glass is shipped to customers, Corning will recognize revenue and issue credit memoranda to reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability, which are applied against customer receivables resulting from the sale of glass. In 2018 and 2017, no credit memoranda were issued.   

Practical Expedients and Exemptions  

 ﻿  

 We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.  

 ﻿  

 We treat shipping and handling fees as a fulfillment cost and not as a separate performance obligation under the terms of our revenue contracts due to the perfunctory nature of the shipping and handling obligations.

3. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees  

 ﻿  

 Asbestos Claims  

 ﻿  

 Corning and PPG Industries, Inc. each owned 50% of the capital stock of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (“PCC”). PCC filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in 2000 and the Modified Third Amended Plan of Reorganization for PCC (the “Plan”) became effective in April 2016. At December 31, 2016, the Company’s liability under the Plan was $290 million, which is required to be paid through a series of fixed payments beginning in the second quarter of 2017. Payments of $35 million and $70 million were made in June 2018 and June 2017, respectively. At June 30, 2018, the total amount of payments due in years 2019 through 2022 is $185 million, of which $50 million is due in the second quarter of 2019 and is classified as a current liability. The remaining $135 million is classified as a non-current liability.  

 ﻿  

 Non-PCC Asbestos Claims and Insurance Litigation  

 ﻿  

 Corning is a defendant in certain cases alleging injuries from asbestos unrelated to PCC (the “non-PCC asbestos claims”) which had been stayed pending the confirmation of the Plan. The stay was lifted on August 25, 2016. Corning previously established a $150 million reserve for these non-PCC asbestos claims. The estimated reserve represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees over the next 20 years. The amount may need to be adjusted in future periods as more data becomes available; however, we cannot estimate any lesser or greater liability at this time. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the amount of the reserve for these non-PCC asbestos claims was $147 million.  

 ﻿  

 Several of Corning’s insurers have commenced litigation in state courts for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies related to Corning’s asbestos claims. Corning has resolved these issues with a majority of its relevant insurers, and is vigorously contesting these cases with the remaining relevant insurers. Management is unable to predict the outcome of the litigation with these remaining insurers.  

 ﻿  

 Dow Corning Chapter 11 Related Matters  

 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 Dow Corning Breast Implant Litigation  

 ﻿  

 In May 1995, Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits.  On June 1, 2004, Dow Corning emerged from Chapter 11 with a Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”) which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims.  The Plan also includes releases for Corning and Dow as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the Plan.  

 ﻿  

 Under the terms of the Plan, Dow Corning has established and is funding a Settlement Trust and a Litigation Facility to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims.  Inclusive of insurance, Dow Corning has paid approximately $1.8 billion to the Settlement Trust. As of May 31, 2016, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of $290 million. In the event Dow Corning’s total liability for these claims exceeds such amount, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow Corning for up to 50% of the excess liability. At June 30, 2018, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of $263 million.

 Index  

 Dow Corning Bankruptcy Pendency Interest Claims  

 ﻿  

 As a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings, Dow Corning is defending claims asserted by a number of commercial creditors who claim additional interest at default rates and enforcement costs, during the period from May 1995 through June 2004. As of May 31, 2016, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for these claims of $107 million. In the event Dow Corning’s liability for these claims exceeds such amount, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow Corning for up to 50% of the excess liability, subject to certain conditions and limits. At June 30, 2018, Dow Corning estimated the liability to commercial creditors to be within the range of $77 million to $260 million.   

 ﻿  

 Other Commitments and Contingencies  

 ﻿  

 Corning is a defendant in various lawsuits, including environmental and product-related suits, and is subject to various claims that arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on Corning’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, is remote. Other than certain asbestos related claims, there are no other material loss contingencies related to litigation.  

 ﻿  

 Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (“the Agency”) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Corning had accrued approximately $35 million and $38 million (undiscounted) for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.  

 ﻿  

 The ability of certain subsidiaries and affiliated companies to transfer funds is limited by provisions of foreign government regulations, affiliate agreements and certain loan agreements. At June 30, 2018, the amount of equity subject to such restrictions for consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies was not significant. While this amount is legally restricted, it does not result in operational difficulties since we have generally permitted subsidiaries to retain a majority of equity to support their growth programs.  


 ﻿  

 Based on borrowing rates currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of long-term debt was $5.2 billion and $5.1 billion at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to recorded book values of $5.1 billion at June 30, 2018 and $4.7 billion at December 31, 2017. The Company measures the fair value of its long-term debt using Level 2 inputs based primarily on current market yields for its existing debt traded in the secondary market.  

 ﻿  

 Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.  

 ﻿  

 Debt Issuances  

 ﻿  



 ﻿  




 ﻿  

 The proceeds from the Notes were received in Japanese yen and converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance.  The net proceeds received in U.S. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, were $596 million. Payments of principle and interest on the Notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a U.S. dollar equivalent.

 ﻿  

 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. We are applying the guidance in SAB 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the Act. At June 30, 2018, we have not completed our accounting for all of the tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. We have made a reasonable estimate of certain effects of the 2017 Tax Act. However, in other cases, we have not been able to make a reasonable estimate and continue to account for those items based on our existing accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes, and the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to enactment. In all cases, we will continue to make and refine our calculations as additional analysis is completed. Our estimates may also be affected as we gain a more thorough understanding of the tax law. These changes could be material to income tax expense.   

 ﻿  

 At year end December 31, 2017, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. We recorded a provisional amount of $347 million at that time. At December 31, 2017, we recorded a one-time toll charge based on our unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred. This charge resulted in a provisional tax expense amount of $1.1 billion. We will continue to analyze and refine our calculations related to the measurement of these balances.   

 ﻿  

 As of June 30, 2018, Corning has not yet completed its analysis of tax reform on its assertion regarding its indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings; therefore, the Company will continue to follow its historic position while it continues to analyze this issue. While Corning is not changing its assertion at this time, the Company distributed approximately $2.2 billion during 2018 from its foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent of those subsidiaries. There are no incremental taxes beyond the toll charge due with respect to this distribution of cash.

 Index  

 Under its historic policy, Corning will continue to indefinitely reinvest substantially all of its foreign earnings, with the exception of an immaterial amount of current earnings that have very low or no tax cost associated with their repatriation. Our current analysis indicates that we have sufficient U.S. liquidity, including borrowing capacity, to fund foreseeable U.S. cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash.  

 ﻿  

 Under new guidance, a company can make a policy election to account for tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) as a period cost only or to also recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities when basis differences exist that are expected to affect the amount of GILTI inclusion upon reversal. Corning’s accounting for the impact of the GILTI provisions of the 2017 Tax Act is incomplete and, as a result, it has not yet elected a policy to account for the GILTI provisions.  

 ﻿  

 We will continue to monitor future guidance and to assess the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act.  

 ﻿  

 Corning has reached a preliminary agreement with the IRS Exam team to resolve the 2013 and 2014 audits. This agreement resulted in $172 million of additional tax expense in the first quarter of 2018, of which $12 million relates to interest expense, net of tax benefit. Corning will use tax attributes to cover most of the tax expense.

 On June 1, 2018, Corning acquired substantially all of 3M’s Communications Market Division including a manufacturing facility and certain other assets (collectively referred to as “Purchased Assets”) for approximately $794 million. The Purchased Assets constitute a business, which designs, manufactures and markets high bandwidth and optical fiber products. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.   

 ﻿  


 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 (1)The goodwill recognized is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. The goodwill was allocated to the Optical Communications segment.  

 ﻿  

 Goodwill is primarily related to the value of the Communications Market Division product and customer portfolio and its combination with Corning’s existing optical communications platform, as well as synergies and other intangibles that do not qualify for separate recognition. Other intangible assets consist mainly of customer relationships, trade names and developed technology and are amortized over various useful lives ranging from 3 to 14 years. Acquisition-related costs of $15 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 included costs for legal, accounting, valuation and other professional services and were included in selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Supplemental pro forma information was not provided because the Purchased Assets are not material to Corning’s consolidated financial statements.  

 ﻿  

 9. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   

 ﻿  



 ﻿  

 (1)The Company completed the acquisition of 3M in the Optical Communications segment during the second quarter of 2018. Refer to Note 8 (Acquisitions) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on this acquisition.  

 ﻿  

 Corning’s gross goodwill balances for the periods ended June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $8.4 and $8.2 billion, respectively. Accumulated impairment losses were $6.5 billion for the periods ended June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, and were generated primarily through goodwill impairments related to the Optical Communications segment.  

 ﻿  


 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 Corning’s amortized intangible assets are primarily related to the Optical Communications and Life Sciences segments. The net carrying amount of intangible assets increased during the first six months of 2018, primarily due to the acquisition of 3M of $511 million of other intangible assets, offset by amortization of $41 million and foreign currency translation adjustments of $7 million.  

 © 2018 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.  


 Index  

﻿  

 Amortization expense related to all intangible assets is estimated to be $112 million annually for 2019, $111 million annually for 2020, $110 million annually for 2021, $109 million annually for 2022, and $108 million annually for 2023.  

 10. Employee Retirement Plans  

 ﻿  



 ﻿  

 The components of net period benefit cost other than the service cost component are included in the line item “Other expense, net” in the consolidated statements of income.  

 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 Corning has applied the practical expedient which permits it to use the amounts disclosed in its pension and other postretirement benefit plan note for the prior comparative periods as the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements. See Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) for additional information.

 Undesignated Hedges  

 The table below includes a total gross notional value for translated earnings contracts of $14.6 billion and $14.3 billion at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. These include gross notional value for average rate forwards of $12.3 billion and $13.0 billion and zero-cost collars of $2.3 billion and $1.3 billion at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The majority of the average rate forward contracts hedge a significant portion of the Company’s exposure to the Japanese yen with maturities spanning the years 2017-2022 and with gross notional values of $10.5 billion and $11.7 billion at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The average rate forward contracts also partially hedge the impacts of the South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan, euro and British pound translation on the Company’s projected net income. With respect to the zero-cost collars, the gross notional amount includes the value of both the put and call options. However, due to the nature of the zero-cost collars, only the put or the call option can be exercised at maturity.

Share Repurchases  

 ﻿  


 In December 2016, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $4 billion share repurchase program with no expiration (the “2016 Repurchase Program”). In the year ended December 31, 2017, Corning entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements under this program (the “2017 ASR agreements”). In the second quarter of 2017, Corning entered into and finalized an accelerated share repurchase agreement under which we paid $500 million for a total of 17.1 million shares. In the third quarter of 2017, Corning entered into and finalized an additional accelerated share repurchase agreement under which we paid $500 million for a total of 17.2 million shares.  

 ﻿  

 In addition to the 2017 ASR agreements, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 50.1 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $1.4 billion, resulting in a total of 84.4 million shares repurchased for approximately $2.4 billion during 2017.  

 ﻿  


 In the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 24.6 million and 51.6 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $674 million and $1,488 million, respectively, as part of its 2016 Repurchase Program.   

 ﻿  

 On April 26, 2018, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $2 billion share repurchase program with no expiration (the “2018 Repurchase Program”). The 2018 Repurchase Program will commence when the authorization under the 2016 Repurchase Program is exhausted.  

 ﻿  

 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss   

 ﻿  

 In the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss was primarily related to the foreign currency translation adjustment.

 OVERVIEW  

 ﻿  

 Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework   

 ﻿  

 In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value. The Framework outlines our leadership priorities and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses. We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength. Under our Framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.   

 ﻿  

 Our probability of success increases as we invest in our world-class capabilities. Corning is concentrating approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms. This strategy allows us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed.   

 ﻿  

 Summary of results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018  

 ﻿  

 Net sales in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $2,747 million and $5,247 million, compared to $2,497 million and $4,872 million, respectively, in the same periods in 2017, driven by an increase in net sales in all segments. The increase in both periods was led by the Optical Communications segment, which increased $141 million and $209 million, respectively, due to higher sales of carrier network products in North American and Europe, and an increase in sales of enterprise network products from growth in data centers. Environmental Technologies segment sales increased $54 million and $101 million, respectively, driven by higher sales of all products. Life Sciences sales increased by $24 million and $46 million, respectively, driven by higher sales across all product lines. Net sales in the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments increased by $3 million and $6 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2018.

 ﻿  

   ·    An increase of $267 million in translated earnings contracts gains; 

   ·    The impact of discrete tax and other tax-related items in the amount of $49 million. These items include the release of a $28 million tax valuation reserve in the second quarter of 2018, combined with the absence of the tax impact related to the sale of investment securities and the write-off of a tax receivable due to settlement in the second quarter of 2017;  


   ·    Lower net income in the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments, down $34 million and $6 million, respectively, slightly offset the items above. 

 ﻿  

 Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.36 per share, or 86%, when compared to the second quarter of 2017, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 24.6 million shares of common stock for approximately $674 million.  

 ﻿  


 ﻿  

   ·    A $103 million charge related to legal matters, including a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in civil litigation matters; 

   ·    The preliminary agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to settle an audit in the amount of $172 million; 

   ·    Lower net income in the Display Technologies, Specialty Materials and All Other segments, down $94 million, $17 million and $30 million, respectively, and 

   ·    A decrease of $47 million in equity earnings, driven largely by the absence of a $46 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2017 resulting from the modification of long-term sales agreements with a customer of HSG. 

 ﻿  

 The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same periods in 2017.  

 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 We believe 2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and anticipate that segment net sales will reach approximately $11.3 billion, an increase from prior expectations of $11.0 billion. In our Display Technologies segment, we expect pricing to continue to improve, with year-over-year declines reaching mid-single digits in the third quarter, an important milestone toward our goal of stabilizing returns. We anticipate Corning’s LCD glass volume will grow faster than the expected LCD glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China. In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase in the high-teen percentage range with organic growth improving by a low-teen percentage range with an additional $200 million from the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers. We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, the rate of which will depend on new model launches and the adoption of our innovations. We are increasing our expectation of sales growth to the mid-teen percentage range in our Environmental Technologies segment, driven by continued strength in automotive product sales, on-going improvements in the heavy-duty diesel market and from the commercial launch of gas-particulate filters. We are increasing our expectations to mid-to-high single digit percentage growth in the Life Sciences segment.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)  

 For the three months ended June 30, 2018 comprehensive income decreased by $154 million when compared to the same period in 2017, due to the negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses of $382 million, driven primarily by the Japanese yen and the Korean won, partially offset by an increase in net income of $299 million.  

 ﻿  

 For the six months ended June 30, 2018 comprehensive (loss) income decreased by $1,044 million when compared to the same period in 2017, due to a decrease in net income of $376 million, the negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses of $568 million, driven primarily by the Japanese yen and the Korean won, and a decrease in net unrealized gains of designated hedges of $62 million.  

 ﻿  

 Refer to Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  

 CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES  

 ﻿  

 In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to arrive at core performance measures. These items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates. Additionally, Corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and New Taiwan dollar currencies. The Company believes that the use of constant currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations, and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows. Corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.   

 ﻿  

 These measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”). We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures. With respect to the Company’s outlooks for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast the movement of the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan or New Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control. As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.  

 ﻿  

 See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for details on core performance measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” below.

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures  

 We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows.  

 ﻿  

 Core net sales, core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core earnings are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the Company’s operations.

 All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.” This group is primarily comprised of the results of the pharmaceutical technologies business and new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates.   


 ﻿  

 We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist the CODM in making internal operating decisions. We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment’s net income. We have allocated certain common expenses among reportable segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information. Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.   

 ﻿  

 Display Technologies  


 ﻿  

 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $3 million, and decreased by $34 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. LCD glass price declines essentially offset increased sales volume for the second quarter of 2018. Net sales decreased by $34 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, or 2%, primarily due to LCD glass price declines in the high single digits in percentage terms, partially offset by an increase in volume during the first quarter of 2018. The second quarter pricing environment was the most favorable in more than a decade.  

 ﻿  

 Net income in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $34 million and $94 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. Increased manufacturing costs of $33 million and $45 million, respectively, driven by the impact of the start-up of our facility in Hefei, China were the primary driver of the decrease for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. Additionally, for the six months ended June 30, 2018, the glass price declines described above contributed to the decrease and were partially offset by increases in volume.   

 ﻿  


 In the third quarter, we expect the LCD glass market volume to grow mid-single digits sequentially, and for our volume to grow faster than the market. We expect third quarter sequential LCD price declines to again be moderate.

 Optical Communications  


 ﻿  

 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased by $141 million, or 16%, and $209 million, or 12%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. Higher sales of carrier products, up $96 million and $145 million, and enterprise network products, up $45 million and $64 million, respectively, drove the increase. Strong growth in the North American and European fiber-to-the-home and access markets drove the increase in carrier network products, and an increase in data centers drove the increase in enterprise network sales.  

 ﻿  

 Net income increased by $22 million, or 17%, and $21 million, or 9%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase was driven by the change in sales outlined above. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, volume gains were partially offset by costs associated with our planned capacity expansions.

 On June 1, 2018, Corning acquired substantially all of 3M’s Communications Market Division, results of which will be included in the Optical Communications segment. Net sales and net income had an insignificant impact on the results of this segment in the second quarter of 2018.  


 In the third quarter, Optical Communications sales are expected to increase by approximately 25% on a year-over-year basis, including the impact of the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division.

 Specialty Materials  


 ﻿  

 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 Net sales in the Specialty Materials segment increased by $6 million, or 2%, during the second quarter of 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018, decreased by $16 million, or 3%. Net income decreased by $6 million, or 9%, and $17 million, or 13% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily driven by development costs for new technology. Improvements in manufacturing efficiency partially offset the decline.  

 ﻿  


 In the third quarter of 2018, Specialty Materials sales are expected to increase approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis.

 Index  

Net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment increased $54 million, or 21%, and $101 million, or 19%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. Automotive product sales increased $30 million and $52 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, due to global market strength and continued sales growth of gas particulate filters. Diesel product sales increased $24 million and $49 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. The increases were driven by higher demand for heavy-duty diesel products in North America and Europe.  Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted net sales in the amounts of $12 million and $32 million when compared to the corresponding three and six-month periods in 2017.  

 ﻿  

 Net income increased by $16 million, or 42%, and $24 million, or 29%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. The increase was driven by the sales increase outlined above and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted net income in the amounts of $1 million and $5 million when compared to the corresponding three and six-month periods in 2017.  

 ﻿  


 In the third quarter, we expect sales to increase in the high-teens in percentage terms on a year-over-year basis.

 ﻿  

 Life Sciences  


 ﻿  

 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 Net sales in the Life Sciences segment increased by $24 million, or 11%, and $46 million, or 11%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, driven by higher sales in North America, Europe and China. Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted net sales in the amount of $5 million and $14 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.  

 ﻿  

 Net income increased by $9 million, or 41%, and $12 million, or 26%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, driven by the increase in sales described above and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact net income in the three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same periods in 2017.  

 ﻿  


 Third-quarter sales are expected to increase by a mid-single digit percentage on a year-over-year basis.   

 ﻿  

 All Other  

 All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.” This group is primarily comprised of the results of the pharmaceutical technologies business and new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates.   

 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 Net sales of this segment increased by $4 million, or 9%, and $18 million, 22%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, when compared to the same period in 2017, driven by an increase in sales in our emerging businesses. The increase in the net loss of $16 million, or 26%, and $30 million, or 25%, reflects higher spending in our development projects when compared to the corresponding three and six month periods ending June 30, 2017.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  

 ﻿  

 Financing and Capital Resources  


 ﻿  


 In the second quarter of 2018, Corning issued ¥65.5 billion Japanese yen-denominated debt securities in tranches of 7, 10 and 12 years. The proceeds from these notes were received in Japanese yen and immediately converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance. The net proceeds received in U.S. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, was $596 million. Payments of principal and interest on the notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a U.S. dollar equivalent.   

 ﻿  


 There were no significant items that impacted Corning’s financing structure in the six months ended June 30, 2017.  

 ﻿  

 Common Stock Dividends  

 On April 26, 2018, Corning’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share of common stock to be paid on June 29, 2018 to all shareholders of record as of May 31, 2018.   

 ﻿  

 Share Repurchase Program  

 During 2017, Corning repurchased 84.4 million shares for approximately $2.4 billion through accelerated share repurchase agreements and open market repurchases under the 2016 Repurchase Program.  

 ﻿  

 In the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 24.6 million and 51.6 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $674 million and $1,488 million, respectively, as part of its 2016 Repurchase Program.   

 ﻿  

 Refer to Note 14 (Shareholders’ Equity) for additional information.  

 ﻿  

 Capital Spending  

 Capital spending totaled $1,177 million and $761 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect our 2018 capital expenditures to be slightly more than $2.0 billion, driven by expansions related to the Gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facility, the addition of capacity to support the new gas-particulate filters business in the Environmental Technologies segment and investment to support growth in customer demand in the Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments.  

 ﻿  

 Cash Flow   


 ﻿  


 ﻿  

 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $564 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period last year, driven by customer deposits received of $576 million and the positive impact of changes in working capital of $215 million. A $62 million decline in dividends received from affiliated companies and non-cash adjustments partially offset these cash inflows.  

 ﻿  

 Net cash used in investing activities increased by $1,121 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period last year, driven by the cash outflow of $794 million for the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, an increase of $416 million in capital expenditures largely due to capacity expansion projects in our Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Environmental Technologies segments and a decrease of $113 million in realized gains on translated earnings contracts. Cash received of $196 million, which represents the original fair value of the contingent consideration asset related to the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials (see Note 13), partially offset the net cash used in investing activities.  

 ﻿  

 Net cash used in financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased by $440 million when compared to the same period last year, driven by an increase of $438 million in share repurchases, debt repayments of $375 million and a decrease of $209 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $596 million partially offset the negative cash impact of these items.

 Management Assessment of Liquidity  

 We ended the first half of 2018 with approximately $2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world, with approximately 70% held outside of the United States, and are generally unrestricted. We utilize a variety of financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. In the first half of 2018, the Company distributed approximately $2.2 billion from its foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent of those subsidiaries. There were no incremental taxes beyond the toll charge due with the respect to this distribution of cash.   

 ﻿  

 To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements. We are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of $850 million of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt. Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate.   

 ﻿  

 Corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $2 billion. Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company’s $2 billion revolving credit facility is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper.  

 ﻿  

 Other   

 We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues. We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.  

 ﻿  

 Our major source of funding for 2018 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.

Corning has access to a $2 billion unsecured committed revolving credit facility. This credit facility includes a leverage ratio financial covenant. The required leverage ratio, which measures debt to total capital, is a maximum of 50%. At June 30, 2018, our leverage using this measure was approximately 28%, and, as such, are in compliance with the financial covenant.  

 ﻿  

 Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default in excess of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument. As of June 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all such provisions.  

 ﻿  

 Management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity. In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  

 ﻿  

 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates that require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described in our 2017 Form 10-K and remain unchanged through the first six months of 2018. For certain items, additional details are provided below.  

 ﻿  

 Impairment of Assets Held for Use  

 We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. We review our long-lived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.  

 ﻿  

 Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium. These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process and have a very long useful life. Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets. This review considers all of the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity. Precious metals are only acquired to support our manufacturing operations and are not held for trading or other purposes.  

 ﻿  

 At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $663 million and $711 million, respectively. These precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments. Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments. The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments. Such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our Display Technologies or Specialty Materials segments.

ENVIRONMENT  

 ﻿  

 Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (“the Agency”) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Corning had accrued approximately $35 and $38 million, respectively, (undiscounted) for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.  

 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

 ﻿  

 The statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on Forms 8-K, and related comments by management that are not historical facts or information and contain words such as “will,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “see,” “would,” and “target” and similar expressions are forward-looking statements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

 ﻿  

 Market Risk Disclosures  

 ﻿  

 As noted in our 2017 Form 10-K, we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and other currencies. Volatility in the global financial markets could increase the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates which would, in turn, impact our sales and net income. For a discussion of our exposure to market risk and how we mitigate that risk, refer to Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks, contained in our 2017 Form 10-K.  

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

 ﻿  

 Under the supervision of and with the participation of Corning’s management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), as of June 30, 2018, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, we have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. Corning’s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Corning in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Corning’s management, including Corning’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or other persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   

 ﻿  

 An evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting was also performed to determine whether any changes have occurred during the period covered by this Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that there was no change in Corning’s internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
