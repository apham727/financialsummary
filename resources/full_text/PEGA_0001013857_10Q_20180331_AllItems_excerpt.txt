NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

Pegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.) for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

On January 1, 2018 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) using the full retrospective method which required each prior reporting period presented to be adjusted to reflect the application of this ASU. See Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements for additional information.  

In the opinion of management, the Company has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on the same basis as its audited financial statements, and these financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented.  

The operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year 2018.  

2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

Financial Instruments  

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model for credit losses. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of other-than-temporary impairments. The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  

Leases  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets, recognizing a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects that most of its operating lease commitments will be subject to this ASU and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption with no material impact to its results of operations and cash flows.  

ASC 606 and ASC 340-40  

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The Company adopted ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 on January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective method, which required the Company to retrospectively adjust the prior periods presented.  


      Perpetual licenses with extended payment terms and term licenses - Revenue from perpetual license with extended payment terms and term license is now recognized when control is transferred to the client, the point in time when the client can use and benefit from the license. Previously the Company recognized revenue over the term of the agreements as payments became due or earlier if prepaid. Any unrecognized license revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period that control transfers, as either a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of December 31, 2015 or as revenue in periods thereafter. Unbilled receivables in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets increased significantly due to the revenue from perpetual license with extended payment terms and term license being recognized prior to amounts billed, or prepaid by, clients.  

      Allocation of future credits and significant discounts - The perpetual or term licenses delivered are a separate performance obligation which now requires us to allocate any future credits and discounts to the performance obligations in the arrangement based upon their relative stand-alone selling prices.

PEGASYSTEMS INC.  

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  

      Deferred contract costs - Sales incentive programs and other incremental and recoverable costs to obtain a contract were previously expensed when incurred. ASC 340-40 requires these costs to be recognized as an asset when incurred and to be expensed over the period of expected benefit, which is on average five years. This change primarily impacts the Companys contracts related to multi-year cloud offerings, maintenance on term and perpetual licenses, and those long-term term and perpetual licenses with client usage rights that increase over time.  

      Taxes - The corresponding effect on tax balances in relation to all of the above impacts has also been recognized.  

For additional information on the Companys accounting policies as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 see Note 4. Receivables, Contract Assets, and Deferred Revenue, Note 5. Deferred Contract Costs, and Note 9. Revenue.  



   (1)  Includes cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, income taxes receivable, other current assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-term assets (as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017).

PEGASYSTEMS INC.  

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  

As of March 31, 2018, the Company did not hold any investments with unrealized losses that are considered to be other-than-temporary.  

As of March 31, 2018, remaining maturities of marketable securities ranged from May 2018 to February 2021, with a weighted-average remaining maturity of approximately 1.4 years.  

4. RECEIVABLES, CONTRACT ASSETS, AND DEFERRED REVENUE  

Receivables  


Unbilled receivables is the amount due from clients where the only condition on the right of payment is the passage of time. The Company regularly reassesses receivables for collectability. As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the allowance for doubtful accounts was not material.  



Contract assets and deferred revenue  


 (1) Included in other current assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

 (2) Included in other long-term liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.  

Contract assets and deferred revenue are presented net at the contract level for each reporting period. Contract assets are unbilled amounts resulting from client contracts where revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation. Deferred revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition.  

The change in deferred revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018, excluding the impact of the netting of contract assets and deferred revenue, was primarily due to new billings in advance of revenue recognition and $101.6 million of revenue recognized that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2017.  

Major clients  

No client represented 10% or more of the Companys total receivables as of March 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017.  

5. DEFERRED CONTRACT COSTS  

Sales incentives paid by the Company are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a client. These costs are deferred, as a long-term asset, and then amortized using the straight-line method over the period of benefit which is on average five years. The Company determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration client contracts, the Companys technology, and other factors. The Company utilizes a practical expedient available under ASC 606 to expense costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the original

amortization period is one year or less. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, impairment of deferred contract costs was not material.  


 (1) Included in selling and marketing expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.

8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  

The Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and investments in privately-held companies at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  


      Level 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  

      Level 2 - significant other inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; and  

      Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs on which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions. This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.  

The Companys cash equivalents are composed of money market funds and time deposits which are classified as Level 1 and Level 2, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy. The Companys marketable securities, which are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on a market approach using quoted prices, when available, or matrix pricing compiled by third party pricing vendors, using observable market inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, and credit risk. The Companys investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are valued using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.  

If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs. There were no transfers between levels during the three months ended March 31, 2018.  


Table of Contents 

PEGASYSTEMS INC.  

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  



For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying value approximates their fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these items.  

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis  

Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including property and equipment and intangible assets, are recognized at fair value when they are impaired. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not recognize any impairments of its assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  


Revenue policy  

The Companys revenue is derived from sales of software licenses, maintenance fees related to the Companys software licenses, and services.  

      License revenue is primarily derived from sales of the Companys software applications and Pega Platform.  

      Maintenance revenue includes revenue from client support including software upgrades, on a when and-if available basis, telephone support, and bug fixes or patches.  

      Cloud revenue is derived from sales of the Companys hosted Pega Platform and software application environments.  

      Consulting revenue is primarily related to new license implementations.  

Contracts with multiple performance obligations  

The Companys license and cloud arrangements often contain multiple performance obligations, including maintenance, consulting, and training. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. If the transaction price contains discounts or expects to provide a future price concession, these elements are considered when determining the transaction price prior to allocation. Variable fees within the transaction price will be estimated and recognized in revenue as the Company satisfies its performance obligations to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable fee is resolved. If the contract grants the client the option to acquire additional products or services, the Company assesses whether or not any discount on the products and services is in excess of levels normally available to similar clients and, if so, accounts for that discount as an additional performance obligation.

PEGASYSTEMS INC.  

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  

Software licenses  

The Company has concluded that its software licenses are distinct performance obligations as the client can benefit from the software on its own. Software license revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the client, which is defined as the point in time when the client can use and benefit from the license. The software license is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without services, updates, and technical support. The Companys license arrangements generally contain multiple performance obligations, including consulting, training, and maintenance. Stand-alone selling price for software licenses is determined using the residual approach. The Company utilizes the residual approach as license performance obligations are sold for a broad range of amounts (the selling price is highly variable) and a stand-alone selling price is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. Periodically, the Company evaluates whether the residual approach is appropriate for its license and cloud performance obligations when sold with other performance obligations. As a result, if the stand­alone selling price analysis illustrates that the license and cloud performance obligations are no longer highly variable, the Company will utilize the relative allocation method for such arrangements.  

Term license fees are usually payable in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the license agreement, which is typically three to five years and may be renewed for additional terms at the clients option. Perpetual license fees are usually payable when the contract is executed. The Company recognizes software license revenue when control is transferred, and the corresponding difference between the amount invoiced and recognized as revenue is recorded as unbilled receivables, as the payment of consideration is subject only to the passage of time.  

Maintenance  

Maintenance revenue includes revenue from client support and related professional services. Client support includes software upgrades on a when and-if available basis, telephone support, and bug fixes or patches. Maintenance is priced as a percentage of the selling price of the related software license, which is highly variable. The Company determined the standalone selling price of maintenance based on this pricing relationship, which has remained constant within a narrow range, and observable data from standalone sales of maintenance, along with all other observable data.  


   1. software upgrades and updates; and  


These performance obligations are distinct within the contract and, although they are not sold separately, the components are not essential to the functionality of the other components. Each of the performance obligations included in maintenance revenue is a stand-alone obligation that is recognized over the passage of the contractual term, which is typically one year. Maintenance fees are usually payable in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the agreement.  

Services  

The Companys services revenue is comprised of consulting and training, including software license implementations, training, reimbursable expenses, and cloud which is derived from sales of the Companys hosted Pega Platform and software application environments. The Company has concluded that most services are distinct performance obligations. Consulting may be provided on a stand-alone basis or bundled with license and software maintenance services.  

The stand-alone selling price for consulting in time and materials contracts is determined by observable prices in similar transactions without multiple performance obligations and recognized as revenue as the services are performed. Fees for time and materials consulting contracts are usually payable shortly after the service is provided.  

The Company estimates the stand-alone selling price for fixed price services based on the estimated hours versus actual hours in similar geographies and for similar contract sizes. Revenue for fixed price services is recognized over time as the services are provided. Fees for fixed price services consulting contracts are usually payable as contract milestones are achieved.  

The stand-alone selling price of cloud sales of production environments is determined based on the residual approach when sold with services and is recognized over the term of the service. The Company utilizes the residual approach as cloud performance obligations are sold for a broad range of amounts (the selling price is highly variable) and a stand-alone selling price is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. The stand-alone selling price for cloud sales of development and testing environments is developed using observable prices in similar transactions without multiple performance obligations and is recognized over time over the term of the service. Cloud fees are usually payable in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis over the term of the service.

Geographic revenue  


Major products and services  


During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no material changes in the Companys estimate of variable fees. The amount of revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was not material.  

Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations  

Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. Transaction price on remaining performance obligations was $291 million as of March 31, 2018, of which the Company expects to recognize $198.3 million prior to January 1, 2020. These amounts do not include contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less. For reporting periods ending prior to January 1, 2018, the date of initial adoption of ASC 606, the Company has elected the practical expedient and not compiled and disclosed the amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations.

Expense  


The Company recognizes stock-based compensation on the accelerated recognition method, treating each vesting tranche as if it were an individual grant. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had, net of estimated forfeitures, $92.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, related to all unvested restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options, which was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.  

Grants  



 (1)  Includes approximately 0.1 million RSUs which were granted in connection with the election by certain employees to receive 50% of their 2018 target incentive compensation under the Companys Corporate Incentive Compensation Plan in the form of RSUs instead of cash. Stock-based compensation of approximately $8.2 million associated with this RSU grant is expected to be recognized over a one-year period beginning on the grant date.  

RSU vestings and stock option exercises  

During the three months ended March 31, 2018, 0.6 million shares of common stock were issued due to stock option exercises and RSU vestings under the Companys stock-based compensation plans.

Effective Tax Rate  





      a decrease in the estimated annual effective income tax rate primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. statutory federal tax rate from 35% to 21% pursuant to the Tax Reform Act; and  

      an increase in U.S. research and development tax credits.  

Tax Reform Act  

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act) was enacted into law, which significantly changed U.S. tax law and included many provisions such as a reduction of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, imposed a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign earnings, and included a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of foreign subsidiaries, a special tax deduction for foreign derived intangible income, and a base erosion anti-abuse tax measure (BEAT) that may tax payments between a U.S. corporation and its foreign subsidiaries, among other tax changes.  

Under the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), the Company recognized the provisional tax impacts in the three months ended December 31, 2017 that included $20.4 million of income tax expense to re-measure its net deferred tax assets to the 21% enacted rate. However, the Company has revised its provisional amount to reflect the impact of the retrospective adoption of ASC 606 and has recognized a $12.6 million income tax benefit for the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities on a retrospective basis in the three months ended December 31, 2017.  

The final amounts may differ from those provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Reform Act.  

The Tax Reform Act also provided for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through December 31, 2017. However, based on the Companys provisional analysis performed as of that date, the Company does not expect to be subject to the one-time transition tax due to the Companys foreign subsidiaries being in a net accumulated deficit position. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recognized no significant adjustments to these estimates.  


      The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax base foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiarys tangible assets. The Company expects that it will be subject to incremental U.S. tax resulting from GILTI inclusions beginning in 2018. As of March 31, 2018, the Company has included an estimate of the effect of its GILTI provisions in its estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company continues to monitor IRS guidance and will update its estimates as guidance is issued.  

      The BEAT provisions in the Tax Reform Act impose an alternative minimum tax on taxpayers with substantial base-erosion payments. The Companys preliminary assessment is that the Company will not be subject to the BEAT in 2018. The Company continues to monitor IRS guidance and will update its estimates as guidance is issued.

12. EARNINGS PER SHARE  

Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and RSUs, using the treasury stock method. In periods of loss, all stock options and RSUs are excluded, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.  



 (1)  Certain outstanding stock options and RSUs were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive in the period presented. These awards may be dilutive in the future.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains or incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our future financial performance and business plans, the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources, the continued payment of quarterly dividends, and the timing of revenue recognition and are described more completely in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate, and managements beliefs and assumptions. In addition, other written or oral statements that constitute forward-looking statements may be made by us or on our behalf. Words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, could, estimate, may, target, strategy, is intended to, project, guidance, likely, usually, or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.  

These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Important factors that could cause actual future activities and results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements include, among others, variation in demand for our products and services and the difficulty in predicting factors affecting the timing of license revenue recognition; reliance on third party relationships; our beliefs and the timing of the completion of our analysis regarding the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, including its impact on income tax expense and deferred tax assets; the inherent risks associated with international operations and the continued uncertainties in the global economy; our continued effort to market and sell both domestically and internationally; foreign currency exchange rates; the financial impact of any future acquisitions; the potential legal and financial liabilities and reputation damage due to cyber-attacks and security breaches; and management of our growth. These risks, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements, are described more completely in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as other filings we make with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

BUSINESS OVERVIEW  

We develop, market, license, and support software applications for customer engagement and digital process automation, in addition to licensing our Pega Platform application development product for clients that wish to build and extend their own applications. The Pega Platform and applications help connect enterprises to their customers in real-time across channels, streamline business operations, and adapt to meet changing requirements.  

Our clients include Global 3000 companies and government agencies that seek to manage complex enterprise systems and customer service issues with greater agility and cost-effectiveness. Our strategy is to sell a client a series of licenses, each focused on a specific purpose or area of operations in support of longer term enterprise-wide digital transformation initiatives.  

Our license revenue is primarily derived from sales of our applications and Pega Platform. Our cloud revenue is derived from our hosted software application and Pega Platform environments. Our consulting revenue is primarily related to new license implementations.  


Table of Contents 

Financial and Performance Metrics  

We adopted the new revenue recognition standard (ASC 606) effective January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective method. See Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements included in Item 1. Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.   


The decrease in total revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to a large term license arrangement recognized in revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and a shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements. Cloud arrangements are generally recognized in revenue over the term of the cloud contract, as compared to other arrangements, which are generally recognized in revenue on the contract effective date.  

Annual Contract Value (ACV)(1)  

The change in ACV measures the growth and predictability of future cash flows from committed term, cloud, and maintenance arrangements as of the end of the particular reporting period.  



      The sum of the annual value of each term and cloud contract in effect on such date, with the annual value of a term or cloud contract being equal to the total value of the contract divided by the total number of years of the contract.  

      Maintenance revenue reported for the quarter ended on such date, multiplied by four.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICES  

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) and the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and expectations of what could occur in the future given available information.  

Revenue  

We account for revenue in accordance with ASC 606. Our revenue recognition policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates.  

Our clients contracts typically contain promises to transfer multiple products and services. Judgment is required to determine whether each product and service is considered to be a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately under the contract. We allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations based on relative stand-alone selling price. We estimate stand-alone selling price based on the prices charged to clients, or by using information such as market conditions and other observable inputs. However, the selling price of our software licenses and cloud performance obligations are highly variable. Thus, we estimate stand-alone selling price for software licenses and cloud performance obligations using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price minus the stand-alone selling price of other performance obligations promised in the contract.  

In applying our revenue recognition policy, we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred and recognized in future periods. We analyze various factors including, but not limited to, the selling price of undelivered services when sold on a stand-alone basis, our pricing policies, and contractual terms and conditions in helping us to make such judgments about revenue recognition. Changes in judgment on any of these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a given period.  

Deferred Contract Costs  

Sales incentives paid by us are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a client. These costs are deferred and then amortized over the period of benefit, which is on average five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our client contracts, our technology, and other factors.  

Except as described above, there have been no changes in our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  



Table of Contents 

Revenue  

Software license  


The decrease in perpetual license revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in the value of perpetual arrangements executed in the three months ended March 31, 2018 driven primarily by a shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements.  

The decrease in term license revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to a large term license arrangement recognized in revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and a shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements.  

Maintenance  


The increase in maintenance revenue was primarily due to the continued growth in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software and strong renewal rates significantly in excess of 90%.  

Services  


The increase in cloud revenue was primarily due to the continued growth of our cloud client base driven by a shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements.  

The increase in consulting and training revenue was primarily due to higher billable hours during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Our consulting and training revenue may fluctuate in future periods depending on the mix of new implementation projects we perform as compared to those performed by our enabled clients or led by our partners.  

Gross profit  



Table of Contents 

The decrease in total gross profit in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to a large term license arrangement recognized in revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Additionally we have experienced a shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements, which are generally recognized in revenue over the term of the cloud contract, as compared to other arrangements, which are generally recognized in revenue on the contract effective date.  

The increase in maintenance gross profit percent in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was driven by a $0.5 million decrease in client support expenses as we transferred client support resources to support our growing cloud business.  

The increase in cloud gross profit percent in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was driven by cost efficiency gains as our cloud business continues to grow and scale, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in client support expenses as we expanded our cloud client support function to sustain our growing cloud business.  



Operating expenses  

Selling and marketing  


Selling and marketing expenses include compensation, benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with our selling and marketing personnel as well as advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Selling and marketing expenses also include the amortization of client-related intangibles.  

The increase in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of $11.6 million, driven by increased headcount and equity compensation, amortization of deferred commissions, increased spending on event marketing and digital advertising, and the expenses associated with assigning contract negotiation resources to drive efficiencies in the sales process in support of our long-term growth.  

The increase in headcount reflects our efforts to increase our sales capacity to target new accounts in existing industries, as well as to expand coverage in new industries and geographies, and to increase the number of sales opportunities.  

Research and development  


Research and development expenses include compensation, benefits, contracted services, and other headcount-related expenses associated with the creation and development of our products, as well as enhancements and design changes to existing products and the integration of acquired technologies.  

The increase in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of $4.6 million attributable to increased headcount, and the expansion of our application development team to support the continued development of our software.  


Table of Contents 

General and administrative  


General and administrative expenses include compensation, benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, corporate governance, and other administrative headcount. They also include accounting, legal, and other professional consulting and administrative fees. The general and administrative headcount includes employees in human resources, information technology, and corporate services departments, whose costs are partially allocated to other operating expense areas.  

The increase in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of $1.1 million, attributable to equity compensation, and an increase of $1 million in legal fees. The decrease in headcount reflects the realignment of contract negotiation and product development resources to augment our selling and marketing and research development functions, respectively.  

Stock-based compensation  


The increase was primarily due to the increased value of our annual periodic equity awards granted in March 2018 and 2017. These awards generally have a five-year vesting schedule.  








Table of Contents 




      a decrease in the estimated annual effective income tax rate primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. statutory federal tax rate from 35% to 21% pursuant to the Tax Reform Act; and  

      an increase in U.S. research and development tax credits.  

The inclusion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as a component of the provision for income taxes has increased the volatility of the effective tax rates in recent periods, and may continue to do so in future periods, as the amount of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation awards varies depending on our future stock price in relation to the fair value of awards, the timing of RSU vestings, exercise behavior of our stock option holders, and the total value of future grants of stock-based compensation awards.  

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  


We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations, quarterly cash dividends, and stock repurchases for at least the next 12 months.  

If it became necessary to repatriate foreign funds, we may be required to pay U.S. state and local taxes, as well as foreign taxes, upon repatriation. Due to the complexity of the income tax laws and the effects of the Tax Reform Act, it is impracticable to estimate the amount of taxes we would have to pay.  

Cash provided by operating activities  

The primary drivers during the three months ended March 31, 2018 were net income of $12.2 million and $49.6 million from receivables and contract assets, largely due to increased cash collections and the timing of billings.  

The primary driver during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was net income of $53.0 million.  

Cash used in investing activities  

During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we purchased investments of $35.2 million and made investments of $2.1 million in property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds received from maturities of investments (including called marketable debt securities) of $6 million.  

During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we purchased investments of $3.3 million, partially offset by proceeds received from maturities of investments (including called marketable debt securities) of $2.3 million. We also invested $2.4 million primarily for leasehold improvements for the build out of additional office space at our Hyderabad, India location.

Cash used in financing activities  

We used cash primarily for repurchases of our common stock under our publicly announced stock repurchase programs, stock repurchases for tax withholdings for the net settlement of our equity awards, and the payment of our quarterly dividend.  

Since 2004, our Board of Directors has approved annual stock repurchase programs that have authorized the repurchase in the aggregate of up to $195 million of our common stock. Purchases under these programs have been made on the open market. As of March 31, 2018, $159.2 million had been repurchased, $29.2 million remained available for repurchase, and $6.4 million had expired.  

Common stock repurchases  


   (1)  Represents activity under our publicly announced stock repurchase programs.  

   (2)  During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, instead of receiving cash from the equity holders, we withheld shares with a value of $11.2 million and $7.7 million for the exercise price of options. These amounts have been excluded from the table above.  

Dividends  


During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, we paid cash dividends of $2.3 million. It is our current intention to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share, however, the Board of Directors may terminate or modify this dividend program at any time without prior notice.  

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily related to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Other than the item discussed below, there were no significant changes to our market risk exposure during the first three months ended March 31, 2018.  

See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a more complete discussion of our market risk exposure.  

Foreign currency exposure  

Translation Risk  

Our international sales are usually denominated in foreign currencies. However, the operating expenses of our foreign operations are also primarily denominated in foreign currencies, which partially offset our foreign currency exposure.  




Table of Contents 


We have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our results of operations as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We are primarily exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with Australian dollar, Euro, and U.S. dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and intercompany receivables and payables held by our U.K. subsidiary, a British pound functional entity.  



    (1) The adoption of ASC 606 materially increased the unbilled receivables we have recorded, which has increased the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates reported in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.  

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  


Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) as of March 31, 2018. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applied its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2018.  


There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
