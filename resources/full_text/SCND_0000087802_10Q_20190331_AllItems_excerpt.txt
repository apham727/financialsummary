  1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

  Principles of Consolidation 

 The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Scientific Industries, Inc., Altamira Instruments, Inc. (“Altamira”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary, Scientific Bioprocessing, Inc. (“SBI”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary, and Scientific Packaging Industries, Inc., an inactive wholly-owned subsidiary (all collectively referred to as the “Company”). All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842). The FASB issued this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard. 


  Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 


 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”. This update provides guidance on how to record eight specific cash flow issues. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and a retrospective transition method to each period should be presented. The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 

 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)”, requiring that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective approach which requires application of the guidance for all periods presented. The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 


  Reclassification 

  Trade accounts receivable, current of $422,300 and $278,200, and trade accounts receivable, long term of $245,400 for the year ended June 30, 2018 were reclassified to contract assets, current; and contract assets, less current portion, respectively, on the balance sheet as of 

  March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018. Customer advances of $63,800 were reclassified to contract liabilities as of March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018. 


 The Company’s revenues are comprised of product sales (Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations) as well as products and related services such as installation and training as is customary for its customers of the Catalyst Research Instruments Operations. In addition, the Company’s Bioprocessing Systems Operations’ revenues are comprised of royalty revenues. All revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligation(s) under the contract (either implicit or explicit) by transferring the promised product or service to its customer either when (or as) its customer obtains control of the product or service. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. The majority of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promise to transfer products or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract and, therefore, not distinct. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using the Company’s best estimate of standalone selling price for each distinct product or service in the contract, which is generally based on an observable price. 

 Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products or providing services. As such, revenue is recorded net of returns, allowances, customer discounts, and incentives. Revenue from the Bioprocessing Systems Operations are recognized over time based on Management’s judgment and estimates. 


  3. Segment Information and Concentrations 





 Approximately 41% and 53% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (23% and 39% of total revenues) for the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories. 

 Approximately 30% and 21% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (17% and 16% of total revenues) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

 For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, three customers accounted for approximately 22% and 26% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (12% and 19% of the Company’s total revenues, respectively). 

 Sales of catalyst research instruments generally comprise a few very large orders averaging approximately $50,000 per order to a limited number of customers, who differ from order to order. Sales to five and two customers during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, accounted for approximately 86% and 89% of the Catalyst Research Instrument Operations’ revenues and 14% and 5% of the Company’s total revenues, respectively. 




 Approximately 47% and 51% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (34% and 43% of total revenues) for both the nine month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories. 

 Approximately 27% and 22% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (19% of total revenues for both periods) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for both the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, three customers accounted for approximately 22% and 15% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (16% and 12% of the Company’s total revenues), respectively. 

 Sales of catalyst research instruments generally comprise a few very large orders averaging approximately $50,000 per order to a limited number of customers, who differ from order to order. Sales to eight and three customers during the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, accounted for approximately 88% and 79% of the Catalyst Research Instrument Operations’ revenues and 12% and 4% of the Company’s total revenues, respectively. 


  4. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. 


 Level 1 - Inputs that are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 

 Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 

 Level 3 - Prices or valuation that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

 In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company calculated the fair value of its Level 1 and 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments. These calculations take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and its counterparties. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. 

 The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria. The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the following tables. 











 Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value, and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. The estimate is based on management's review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. Cost of work-in-process and finished goods inventories include material, labor, and manufacturing overhead. 



 6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with the Company’s acquisitions. Goodwill amounted to $705,300 at March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 




 Total amortization expense was $47,900 and $61,200 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively and $170,200 and $183,400 for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of March 31, 2019, estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets is $16,600 for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, $66,400 for fiscal 2020, $49,100 for fiscal 2021, $26,100 for fiscal 2022, $9,800 for fiscal 2023, and $21,800 thereafter. 


  7. Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share 



 Approximately 1,750 and 82,000 shares of the Company's common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, because the effect would be anti-dilutive. 


  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

  Forward-Looking statements. Certain statements contained in this report are not based on historical facts, but are forward-looking statements that are based upon various assumptions about future conditions. Actual events in the future could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking information. Numerous unknown factors and future events could cause such differences, including but not limited to, product demand, market acceptance, success of marketing strategy, success of expansion efforts, impact of competition, adverse economic conditions, and other factors affecting the Company’s business that are beyond the Company’s control, which are discussed elsewhere in this report. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. 

  Overview. 

 The Company reflected income before income tax expense of $193,500 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to a loss before income tax benefit of $83,900 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in earned royalties by the Bioprocessing Systems Operations and reduced losses by the Catalyst Research Instruments Operations. The Company reflected income before income tax of $519,900 for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 compared to a loss before income tax benefit of $374,100 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 due to increases in revenues and profits across all business segments as described further under “Results of Operations”. The results reflected total non-cash amounts for depreciation and amortization and contingent consideration liability adjustments of $633,300 and $785,200 for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2019 compared to $521,700 and $675,800 for the corresponding three and nine month periods in 2018. 

  Results of Operations. 

  The Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 Compared with The Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 

 Net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased $954,200 (45.5%) to $3,053,500 from $2,099,300 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, reflecting increased earned bioprocessing royalties of $374,600, increased sales of catalyst research instruments of $397,900, and increased sales of benchtop laboratory equipment of $181,700. The benchtop laboratory equipment sales reflected $522,400 of Torbal brand product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $328,800 in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Bioprocessing Systems Operations benefitted from increased royalties, primarily in Europe, and the Catalyst Research Instruments benefitted from increased sales of custom products. As of March 31, 2019, the order backlog for catalyst research instruments was $834,300, substantially all of which is expected to ship during fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, compared to $1,175,800 as of March 31, 2018. 

 The overall gross profit percentage for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was 35.4% compared to 36.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2018. 

 General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased by $22,200 (4.7%) to $492,400 compared to $470,200 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to increased routine legal expenses and fees paid to directors for Board of Directors meetings as compared to the same period last year. 

 Selling expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased $18,300 (6.9%) to $282,100 from $263,800 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, due principally to sales commissions paid for catalyst research instruments sales. 

 Research and development expenses amounted to $120,900 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $117,700 for the three months ended March 31, 2018. 

 Total other income, net was $7,800 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 due to gains on redemptions of investment securities. 

 The Company reflected income tax expense of $99,900 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to income tax benefit of $46,200 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily resulting from the income for the current period. 

 As a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded net income of $93,600 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to a net loss of ($37,700) for the three months ended March 31, 2018. 


  The Nine Months Ended March 31, 2019 Compared with The Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018 

 Net revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 increased $1,982,700 (37.6%) to $7,255,300 from $5,272,600 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, reflecting an increase of $791,200 in net sales of benchtop laboratory equipment resulting from increased orders for Genie and Torbal brand products, an increase of $660,200 in net sales of catalyst research instruments derived from sales of custom products, and an increase of $531,300 in bioprocessing earned royalties. The benchtop laboratory equipment sales reflected $1,406,400 of Torbal brand product sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2019, compared to $993,000 in the nine months ended March 31, 2018. 

 The overall gross profit percentage for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 was 41.4% compared to 37.7% for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 mainly as a result of the higher sales and improved gross margins by the Catalyst Research Instruments Operations and increased royalties earned by the Bioprocessing Systems Operations.

 General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 increased $64,400 (4.9%) to $1,371,000 from $1,306,600 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, mainly due to various increases in administrative expenses by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations, including routine legal expenses and fees paid to the directors for 

 Board of Directors meetings compared to the same period last year. 

 Selling expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 increased $86,900 (12.8%) to $766,400 from $679,500 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, due to increased online advertising for the Torbal product line and sales commissions related to the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations. 

 Research and development expenses decreased by $32,100 (8.5%) to $347,600 for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $379,700 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to decreased new product development activities by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations related to the Torbal Scales Division’s new automated pill counter anticipated to be launched in autumn of 2019. 

 Total other income was $2,300 for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $6,400 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 primarily due to lower income on investment securities. 

 The Company reflected income tax expense of $165,800 for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 compared to an income tax benefit of $22,600 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to the income during the period. 

 As a result of the foregoing, the Company recorded net income of $354,100 for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 compared to a net loss of ($351,500) for the nine months ended March 31, 2018. 

  Liquidity and Capital Resources. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $301,100 to $1,354,200 as of March 31, 2019 from $1,053,100 as of June 30, 2018 primarily due to income during the period. 

  Net cash provided by operating activities was $484,700 for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $150,200 used during the nine months ended March 31, 2018. The current period reflected higher income, and decreased change in the use of cash for inventories and accounts payable compared to the last period, partially offset by change in accounts receivable balances. Net cash used in investing activities was $153,800 for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $88,600 used during the nine months ended March 31, 2018 primarily due to increased capital equipment purchases during the current period by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations. The Company used $29,800 in financing activities in the nine months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $107,700 in the nine months ended March 31, 2018 mainly due to contingent consideration payments of $142,700 in the prior year. 

  The Company's working capital increased by $873,500 to $4,991,700 as of March 31, 2019 compared to $4,118,200, as of June 30, 2018 primarily due to the income during the period. 

  The Company has a Demand Line of Credit through December 2019 with First National Bank of Pennsylvania which provides for borrowings of up to $300,000 for regular working capital needs, bearing interest at prime, currently 5.50%. Advances on the line, are secured by a pledge of the Company’s assets including inventory, accounts, chattel paper, equipment and general intangibles. As of March 31, 2019, $50,000 was outstanding under the line which was repaid in April 2019. 

  Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its cash flow needs during the 12 months ending March 31, 2020 from its available financial resources including the lines of credit, its cash and investment securities, and operations. 


  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's management performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of the Company has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2019, because of the identification of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting which related to the accounting for the fair market value of a contingent consideration liability related to its Bioprocessing Systems Operations. Notwithstanding the material weakness that existed as of March 31, 2019, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of the Company has concluded that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
