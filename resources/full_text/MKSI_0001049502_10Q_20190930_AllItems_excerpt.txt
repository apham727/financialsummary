Basis of Presentation   

The terms “MKS” and the “Company” refer to MKS Instruments, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The interim financial data as of September 30, 2019, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 are unaudited; however, in the opinion of MKS, the interim data includes all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. The condensed consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2018 has been derived from the consolidated audited financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 

10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the MKS Annual Report on Form 

10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2019.  

The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an 

on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, inventory, intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets, warranty liabilities, pension liabilities, acquisition expenses, income taxes and investments. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In October 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 

2018-16,  “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815).” This standard permits the use of the Overnight Index Swap Rate (“OIS”) based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815 in addition to the interest rates on direct treasury obligations of the U.S. government, the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) swap rate, the OIS rate based on the Federal Funds Effective Rate and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Rate. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this ASU during the first quarter of 2019 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 


Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 


internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an 

internal-use software license). The accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments to this update. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of this ASU and 

the impact of pending adoption on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 

2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815).” This standard better aligns an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this ASU during the first quarter of 2019 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 

2016-02, “Leases”. This standard requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for all leases, with certain exceptions, on the balance sheet. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 

2016-02 on January 1, 2019, and used the effective date as its date of initial application. As such, the Company did not adjust prior period amounts. The Company also elected to adopt the package of practical expedients upon transition, which permits companies to not reassess lease identification, classification, and initial direct costs for leases that commenced prior to the effective date.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  


The Company implemented internal controls and a lease accounting information system to enable preparation on adoption. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of initially applying this new standard, resulting in the addition of $71,042 of 

right-of-use assets and $20,192 and $54,147 of short-term and long-term lease liabilities, respectively. The 

right-of-use asset is net of the deferred rent liability, prepaid rent and a net favorable lease asset which were 

re-classified to the 

right-of-use asset upon adoption of the standard. For additional information on the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this standard, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.

adoption on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.   


Leases   

The Company has various operating leases for real estate and 

non-real estate items. The 

non-real estate leases are mainly comprised of automobiles but also include copiers, printers and other lower-valued items. The Company does not have any finance leases. 

The Company has lease arrangements with lease and 

non-lease components, has elected to account for the lease and 

non-lease  components as a single lease component, and has allocated all of the contract consideration to the lease component only. The Company has existing net leases in which the 

non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance, maintenance, consumables, etc.) are paid separately from rent based on actual costs incurred. Therefore, 

non-lease components are not included in the 

right-of-use asset and lease liability and are reflected as expenses in the periods incurred. 

The Company has existing leases that include variable lease and 

non-lease components that are not included in the 

right-of-use  asset and lease liability, and are reflected as expenses in the periods incurred. Such payments primarily include common area maintenance charges and increases in rent payments that are driven by factors such as future changes in an index (e.g., the Consumer Price Index). 

A 

right-of-use asset of $67,632, short-term lease liability of $20,575 and long-term lease liability of $47,294 were reflected on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2019.

The tables above, which show the gross unrealized gains and (losses) aggregated by investment category for 

available-for-sale  investments as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, reflect the inclusion within short-term investments of investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of purchase. Management has the ability, if necessary, to liquidate any of its investments in order to meet the Company’s liquidity needs in the next 12 months. Accordingly, those investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of purchase are classified as short-term on the accompanying balance sheets.

The Company reviews and evaluates its investments for any indication of possible impairment. Based on this review, the Company has determined that the unrealized losses related to these investments at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were temporary.

Interest income is accrued as earned. Dividend income is recognized as income on the date the ​​​​​​​stock trades 

“ex-dividend.” The cost of marketable securities sold is determined by the specific identification method. Realized gains or losses are reflected in income and were not material for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.


Fair Value Measurements 

In accordance with the provisions of fair value accounting, a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability and defines fair value based upon an exit price model

. 



Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities assessed as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  


Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments or securities or derivative contracts that are valued using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.  


Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 

In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the Company categorizes such assets and liabilities based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

Money Market Funds 

Money market funds are cash and cash equivalents and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  

Available-For-Sale Investments 

Available-for-sale investments consisted of time deposits, certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptance drafts, asset-backed securities (which include auto loans, credit card receivables and equipment trust receivables), commercial paper, corporate obligations, U.S. treasury obligations, U.S. agency obligations and group insurance contracts. 

The Company measures its debt and equity investments at fair value. The Company’s 

available-for-sale investments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Israeli Pension Assets 

Israeli pension assets represent investments in mutual funds, government securities and other time deposits. These investments are set aside for the retirement benefit of the employees at the Company’s Israeli subsidiaries. These funds are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  

Cost Method Investments  

The Company has a 

non-controlling equity investment in a privately held company. The Company elected the measurement alternative for this investment without readily determinable fair values and for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence. This investment is accounted for under the cost method of accounting. Under the cost method of accounting, the 

non-marketable equity securities are carried at cost less any impairment, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, which is recorded within the statement of operations. The Company holds $4,400 without readily determinable fair values both at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. This investment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 

Derivatives  

As a result of the Company’s global operating activities, the Company is exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and variable interest rates, which may adversely affect its operating results and financial position. When deemed appropriate, the Company minimizes its risks from foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments. The principal market in which the Company executes its foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps is the institutional market in an 

over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency. The market participants usually are large commercial banks. The forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate hedge are valued using broker quotations or market transactions and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.   


Derivatives   

The Company enters into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments and those utilized as economic hedges. The Company operates internationally and, in the normal course of business, is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. The Company has used derivative instruments, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, to manage certain foreign currency exposure, and interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure.  

By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. The Company enters into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions, for which no collateral is required. The Company has policies to monitor the credit risk of these counterparties. While there can be no assurance, the Company does not anticipate any material 

non-performance by any of these counterparties. 

Interest Rate Swap Agreements 

On September 30, 2016,  

the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix the rate on approximately 

50% of its then-outstanding balance under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, as described further in Note 11. This hedge fixes the interest rate paid on the hedged debt at 

1.198% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 

1.75% as of September 30, 2019, through 


At September 30, 2019, the notional amount of this transaction was

MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.  

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  


On April 3, 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of March 31, 2023, to fix the rate on $300,000 of the then-outstanding balance of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, as described further in Note 11. The rate 

was fixed at 2.309% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 1.75% at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, the notional amount of this transaction was $300,000 and 

it had a fair value liability of $8,088.   

The interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”). To the extent that these arrangements are no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationships is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs.  

Foreign Exchange Contracts 

The Company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency-denominated intercompany sales of inventory, over a maximum period of eighteen months, using forward foreign exchange contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges related to Japanese, South Korean, British, Euro and Taiwanese currencies. To the extent these derivatives are effective in 

off-setting the variability of the hedged cash flows, and otherwise meet the hedge accounting criteria, changes in the derivatives’ fair value are not included in current earnings but are included in OCI in stockholders’ equity. These changes in fair value will subsequently be reclassified into earnings, as applicable, when the forecasted transaction occurs. To the extent that a previously designated hedging transaction is no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs. The cash flows resulting from forward exchange contracts are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows as part of cash flows from operating activities. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes

. 

As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with gross notional values of $142,789 and $159,394, respectively.

Acquisitions 

Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. 

On February 1, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (“ESI”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 29, 2018 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, EAS Equipment, Inc., formerly a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and ESI (the “ESI Merger”). At the effective time of the ESI Merger and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each share of ESI’s common stock that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger was converted into the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without interest and subject to deduction of any required withholding tax. 

The aggregate consideration was $1,032,671, which excludes related transaction fees and expenses, and 

non-cash consideration related to the exchange of share-based awards of $30,630, for a total purchase consideration of $1,063,301. The Company funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of the Company’s available cash on hand and the proceeds from the Company’s senior secured term loan facility described in Note 11.





Represents the vested but not issued portion of ESI share-based compensation awards as of the acquisition date of February 1, 2019.   

Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total estimated acquisition consideration is allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities of ESI based on their fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the acquisition consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. The Company expects that none of such goodwill and intangible assets will be deductible for tax purposes.

During the 

second quarter of

 2019, the Company recorded an increase in fair value of approximately $12,600 to property, plant and equipment, based upon the final valuation for land and three ESI facilities located in Portland, Oregon. The Company also recorded a reduction in fair value of approximately $9,800 to inventories relating to three product lines. These adjustments also resulted in an adjustment to intangible assets of $2,400 and goodwill of $1,300 and the related impact to the deferred tax line items. 

The fair value 

write-up of acquired finished goods inventory was $7,624, the amount of which will be expensed over the period during which the acquired inventory is sold. 

For the 

nine months ended 

September 30, 2019, the Company recorded $7,624 

of incremental cost of sales charges associated with the fair value 

write-up of inventory acquired in the ESI Merger.   

The fair value 

of acquired property, plant and equipment of $39,267

 will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable assets, excluding the fair value 

write-up

 in the value of land. Property, plant and equipment is valued at its 

value-in-use,

 unless there was a known plan to dispose of the asset.

The acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the economic use of the asset. 



While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to value the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date, its estimates and assumptions are subject to refinement. 

The net fair value of the acquired intangibles was determined using the income approach. In performing these valuations, the key underlying probability-adjusted assumptions of the discounted cash flows were projected revenues, gross margin expectations and operating cost estimates.

 Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Company’s results of operations. The finalization of the purchase accounting assessment will result in a change in the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and may have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill to reflect additional information received about facts and circumstances which existed at the date of acquisition. The Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed subsequent to the purchase price allocation period in the

MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. 

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


Company’s operating results in the period in which the adjustments are determined. The size and breadth of the ESI Merger will necessitate the use of this measurement period to adequately analyze and assess a number of the factors used in establishing the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and the related tax impacts of any changes made. Any potential adjustments made could be material in relation to the preliminary values presented above.

The Company believes the amount of goodwill relative to identifiable intangible assets relates to several factors, including broadening its position in key industrial end markets to complementary solutions, and leveraging component and systems expertise to provide robust solutions to meet customer evolving technology needs. 


Certain executives from ESI had severance provisions in their respective ESI employment agreements. The agreements included terms that were accounted for as dual-trigger arrangements. Through the Company’s acquisition accounting, the expense relating to these benefits was recognized in the combined entity’s financial statements. The Company recorded costs of $2,701 and $14,023 in acquisition and integration costs as compensation expense and stock-based compensation expense, respectively, for the nine months ended 

September 30, 2019 associated with these severance provisions. The restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights that were eligible for accelerated vesting if the executive exercised his or her rights but were not issued as of each reporting 

period-end, were excluded from the computation of basic earnings per share and included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for such reporting period.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets    

Goodwill  

The Company’s methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established and generally accepted valuation techniques. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed. The Company assigns assets acquired (including goodwill) and liabilities assumed to one or more reporting units as of the date of acquisition. Typically acquisitions relate to a single reporting unit and thus do not require the allocation of goodwill to multiple reporting units. If the products obtained in an acquisition are assigned to multiple reporting units, the goodwill is distributed to the respective reporting units as part of the purchase price allocation process.  

Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment. The Company regularly monitors current business conditions and other factors including, but not limited to, adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions and lower projections of profitability that may impact future operating results.  





During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded $471,727 of goodwill related to the ESI Merger.

The Wall Street Journal, (3) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00%, and (4) a floor of 1.75%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin; or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a LIBOR rate floor of 0.0%, plus an applicable margin. The Company has elected the interest rate as described in clause (b). The Credit Agreement provides that, unless an alternate rate of interest is agreed, all loans will be determined by reference to the 

base 

rate if the LIBOR rate cannot be ascertained, if regulators impose material restrictions on the authority of a lender to make LIBOR rate loans, or for other reasons. The 2016 Term Loan Facility was issued with original issue discount of 1.00% of the principal amount thereof. 

The Company subsequently entered into 

four separate repricing amendments to the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which decreased the applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings from 4.0% to 1.75%, with a LIBOR rate floor of 0.75%. As a consequence of the pricing of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility (defined below), the applicable margin for the 2016 Term Loan Facility was increased to 2.00% (from 1.75%) with respect to LIBOR borrowings and 1.00% (from 0.75%) with respect to base rate borrowings. 

On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of 

September 30, 2020, to fix the rate on $335,000 of the then-outstanding balance of the 2016 Term Loan Facility. The rate 

was fixed at 1.198% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 

1.75% at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, the notional amount of this transaction was $250,000 and 

it had a fair value asset of $1,180.     

The Company incurred $28,747 of deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method.

On February 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the ESI Merger, the Company entered into an amendment (“Amendment No. 5”) to the Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 5 provided an additional tranche 

B-5 term loan commitment in the 

original principal amount of $650,000 (the “2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility”), all of which was drawn down in connection with the closing of the ESI Merger. Pursuant to Amendment No. 5, the Company also effectuated certain amendments to the Credit Agreement which make certain of the negative covenants and other provisions less restrictive. Prior to the effectiveness of Amendment No. 6 (as defined below), the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility had a maturity date of February 1, 2026 and bore interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, a base rate or LIBOR rate (as described above) plus, in each case, an applicable margin equal to 1.25% with respect to base rate borrowings and 2.25% with respect to LIBOR borrowings. The 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility was issued with original issue discount of 1.00% of the principal amount thereof. 

On April 3, 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of March 31, 2023, to fix the rate on $300,000 of the then-outstanding balance of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility. The rate 

was fixed at 2.309% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 1.75% at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, the notional amount of this transaction was $300,000 and 

it had a fair value liability of $8,088.  

The Company incurred $11,362 of deferred finance fees and original issue discount fees related to the term loans under the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method. 

On September 27, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment (“Amendment No. 6”) to the Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 6 refinanced all existing loans outstanding under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility (“Existing Term Loans”) for a tranche 


 term loan commitment in the original principal amount of $896,839 (“2019 Term Loan Refinancing Facility”). Each lender of the Existing Term Loans who elected to participate in the 2019 Term Loan Refinancing Facility was deemed to have exchanged the aggregate outstanding principal amount of its Existing Term Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement for an equal aggregate principal amount of tranche


term loans under the 2019 Term Loan Refinancing Facility. On the effective date of Amendment No. 6 and immediately prior to the exchanges described above, the Company made a voluntary prepayment of $50,000, which was applied to 

the Existing Term Loans on a pro rata basis.

Commencing with the completion of the first fiscal quarter ending after the closing of the ABL Facility, the applicable margin for borrowings thereunder is subject to upward or downward adjustment each fiscal quarter, based on the average historical excess availability during the preceding quarter. 

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal under the ABL Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder equal to 0.25% per annum. The Company must also pay customary letter of credit fees and agency fees. 

The Company incurred $785 of costs in connection with the ABL Facility, which were capitalized and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of five years of the ABL Facility. As a result of a prior asset-based facility being terminated concurrently with our entry into the ABL Facility, the Company wrote off $216 of previously capitalized debt issuance costs.  

The ABL Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the ABL Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the ABL Facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. The Company has not borrowed against this ABL Facility to date.  

Lines of Credit and Short-Term Borrowing Arrangements 

One of the Company’s Japanese subsidiaries has lines of credit and short-term borrowing arrangements with two financial institutions, which arrangements generally expire and are renewed at three-month intervals. The lines of credit provided for aggregate borrowings as of September 30, 2019 of up to an equivalent of $21,308. One of the borrowing arrangements has an interest rate based on the Tokyo Interbank Offer Rate at the time of borrowing and the other has an interest rate based on the Japanese Short-Term Prime Lending Rate. There were no borrowings outstanding under these arrangements at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.  

The Company has various revolving lines of credit and a financing facility. These revolving lines of credit and financing facility have no expiration date and as of September 30, 2019, provided for aggregate borrowings of up to an equivalent of $11,581. These lines of credit have a base interest rate of 1.24% plus a Japanese Yen overnight LIBOR rate.

Product Warranties

The Company records the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue. While the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company’s warranty obligation is affected by shipment volume, product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, and supplier warranties on parts delivered to the Company. Should actual product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, or supplier warranties on parts differ from the Company’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.





Income Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were 14.4% and 20.4%, 

respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, and related income tax expense, were lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate due to the deduction for foreign derived intangible income, the geographic mix of income earned by the Company’s international subsidiaries being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate and the impact of various tax credits, offset by the tax effects of the global intangible 

low-taxed income inclusion along with the correction of an 

out-of-period  error with respect to deferred tax assets related to limitations on the deduction of executive compensation in the amount of $5,023. This correction, which was recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2019, but should have been recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2018, increased the Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019 by 9.8%, 7.5% and


, respectively. The error and subsequent 

adjus

tment were not material to prior or current interim and annual financial statements. 

The Company’s effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were 18.5% and 17.6%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, and related income tax expense, were lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate mainly due to the geographic mix of income earned by the Company’s international subsidiaries being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate, windfall benefits of stock compensation, and the deduction for foreign derived intangible income

, offset by the tax effects of the global intangible low

-taxed income inclusion and state income taxes.

As of September 30, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $41,170. At December 31, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $32,684. The net increase was primarily attributable to the addition of historical gross unrecognized tax benefits for ESI as a result of the ESI Merger during the quarter ended March 31, 2019. As of 


MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC. 

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 


September 30, 2019, if these benefits were recognized in a future period, the timing of which is not estimable, the net unrecognized tax benefit of $33,415, excluding interest and penalties, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company accrues interest expense, and if applicable, penalties, for any uncertain tax positions. Interest and penalties are classified as a component of income tax expense. As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $581 and $568, respectively.

Over the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that the Company may recognize approximately $1,225 of previously net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, related to various U.S. federal, state and foreign tax positions primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service commenced an examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax filings for tax years 2015 and 2016 during the quarter ended September 30, 2017. This audit was effectively settled during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and the impact was not material. Also during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 the Company received notification from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service of their intent to audit its U.S. subsidiary, Newport, for tax year 2015. This audit commenced during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and was effectively settled during the quarter ended June 30, 2019 with a no change result. The U.S. statute of limitations remains open for tax years 2016 through present. The statute of limitations for the Company’s tax filings in other jurisdictions varies between fiscal years 2013 through present. The Company also has certain federal credit carry-forwards and state tax loss and credit carry-forwards that are open to examination for tax years 2000 through the present.


Net Income Per Share


Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding (using the treasury stock method) if securities containing potentially dilutive common shares (restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock appreciation rights (“SARs”)) had been converted to such common shares, and if such assumed conversion is dilutive. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, there were approximately 


165,000 weighted-average RSUs, respectively, that would have had an anti-dilutive effect on EPS, and would thus need to be excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, there were approximately 


68,800 weighted-average RSUs, respectively, that would have had an anti-dilutive effect on EPS, and would thus need to be excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares.

SAR

s

 were converted automatically into 

SARs

 with respect to 12,787 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Assumed SARs”). 

Included in the total number of assumed RSUs are 326,283 shares of the Company’s common stock for employees and outside directors that are part of the ESI Deferred Compensation plan (the “ESI DC Plan”). These shares will not become issued shares until their respective release dates. 

The shares of the Company’s common stock that are subject to the Assumed SARs and the Assumed RSUs are issuable pursuant to the Company’s 2014 Plan. 

The 748,920 shares of the Company’s common stock that are issuable pursuant to the Assumed RSUs and the Assumed SARs under the Company’s 2014 Plan were registered under the Securities Act of 1933 on the Registration Statement on Form

During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company granted 417,335 RSUs with a weighted average grant date fair value of $86.18. During the nine months ended 

September

 30, 2018, the Company granted 260,341 RSUs with a weighted average grant date fair value of $112.49. There were no SARs granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 or 2018. 



At September 30, 2019, the total compensation expense related to unvested stock-based awards granted to employees and directors under the 2014 Plan that had not been recognized was $30,795, net of estimated forfeitures. The future compensation expense for time-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis and the future compensation expense for performance-based awards is recognized using the accelerated graded vesting method, both of which expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, except for retirement eligible employees, in which case the Company expenses the fair value of the grant in the period the grant is issued. The Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards and historical experience. Actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from the Company’s current estimates.

The timing and quantity of any shares repurchased will depend upon a variety of factors, including business conditions, stock market conditions and business development activities, including, but not limited to, merger and acquisition opportunities. These repurchases may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The Company has repurchased approximately 2,588,000 shares of common stock for approximately $127,000 pursuant to the program since its adoption.

Commitments and Contingencies   

Newport Litigation  

In 2016, two putative class actions lawsuit captioned Dixon Chung v. Newport Corp., et al., Case No. 

A-16-733154-C, and Hubert C. Pincon v. Newport Corp., et al., Case No. 

A-16-734039-B, were filed in the District Court, Clark County, Nevada on behalf of a putative class of stockholders of Newport for claims related to the merger agreement (“Newport Merger Agreement”) between the Company, Newport, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”). The lawsuits named as defendants the Company, Newport, Merger Sub, and certain then current and former members of Newport’s board of directors. Both complaints alleged that Newport directors breached their fiduciary duties to Newport’s stockholders by agreeing to sell Newport through an inadequate and unfair process, which led to inadequate and unfair consideration, by agreeing to unfair deal protection devices and by omitting material information from the proxy statement. The complaints also alleged that the Company, Newport and Merger Sub aided and abetted the directors’ alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties. The Court consolidated the actions, and plaintiffs later filed an amended complaint captioned In re Newport Corporation Shareholder Litigation, Case No. 

A-16-733154-B, in the District Court, Clark County, Nevada, on behalf of a putative class of Newport’s stockholders for claims related to the Newport Merger Agreement. The amended complaint alleged Newport’s former board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to Newport’s stockholders and that the Company, Newport and Merger Sub had aided and abetted those breaches. It sought monetary damages, including 

pre- and post-judgment interest. In June 2017, the Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismissed the amended complaint against all defendants but granted plaintiffs leave to amend.  

On July 27, 2017, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint containing substantially similar allegations but naming only Newport’s former directors as defendants. On August 8, 2017, the Court dismissed the Company and Newport from the action. The second amended complaint seeks monetary damages, including

 pre- and post-judgment interest. The Court granted a motion for class certification on September 27, 2018, appointing Mr. Pincon and Locals 302 and 612 of the International Union of Operating Engineers

 - Employers Construction Industry Retirement Trust as class representatives. On June 11, 2018, plaintiff Dixon Chung was voluntarily dismissed from the litigation. On May 1, 2019, the Court granted the defendants’ motion to strike plaintiffs’ jury demand and determined that the case will be tried by the Court, and not a jury. 

Discovery in the action is complete. On August 9, 2019, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint,

Overview  

We are a global provider of instruments, subsystems and process control solutions that measure, monitor, deliver, analyze, power and control critical parameters of advanced manufacturing processes to improve process performance and productivity for our customers. Our products are derived from our core competencies in pressure measurement and control, flow measurement and control, gas and vapor delivery, gas composition analysis, residual gas analysis, leak detection, control technology, ozone generation and delivery, power, reactive gas generation, vacuum technology, lasers, photonics, 

sub-micron positioning, vibration control, optics and laser-based manufacturing solutions. We also provide services relating to the maintenance and repair of our products, installation services and training. Our primary served markets include semiconductor, industrial technologies, life and health sciences, research and defense. 

Acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc.  

On February 1, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (“ESI”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 29, 2018 (the “ESI Merger”). At the effective time of the ESI Merger and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, each share of ESI’s common stock that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger was converted into the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without interest and subject to deduction of any required withholding tax. We paid the former ESI stockholders aggregate consideration of approximately $1.033 billion, excluding related transaction fees and expenses, and 

non-cash consideration related to the exchange of share-based awards of approximately $31 million for a total purchase consideration of approximately $1.063 billion. We funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of our available cash on hand and the proceeds from our senior secured term loan facility as described below. 

Segments and Markets  




sub-micron positioning, vibration control, and optics. 

We have a diverse base of customers. Approximately 52% and 44% of our net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were from sales to customers in our advanced markets. These include, but are not limited to, industrial technologies, life and health sciences, and research and defense. 

Approximately 48% and 56% of our net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were from sales to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers.  

We expect the relative split in our net revenues between sales to customers in our advanced markets and sales to customers in our semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer and semiconductor device manufacturer markets will be relatively consistent for the foreseeable future, excluding the impact of any future acquisitions.


Table of Contents 





The semiconductor capital equipment industry has been experiencing a moderation in capital spending in the past twelve months and we have seen a similar effect on our semiconductor revenue over the same period. However, while the timing of a full market recovery remains uncertain, we are seeing improving market conditions. The semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to rapid demand shifts, which are difficult to predict, and we cannot be certain as to the timing or extent of future demand or any future weakness in the semiconductor capital equipment industry. 

A significant portion of our net revenues is from sales to customers in international markets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, international net revenues accounted for approximately 53% and 50% of our total net revenues, respectively. A significant portion of our international net revenues was from China, South Korea, Germany and Japan. We expect that international net revenues will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total net revenues. Long-lived assets located in the United States were $177 million and $147 million, as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term 

tax-related accounts. Long-lived assets located outside of the United States were $91 million and $77 million, as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term 

tax-related accounts. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2018, other than the adoption of ASC 842 as outlined below.  

Leases  

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”), Leases, (“ASU 

2016-02”), to enhance the transparency and comparability of financial reporting related to leasing arrangements. We adopted ASU 

2016-02 on January 1, 2019, or the effective date, and used the effective date as our date of initial application. 

At the inception of an arrangement, we determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the facts and circumstances present. Most leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as 

right-of-use assets, short-term lease liabilities and long-term lease liabilities. We have elected not to recognize on the balance sheet leases with terms of one year or less. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding 

right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining fixed lease term. Certain adjustments to the 

right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received. In calculating the present value of future lease payments, we utilize our incremental borrowing rates, which are the rates incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. We have elected to utilize a single blended interest rate based on currencies, geographies and lease terms that comprise the lease portfolio. 


Table of Contents 

Although separation of lease and 

non-lease components is required, certain practical expedients are available. Entities may elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and 

non-lease components. We have elected to account for the lease and 

non-lease  components of each of our operating leases as a single lease component and allocate all of the contract consideration to the lease component only. The lease component results in an operating 

right-of-use asset being recorded on the balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis as lease expense. 

Many of our leases contain options to renew and extend lease terms, and options to terminate leases early. We do not recognize the 

right-of-use asset or lease liability for renewal or termination periods unless we are reasonably certain to exercise the option at lease inception. 

For further information about our critical accounting policies, including our revenue recognition policy, please see the discussion of critical accounting policies in our Annual Report on Form 

10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the section captioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”

Results of Operations  





Table of Contents 







Gross profit as a percentage of net product revenues decreased by 4.5 percentage points for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to lower factory utilization and lower revenue volumes, partially offset by favorable product mix.  

Gross profit as a percentage of net service revenues increased by 5.1 percentage points and 0.8 percentage points for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to favorable absorption and favorable product mix, partially offset by higher material costs.

step-up adjustment to fair value from purchase accounting of $7.6 million. Excluding this adjustment, the gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 would have been 43.6% for this period. 


Research and development expenses increased $9.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to $7.2 million from the ESI Merger, which primarily included $4.5 million of compensation-related expenses, $1.1 million of project materials and $0.8 million of depreciation expense, and an increase of $2.3 million of project materials related to the legacy MKS business.  

Research and development expenses increased $19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to $18.7 million from the ESI Merger, which primarily included $12.2 million of compensation-related expenses, $2.4 million of project materials, $2.2 million of depreciation expense and $1.0 million of occupancy costs, and an increase of $1.8 million of project materials related to the legacy MKS business.  

Our research and development efforts are primarily focused on developing and improving our instruments, components, subsystems and process control solutions to improve process performance and productivity.  

We have thousands of products, and our research and development efforts primarily consist of a large number of projects related to these products, none of which is individually material to us. Current projects typically have durations of 3 to 30 months depending upon whether the product is an enhancement of existing technology or a new product. Our current initiatives include projects to enhance the performance characteristics of older products, to develop new products and to integrate various technologies into subsystems. These projects support in large part the transition in the semiconductor industry to smaller integrated circuit geometries and in the flat panel display and solar markets to larger substrate sizes, which require more advanced process control technology. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in research and development, fees paid to consultants, material costs for prototypes and other expenses related to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our products.  

We believe that the continued investment in research and development and ongoing development of new products are essential to the expansion of our markets. We expect to continue to make significant investment in research and development activities. We are subject to risks from products not being developed in a timely manner, as well as from rapidly changing customer requirements and competitive threats from other companies and technologies. Our success primarily depends on our products being designed into new generations of equipment for the semiconductor industry and advanced technology markets. We develop products that are technologically advanced so that they are positioned to be chosen for use in each successive generation of semiconductor capital equipment. If our products are not chosen to be designed into our customers’ products, our net revenues may be reduced during the lifespan of those products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $11.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributed to $9.6 million from the ESI Merger, which primarily included $6.1 million of compensation-related expense, $1.0 million of depreciation expense, $0.7 million of travel and entertainment expense and $0.4 million of commissions expense. The increase was also attributed to an increase of $1.3 million of compensation-related expense, $0.8 million of information technology related expenses and $0.6 million of bad debt expense related to the legacy MKS business.  

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $17.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributed to $27.9 million from the ESI Merger, which primarily included $17.6 million of compensation-related expense, $3.1 million of depreciation expense, $1.7 million of travel and entertainment expense and $1.7 million of consulting and professional fees. The increase was also attributed to an increase of $1.5 million of information technology related expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $9.8 million of compensation-related expense and $1.7 million of depreciation expense, related to the legacy MKS business.  


We recorded fees and expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, related to Amendment No. 6 which included the fifth repricing of our Term Loan Facility and the combination of the two existing tranches of our Term Loan Facility with a maturity date in February 2026. We also recorded fees and expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 related to Amendment No. 5, which established a second tranche for our term loan commitment in the original principal amount of $650 million. We recorded fees and expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 related to the fourth repricing of our 2016 Term Loan Facility.  


We recorded acquisition and integration costs related to the ESI Merger, which closed on February 1, 2019, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. These costs consisted primarily of compensation costs for certain executives from ESI who had change in control provisions in their respective ESI employment agreements that were accounted for as dual-trigger arrangements and other stock vesting accelerations, as well as consulting and professional fees associated with the ESI Merger.  

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, we reversed a portion of acquisition and integration costs recognized during previous periods related to the acquisition of Newport Corporation in April 2016 (the “Newport Merger”), related to severance agreement provisions that were not met.

We recorded restructuring costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, which consisted primarily of severance costs related to an organization-wide reduction in workforce, the consolidation of service functions in Asia and the movement of certain products to low cost regions. We also recorded expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 related to a legal settlement from a contractual obligation we assumed as part of the Newport Merger.  

Restructuring costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were primarily comprised of severance costs related to transferring a portion of our shared services functions to a third party as well as the consolidation of certain shared service functions in Asia. We also recorded environmental costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, related to an Environmental Protection Agency-designated Superfund site, which was acquired as part of the Newport Merger.  


Amortization of intangible assets increased by $6.3 million and $17.5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the ESI Merger.  


Interest expense, net, increased by $10.1 million and $22.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, primarily due to interest expense related to Amendment No. 5 as described below.  


The changes in other (income) expense, net, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily related to changes in foreign exchange rates.  


Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were 14.4% and 20.4%, respectively. Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, and related income tax expense, were lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate due to the deduction for foreign derived intangible income, the geographic mix of income earned by our international subsidiaries being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate and the impact of various tax credits, offset by the global intangible 

low-taxed income inclusion and a correction of an 

out-of-period error with respect to deferred tax assets related to limitations on the deduction of executive compensation in the amount of $5.0 million. This correction, which was recorded during the 


Table of Contents 

quarter ended June 30, 2018, but should have been recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2018, increased our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019 by 9.8%, 7.5% and 3.8%, respectively. The error and subsequent adjustment were not material to prior or current interim and annual financial statements.  

Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were 18.5% and 17.6%, respectively. Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months September 30, 2018, and related income tax expense, were lower than the U.S. statutory rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates, windfall benefits of stock compensation and the deduction for foreign derived intangible income, offset by the tax effect of the provision for global intangible low taxed income inclusion and state income taxes.  

As of September 30, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $41.2 million. At December 31, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $32.7 million. The net increase is primarily attributable to the addition of historical gross unrecognized tax benefits for ESI as a result of the ESI Merger during the quarter ended March 31, 2019. As of September 30, 2019, excluding interest and penalties, there were approximately $33.4 million of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact our annual effective tax rate. We accrue interest and, if applicable, penalties for any uncertain tax positions. Interest and penalties are classified as a component of income tax expense. As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively.  

Over the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that we may recognize approximately $1.2 million of previously net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, related to federal, state and foreign tax positions as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitation. The U.S. statute of limitations remains open for tax years 2016 through present. The statute of limitations for our tax filings in other jurisdictions varies between fiscal years 2013 through the present. We also have certain federal credit carry-forwards and state tax loss and credit carry-forwards that are open to examination for tax years 2000 through the present.  

We are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service commenced an examination of our U.S. federal income tax filings for tax years 2015 and 2016 during the quarter ended September 30, 2017. This audit was effectively settled during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and the impact was not material. Also during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 we received notification from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service of their intent to audit our U.S. subsidiary, Newport Corporation, for tax year 2015. This audit commenced during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and was effectively settled during the quarter ended June 30, 2019 with a no change result.  

On a quarterly basis, we evaluate both positive and negative evidence that affects the realizability of net deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance. The future benefit to be derived from our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in each jurisdiction of the right type to realize the assets.  

Our future effective tax rate depends on various factors, including further interpretations and guidance from U.S. federal and state governments on the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the adoption of the proposed regulations on the foreign derived intangible income and additional regulations on the global intangible 

low-taxed income provision, as well as the geographic composition of our 

pre-tax income, and changes in income tax reserves for unrecognized tax benefits. We monitor these factors and timely adjust our estimates of the effective tax rate accordingly. We expect that the geographic mix of 

pre-tax income will continue to have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate, however the geographic mix of 

pre-tax income can change based on multiple factors resulting in changes to the effective tax rate in future periods. While we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could materially differ from our accrued positions as a result of uncertain and complex application of tax law and regulations. Additionally, the recognition and measurement of certain tax benefits include estimates and judgment by management. Accordingly, we could record additional provisions or benefits for U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax matters in future periods as new information becomes available. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable investments totaled $475.1 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $718.2 million at December 31, 2018. This decrease primarily related to the use of $406.0 million of cash to fund the payment of a portion of the purchase price for ESI on February 1, 2019.  

Net cash provided by operating activities was $167.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and resulted from net income of $97.6 million, which included 

non-cash charges of $139.5 million, offset by a net increase in working capital of $69.9 million. The net increase in working capital was due to an increase in inventories of $25.8 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $24.0 million, an increase in other current and 

non-current assets of $18.2 million, a decrease in accrued compensation of $13.4 million, a decrease in income taxes of $0.8 million, offset by a decrease in trade accounts receivable of $9.3 million and an increase in other current and 

non-current liabilities of $3.0 million. 


Table of Contents 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $278.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and resulted from net income of $321.3 million, which included 

non-cash charges of $99.1 million, offset by a net increase in working capital of $142.1 million. The net increase in working capital was due to an increase in inventories of $80.4 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $23.1 million and an increase in other current and 

non-current assets of $17.7 million, related to an increase in business activities, a decrease in accrued compensation of $15.5 million, a decrease in income taxes of $13.9 million and a decrease in accounts payable $0.4 million. These increases in working capital were offset by an increase in other current and 

non-current  liabilities of $8.9 million. 

Net cash used in investing activities was $907.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and was primarily due to the payment of a portion of the purchase price for the ESI Merger of $988.6 million and purchases of production-related equipment of $44.7 million, offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $84.4 million and proceeds from the sale of long-lived assets of $41.2 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $47.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, due to the purchases of production-related equipment of $36.9 million and net purchases of short-term investments of $10.5 million.  

Net cash provided by financing activities was $490.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and was primarily from net proceeds of $534.3 million, mainly from our 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, as described below, used to finance the ESI Merger, offset by dividend payments made to common stockholders of $32.6 million and net payments related to tax payments for employee stock awards of $11.7 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $167.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and resulted from the repurchase of common stock of $75.0 million, partial repayment of our Term Loan Facility of $50.0 million, dividend payments made to common stockholders of $31.6 million and net payments related to tax payments for employee stock awards of $13.6 million, partially offset by net borrowings relating to our lines of credit of $2.7 million.  

On July 25, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $200 million of our outstanding common stock from time to time in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or through other appropriate means. The timing and quantity of any shares repurchased depends upon a variety of factors, including business conditions, stock market conditions and business development activities, including but not limited to merger and acquisition opportunities. These repurchases may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. We have repurchased approximately 2,588,000 shares of common stock for approximately $127.0 million pursuant to the program since its adoption. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, there were no repurchases of common stock. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, we repurchased approximately 818,000 shares of our common stock for $75.0 million, for an average of $91.67 per share.  

Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our Board of Directors. In addition, we accrue dividend equivalents on the restricted stock units we assumed in the ESI Merger when dividends are declared by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share during each of the first, second and third quarters of 2019, respectively, which totaled $32.6 million, or $0.60 per share. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per share during the first quarter of 2018 and $0.20 per share during the second and third quarters of 2018, which totaled $31.6 million, or $0.58 per share.  

On October 28, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on December 6, 2019 to shareholders of record as of November 25, 2019. Future dividend declarations, if any, as well as the record and payment dates for such dividends, are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. In addition, under the terms of the Term Loan Facility and ABL Facility, each as defined below, we may be restricted from paying dividends under certain circumstances.  

Term Loan Credit Agreement  


The Wall Street Journal, (3) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00%, and (4) a floor of 1.75%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin; or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a LIBOR rate floor of 0.0%, plus an applicable margin. The Company has elected the interest rate as described in clause (b). The Credit Agreement provides that, unless an alternate rate of interest is agreed, all loans will be determined by reference to the base rate if the LIBOR rate cannot be ascertained, if regulators impose material restrictions on the authority of a lender to make LIBOR rate loans, or for other reasons. The 2016 Term Loan Facility was issued with original issue discount of 1.00% of the principal amount thereof.  


Table of Contents 

We subsequently entered into four separate repricing amendments to the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which decreased the applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings from 4.0% to 1.75%, with a LIBOR rate floor of 0.75%. As a consequence of the pricing of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility (defined below), the applicable margin for the 2016 Term Loan Facility was increased to 2.00% (from 1.75%) with respect to LIBOR borrowings and 1.00% (from 0.75%) with respect to base rate borrowings.  

On September 30, 2016, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of September 30, 2020, to fix the rate on $335.0 million of the then-outstanding balance of the 2016 Term Loan Facility. The rate was fixed at 1.198% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 1.75% at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, the notional amount of this transaction was $250.0 million and it had a fair value asset of $1.2 million.  

We incurred $28.7 million of deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method.  

On February 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the ESI Merger, we entered into an amendment (“Amendment No. 5”) to the Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 5 provided an additional tranche

 B-5 term loan commitment in the original principal amount of $650.0 million (the “2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility”), all of which was drawn down in connection with the closing of the ESI Merger. Pursuant to Amendment No. 5, we also effectuated certain amendments to the Credit Agreement which make certain of the negative covenants and other provisions less restrictive. Prior to the effectiveness of Amendment No. 6 (as defined below), the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility had a maturity date of February 1, 2026 and bore interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, a base rate or LIBOR rate (as described above) plus, in each case, an applicable margin equal to 1.25% with respect to base rate borrowings and 2.25% with respect to LIBOR borrowings. The 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility was issued with original issue discount of 1.00% of the principal amount thereof. 

On April 3, 2019, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of March 31, 2023, to fix the rate on $300.0 million of the then-outstanding balance of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility. The rate was fixed at 2.309% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 1.75% at September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, the notional amount of this transaction was $300.0 million and it had a fair value liability of $8.1 million.  

We incurred $11.4 million of deferred finance fees and original issue discount fees related to the term loans under the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method.  

On September 27, 2019, we entered into an amendment (“Amendment No. 6”) to the Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 6 refinanced all existing loans outstanding under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility (“Existing Term Loans”) for a tranche 

B-6 term loan commitment in the original principal amount of $896.8 million (“2019 Term Loan Refinancing Facility”). Each lender of the Existing Term Loans who elected to participate in the 2019 Term Loan Refinancing Facility was deemed to have exchanged the aggregate outstanding principal amount of its Existing Term Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement for an equal aggregate principal amount of tranche 

B-6 term loans under the 2019 Term Loan Refinancing Facility. On the effective date of Amendment No. 6 and immediately prior to the exchanges described above, we made a voluntary prepayment of $50.0 million, which was applied to the Existing Term Loans on a pro rata basis. 

We incurred $2.2 million of original issue discount fees related to the term loans under the 2019 Term Loan Refinancing Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method.  

As of September 30, 2019, the remaining balance of deferred finance fees and original issue discount of the Term Loan Facility was $12.3 million. A portion of the deferred finance fees and original issue discount have been accelerated in connection with the various debt prepayments and extinguishments during 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.  

The 2019 Term Loan Refinancing Facility matures on February 2, 2026, and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, a base rate or LIBOR rate (as described above) plus, in each case, an applicable margin equal to 0.75% with respect to base rate borrowings and 1.75% with respect to LIBOR borrowings. The 2019 Term Loan Refinancing Facility was issued with original issue discount of 0.25% of the principal amount thereof.  

We are required to make scheduled quarterly payments each equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the 2019 Term Loan Refinancing Facility with the balance due on February 2, 2026. If, on or prior to the date that is six months after the closing date of Amendment No. 6, we prepay any loans under the 2019 Term Loan Refinancing Facility in connection with a repricing transaction, we must pay a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the loans so prepaid.  

As of September 30, 2019, after total principal prepayments of $525.0 million (which includes a $50.0 million prepayment made during the three months ended September 30, 2019) and regularly scheduled principal payments of $10.4 million, the total outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan Facility was $894.6 million and the interest rate was 3.59%.

Under the Credit Agreement, we are required to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with portions of our annual excess cash flow as well as with the net cash proceeds of certain of our asset sales, certain casualty and condemnation events and the incurrence or issuance of certain debt. As a result of our current total leverage ratio, we are not required to make a prepayment of excess cash flow for the period ended September 30, 2019.  

All obligations under the Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, and are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and the assets of such subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions.  

The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. If an event of default occurs, the Lenders under the Term Loan Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Term Loan Facility and all actions generally permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. At September 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.  

Senior Secured Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility  



The Wall Street Journal, (3) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00% and (4) a floor of 0.00%; and (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, with a floor of 0.00%. The initial applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility is 0.50% with respect to base rate borrowings and 1.50% with respect to LIBOR borrowings. Commencing with the completion of the first fiscal quarter ending after the closing of the ABL Facility, the applicable margin for borrowings thereunder is subject to upward or downward adjustment each fiscal quarter, based on the average historical excess availability during the preceding quarter. 

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal under the ABL Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder equal to 0.25% per annum. We must also pay customary letter of credit fees and agency fees.  

We incurred $0.8 million of costs in connection with the ABL Facility, which were capitalized and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of five years of the ABL Facility. As a result of a prior asset-based facility being terminated concurrently with our entry into the ABL Facility, we wrote off $0.2 million of previously capitalized debt issuance costs.  

The ABL Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the ABL Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the ABL Facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. We have not borrowed against this ABL Facility to date.  

Sale of Long-Lived Assets

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which are often established for the purpose of facilitating 

off-balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Accordingly, we have no 

off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably expected to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   

Information concerning market risk is contained in the section entitled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” contained in our Annual Report on Form 

10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2019. As of September 30, 2019, there were no material changes in our exposure to market risk from December 31, 2018. 

 ITEM 4. 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2019. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 


15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2019, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

 ITEM 1. 

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.   

Newport Litigation  

In 2016, two putative class actions lawsuit captioned Dixon Chung v. Newport Corp., et al., Case No. 

A-16-733154-C, and Hubert C. Pincon v. Newport Corp., et al., Case No. 

A-16-734039-B, were filed in the District Court, Clark County, Nevada on behalf of a putative class of stockholders of Newport Corporation (“Newport”) for claims related to the merger agreement (“Newport Merger Agreement”) between the Company, Newport, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”). The lawsuits named as defendants the Company, Newport, Merger Sub, and certain then current and former members of Newport’s board of directors. Both complaints alleged that Newport directors breached their fiduciary duties to Newport’s stockholders by agreeing to sell Newport through an inadequate and unfair process, which led to inadequate and unfair consideration, by agreeing to unfair deal protection devices and by omitting material information from the proxy statement. The complaints also alleged that the Company, Newport and Merger Sub aided and abetted the directors’ alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties. The Court consolidated the actions, and plaintiffs later filed an amended complaint captioned In re Newport Corporation Shareholder Litigation, Case No. 

A-16-733154-B, in the District Court, Clark County, Nevada, on behalf of a putative class of Newport’s stockholders for claims related to the Newport Merger Agreement. The amended complaint alleged Newport’s former board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to Newport’s stockholders and that the Company, Newport and Merger Sub had aided and abetted these breaches. It sought monetary damages, including 

pre- and post-judgment interest. In June 2017, the Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismissed the amended complaint against all defendants but granted plaintiffs leave to amend. 

On July 27, 2017, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint containing substantially similar allegations but naming only Newport’s former directors as defendants. On August 8, 2017, the Court dismissed the Company and Newport from the action. The second amended complaint seeks monetary damages, including

 pre- and post-judgment interest. The Court granted a motion for class certification on September 27, 2018, appointing Mr. Pincon and Locals 302 and 612 of the International Union of Operating Engineers - Employers Construction Industry Retirement Trust as class representatives. On June 11, 2018, plaintiff Dixon Chung was voluntarily dismissed from the litigation. On May 1, 2019, the Court granted the defendants’ motion to strike plaintiffs’ jury demand and determined that the case will be tried by the Court, and not a jury. Discovery in the action is complete. On August 9, 2019, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint, which was denied on October 10, 2019. On August 23, 2019, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. A bench trial is scheduled for January 2020. 

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
