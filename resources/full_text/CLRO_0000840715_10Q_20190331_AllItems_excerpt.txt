1. Business Description, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies 


ClearOne, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “ClearOne” or the “Company”), is a global market leader enabling conferencing, collaboration, and AV streaming solutions for voice and visual communications. The performance and simplicity of our advanced, comprehensive solutions offer unprecedented levels of functionality, reliability and scalability. 


The fiscal year for ClearOne is the twelve months ending on December 31. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ClearOne and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

These accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and are not audited. Certain information and footnote disclosures that are usually included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) have been either condensed or omitted in accordance with SEC rules and regulations. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, and the cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full-year period. These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC. 


The significant accounting policies were described in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. There have been no changes to these policies during the three months ended March 31, 2019 that are of significance or potential significance to the Company except for the change in accounting for leases as described below.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 



ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Under the available practical expedient, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. 






3. Earnings (Loss) Per Share 

Earnings (loss) per common share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and, when appropriate, dilutive potential common stock outstanding during the period. Stock options are considered to be potential common stock. The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share does not assume exercise or conversion of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect. 

Basic earnings (loss) per common share is the amount of net earnings (loss) for the period available to each weighted-average share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is the amount of earnings (loss) for the period available to each weighted-average share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period and to each share of potential common stock outstanding during the period, unless inclusion of potential common stock would have an anti-dilutive effect.

The current year loss did not result in income tax benefit due to recording a full valuation allowance against expected benefits. The valuation allowance was recorded as we concluded that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets were not realizable primarily due to the Company's recent pre-tax losses.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

ClearOne is a global Company that designs, develops and sells conferencing, collaboration, and AV networking solutions for voice and visual communications. The performance and simplicity of our advanced, comprehensive solutions offer a high level of functionality, reliability and scalability. 

We derive a major portion of our revenue from audio conferencing products and microphones by promoting our products in the professional audio-visual channel. We have extended our total addressable market from the installed audio conferencing market to adjacent complementary markets – microphones, video collaboration and AV networking. We have achieved this through strategic technological acquisitions as well as by internal product development. 


We also introduced COLLABORATE® Space to our growing family of collaboration solutions. It’s a suite that unifies messaging, calls and meetings and will energize workflows and increase productivity for everyone involved in the enterprise. Designed as a persistent, user-friendly collaboration suite, COLLABORATE Space contains many powerful UCC capabilities, as well as the seamless ability to make calls outside the network. With COLLABORATE Space, users can work together one-on-one, or in groups of hundreds, with integrated file sharing, searchable archives, and user presence information. They can connect with colleagues and contacts, via audio and video, with the most intuitive collaboration tools. Users can meet immediately or schedule a meeting and access a full suite of collaboration features, including file sharing, whiteboarding, annotation, chat, and meeting minutes.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

During the first quarter, we continued our serious litigation efforts to stop infringement of our strategic patents. We also continue our programs to cut costs and to speed up product development that we believe will enable us to get back to a growth path. 

Overall revenue declined in the first quarter of 2019 when compared to the first quarter of 2018, with declines seen in all product categories except video. We believe the on-going infringement of ClearOne’s patents is the major cause of our revenue decline in the audio conferencing and microphones categories.  

Our gross profit margin decreased to 43% during the first quarter of 2019 from 56% for the first quarter of 2018. Gross profit margin decreased primarily due to reduced overhead absorption into inventory as we continue to reduce our net spend on inventory. 

Net loss increased from $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 to $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in net loss in 2019 was primarily due to reduced gross profit and reduced tax benefit partially offset by reduction in operating expenses.  

Industry conditions 

We operate in a very dynamic and highly competitive industry which is dominated on the one hand by a few players with respect to certain products like traditional video conferencing appliances while on the other influenced heavily by a fragmented reseller market consisting of numerous regional and local players. The industry is also characterized by venture capitalist funded start-ups and private companies willing to fund cumulative cash losses in order to gain market share and achieve certain non-financial goals. 

Economic conditions, challenges and risks 

The audio-visual products market is characterized by intense competition and rapidly evolving technology. Our competitors vary within each product category. Our installed professional audio conferencing products, which is our flagship product category, continue to be ahead of the competition despite the reduction in revenues. Our strength in this space is largely due to our fully integrated suite of products consisting of DSP mixers, wide range of professional microphone products and video collaboration products. Despite our strong leadership position in the installed professional audio conferencing market, we face challenges to revenue growth due to the limited size of the market and pricing pressures from new competitors attracted to the commercial market due to higher margins. 

Revenue from our video products are critical to our long-term growth. We face intense competition in this market from well-established market leaders as well as emerging players rich with marketing funds. We expect our strategy of combining Spontania, our cloud-based video conferencing product, Collaborate, our appliance-based media collaboration product, our high-quality professional cameras, and our high-end audio conferencing technology will generate high growth in the near future. We believe we are also well positioned to capitalize on the continuing migration away from the traditional hardware-based video conferencing systems to software-based video conferencing applications. 

We derive a major portion of our revenue (approximately 47% for the year ended December 31, 2018) from international operations and expect this trend to continue in the future. Most of our revenue from outside the U.S. is billed in U.S. dollars and is not exposed to any significant currency risk. However, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk if the U.S. dollar is strong against other currencies as it will make U.S. Dollar denominated prices of our products less competitive. 

A detailed discussion of our results of operations follows below. 

Results of Operations for the first quarter of 2019 



Table of Contents  

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 


Revenue 

Our revenue decreased to $6.3 million in 2019 compared to $7.3 million in 2018. The highest decline was seen in audio conferencing category with 11% decline followed by microphones with 9% decline. Revenue from video products grew by 13% on the back of growth in sales of videoconferencing appliances, cameras and cloud-based videoconferencing services. The decline in audio conferencing category was due to decline in all subcategories including professional installed audio conferencing, personal conferencing and tabletop conferencing. The decline in microphones category was due to decline in beamforming microphones. The on-going infringement of ClearOne’s patents is the major cause of our revenue decline in audio conferencing and microphones categories.  

The share of audio conferencing products in our product mix declined marginally from 50% in 2018-Q1 to 43% in 2019-Q1. The share of microphones slightly improved from 32% to 33%. Share of video products in the revenue mix increased from 18% to 24%. 

During 2019-Q1 revenue declined across all major markets except Middle East, India and Central Europe. The decline was more pronounced in the Canada, Australia, Japan and Northern Europe. Asia Pacific including Middle East decreased by 9%, Europe and Africa declined by 14% and Americas declined by 13%. 

We believe, although there can be no assurance, that we will return to growth path when our strategic initiatives namely product innovation, cost reduction and defense of our intellectual property succeed. 

Costs of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 

Cost of goods sold (“COGS”) includes expenses associated with finished goods purchased from outsourced manufacturers, the manufacture of our products (including material and direct labor), our manufacturing and operations organization, property and equipment depreciation, warranty expense, freight expense, royalty payments, and the allocation of overhead expenses. 

Our gross profit for 2019-Q1 was approximately $2.7 million or 43% compared to approximately $4.1 million, or 56%, for 2018-Q1. Gross margin for 2019-Q1 declined mainly due to reduced overhead absorption into inventory due to continued declined in inventory purchasing activity. 

Our profitability in the near-term continues to depend significantly on our revenues from professional installed audio conferencing products. We hold long-term inventory and if we are unable to sell our long-term inventory, our profitability might be affected by inventory write-offs and price mark-downs.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Operating Expenses 








Other income (expense), net 

Other income (expense), net, includes interest income, interest expense, and foreign currency changes. 

Other income marginally increased in 2019-Q1 compared to higher interest income.  

Provision for income taxes 

During 2019-Q1, we did not recognize any benefit from the losses incurred due to setting up of full valuation allowance. During 2018-Q1 we accrued income taxes at the forecasted effective tax benefit rate of 27.0% 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

As of March 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $4.3 million compared to $11.2 million as of December 31, 2018. Our working capital was $22.9 million and $28.3 million as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 

Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $1.3 million in 2019-Q1, an increase of cash used of approximately $1.0 million from $0.3 million of cash used in operating activities in 2018-Q1. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash outflows due to change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.2 million and an increase in net loss by $0.5 million, partially offset by increase in non-cash charges of $0.7 million. 

Net cash used by investing activities was $5.6 million for 2019-Q1 compared to net cash flows provided by investing activities of $1.0 million during the 2018-Q1, an increase in cash used of $6.6 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of marketable securities of approximately $6.8 million. 

Capitalization of patent defense costs. We capitalize external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents when we believe that a significant, discernible increase in value will result from the defense and a successful outcome of the legal action is probable. When we capitalize patent defense costs we amortize the costs over the remaining estimated useful life of the patent, which is 15 to 17 years. During 2019-Q1 we spent $1.2 million of legal costs related to the defense of our patents and capitalized the entire amount. 


Table of Contents  

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $9 thousand during 2019-Q1. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $0.7 million during 2018-Q1, which consisted of cash outflows of $0.1 million on repurchase and cancellation of stock and $0.6 million for dividend payments. 

We are currently pursuing all available legal remedies to defend our strategic patents from infringement. We have already spent about $9.7 million from 2016 through March 31, 2019 towards this litigation and may be required to spend more to continue our legal defense. We have been actively engaged in preserving cash by suspending our dividend program, allowing the share repurchase program to expire and implementing company-wide cost reduction measures. In addition, we expect to generate additional cash as our inventory levels are brought down to historical levels. We also believe that the measures taken by us will yield higher revenues in the future. We believe all of these and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to meet our short-term and long-term operating requirements and finance our growth plans. We also believe that our strong portfolio of intellectual property and our solid brand equity in the market will enable us to raise additional capital if and when needed to meet our short and long-term financing needs. In addition to capital expenditures, we may use cash in the near future for selective infusions of technology, sales and marketing, infrastructure, and other investments to fuel our growth. 

At March 31, 2019, we had open purchase orders related to our electronics manufacturing service providers of approximately $2.1 million, primarily related to inventory purchases. 

At March 31, 2019, we had inventory totaling $20.8 million, of which non-current inventory accounted for $8.5 million. This compares to total inventories of $22.2 million and non-current inventory of $9.0 million as of December 31, 2018. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We have no off-balance-sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial conditions, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources, results of operations or liquidity. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial position are based upon our unaudited consolidated financial statements included under Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. We believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations. Except with respect to our revenue recognition practices included in Note 1. “Business Description, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” under Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, there have been no changes to the critical accounting policies as explained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Table of Contents  

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

An evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2019 was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Principal Financial and Accounting Officer. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2019 due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described below. 

Management identified a material weakness in the operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting relating to the accurate and timely reporting of its financial results and disclosures and its testing and assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner.  

To address the material weakness, management is working with our third party internal controls consultant to assist with the implementation of a remediation plan which will supplement the existing controls. The remediation plan will include an assessment of personnel levels and responsibilities, additional training of financial reporting personnel and ability to handle new requirements and projects on a timely basis with respect to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and public company reporting requirements and timelines. The material weakness will be fully remediated when, in the opinion of management, the control processes have been operating for a sufficient period of time to provide reasonable assurance as to their effectiveness. The remediation and ultimate resolution of the material weakness will be reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 

Except as noted above, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2019, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
