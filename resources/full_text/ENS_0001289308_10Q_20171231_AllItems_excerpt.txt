NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)


1. Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included, unless otherwise disclosed. Operating results for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018. 

The consolidated condensed balance sheet at March 31, 2017 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. 

The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K (SEC File No. 001-32253), which was filed on May 30, 2017 (the “2017 Annual Report”).

The Company reports interim financial information for 13-week periods, except for the first quarter, which always begins on April 1, and the fourth quarter, which always ends on March 31. The four quarters in fiscal 2018 end on July 2, 2017, October 1, 2017, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018, respectively. The four quarters in fiscal 2017 ended on July 3, 2016, October 2, 2016, January 1, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively.

The consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially owned subsidiaries that the Company has the ability to control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” providing guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB voted to delay the effective date for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permissible one year earlier. The standard permits the use of either modified retrospective or full retrospective transition methods. The Company has substantially completed an impact assessment of the potential changes from adopting ASU 2014-09. The impact assessment included a review of customer arrangements across all of its global business units and an in-depth analysis of its global revenue processes and accounting policies to identify potential areas where change may be needed to comply with this guidance. The Company plans to apply the modified retrospective transition method. The Company assembled an implementation work team to assess and document the accounting conclusions for the adoption of ASU 2014-09. Based on this analysis, the Company does not believe the adoption of the ASU will have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to assess the potential impact on accounting policies, internal control processes and related disclosures required under the new guidance.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). This update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.


In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)”, which requires an entity to report the service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the same line item as other compensation costs. The other components of net (benefit) cost will be required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 

15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.





3. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Recurring Fair Value Measurements




The fair values of lead forward contracts are calculated using observable prices for lead as quoted on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) and, therefore, were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in its 2017 Annual Report.

The fair values for foreign currency forward contracts are based upon current quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2 based on the nature of the underlying market in which these derivatives are traded.

Financial Instruments

The fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to their short maturities. 

The fair value of the Company’s short-term debt and borrowings under the new 2017 Credit Facility and the previous 2011 Credit Facility (each as defined in Note 9), approximate their respective carrying value, as they are variable rate debt and the terms are comparable to market terms as of the balance sheet dates and are classified as Level 2.

The Company's 5.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”), with an original face value of $300,000, were issued in April 2015. The fair value of these Notes represent the trading values based upon quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2. The Notes were trading at approximately 104% and 101% of face value on December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. 




4. Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company utilizes derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates under established procedures and controls. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The Company’s agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions and the Company anticipates performance by counterparties to these contracts and therefore no material loss is expected.

Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships

Lead Forward Contracts

The Company enters into lead forward contracts to fix the price for a portion of its lead purchases. Management considers the lead forward contracts to be effective against changes in the cash flows of the underlying lead purchases. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. At December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company has hedged the price to purchase approximately 54.0 million pounds and 45.0 million pounds of lead, respectively, for a total purchase price of $60,849 and $46,550, respectively.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of the Company’s foreign currency exposures for lead, as well as other foreign currency exposures so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the underlying foreign currency denominated exposures. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company had entered into a total of $52,801 and $30,751, respectively, of such contracts.

In the coming twelve months, the Company anticipates that $3,133 of pretax gain relating to lead and foreign currency forward contracts will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) as part of cost of goods sold. This amount represents the current net unrealized impact of hedging lead and foreign exchange rates, which will change as market rates change in the future, and will ultimately be realized in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income as an offset to the corresponding actual changes in lead costs to be realized in connection with the variable lead cost and foreign exchange rates being hedged.

Derivatives not Designated in Hedging Relationships

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany loans and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. These are not designated as hedging instruments and changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded directly in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the notional amount of these contracts was $24,132 and $13,560, respectively.

The Company’s income tax provision consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. The tax provision for the third quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017 was based on the estimated effective tax rates applicable for the full years ending March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively, after giving effect to items specifically related to the interim periods. The Company’s effective income tax rate with respect to any period may be volatile based on the mix of income in the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates, change in tax laws and the amount of the Company's consolidated income before taxes. 

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was enacted into law. Among the significant changes resulting from the law, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on unrepatriated cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. In accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” the Company is required to record the effects of tax law changes in the period enacted. The rate change is administratively effective at the beginning of the Company's fiscal year, using a blended rate for the annual period. As a result, the Company's blended U.S. statutory tax rate for fiscal 2018 is 31.5%.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company has not completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act; however, in certain cases, as described below, the Company made a reasonable estimate of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. The Company's results for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, contain estimates of the impact of the Tax Act as permitted by Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 “SAB 118” issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2017. These amounts are considered provisional and may be affected by future guidance if and when issued. 




Finally, the Company recorded a provisional tax benefit of $1,947 related to the reduction of the fiscal 2018 federal tax rate to 31.5%.

In all cases, the Company may adjust these provisional amounts which could potentially affect the measurement and impact on tax expense as the Company refines its calculations within a reasonable period not to exceed one year from the enactment date.

The consolidated effective income tax rates for the third quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017 were 141.2% and 26.7%, respectively, and for the nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017 were 63.2% and 25.7%, respectively. The rate increase in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2017 is primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, offset by the German regulatory proceedings charge of $17,000 (with no associated tax benefit) recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. 

Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be 64% for fiscal 2018 compared to 60% for fiscal 2017. The foreign effective income tax rates for the nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017 were 11.4% and 15.9%, respectively. The rate decrease compared to the prior year period is primarily due to the German regulatory proceedings charge of $17,000 (with no associated tax benefit) recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. Income from the Company's Swiss subsidiary comprised a substantial portion of the Company's overall foreign mix of income and is taxed at an effective income tax rate of approximately 6%.




7. Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation

Litigation and Other Legal Matters

In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. These actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of environmental, anticompetition, employment, contract and other laws. In some of these actions and proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Company and its subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations, and threatened legal actions and proceedings. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by federal, state, local and foreign agencies, the Company and its subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders for documents, testimony and 

information in connection with various aspects of their activities.

European Competition Investigations 

Certain of the Company’s European subsidiaries had received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews from, and have had on-site inspections conducted by, the competition authorities of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands relating to conduct and anticompetitive practices of certain industrial battery participants. 

The Company settled the Belgian regulatory proceeding in February 2016 by acknowledging certain anticompetitive practices and conduct and agreeing to pay a fine of $1,962, which was paid in March 2016. As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company had a reserve balance of $2,058 and $1,830, respectively, relating to certain ancillary matters associated with the Belgian regulatory proceeding. The change in the reserve balance between December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017 was solely due to foreign currency translation impact. 

In June 2017, the Company settled a portion of its previously disclosed proceeding involving the German competition authority relating to conduct involving the Company's motive power battery business and agreed to pay a fine of $14,811, which was paid in July 2017. As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 and $13,463, respectively, relating to this matter. Also in June 2017, the German competition authority issued a fining decision related to the Company's reserve power battery business, which constitutes the remaining portion of the previously disclosed German proceeding. The Company is appealing this decision, including payment of the proposed fine of $11,415, and believes that the reserve power matter does not, based on current facts and circumstances known to management, require an accrual. The Company is not required to escrow any portion of this fine during the appeal process.

In July 2017, the Company settled the Dutch regulatory proceeding and agreed to pay a fine of $11,229, which was paid in August 2017. As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 and $10,258, respectively, relating to the Dutch regulatory proceeding.

As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company had a total reserve balance of $2,058 and $25,551, respectively, in connection with these investigations and other related legal matters, included in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. The foregoing estimate of losses is based upon currently available information for these proceedings. However, the precise scope, timing and time period at issue, as well as the final outcome of the investigations or customer claims, remain uncertain. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate may change from time to time, and actual losses could vary.

Environmental Issues

As a result of its operations, the Company is subject to various federal, state, and local, as well as international environmental laws and regulations and is exposed to the costs and risks of registering, handling, processing, storing, transporting, and disposing of hazardous substances, especially lead and acid. The Company’s operations are also subject to federal, state, local and international occupational safety and health regulations, including laws and regulations relating to exposure to lead in the workplace. 

The Company is responsible for certain cleanup obligations at the former Yuasa battery facility in Sumter, South Carolina, that predates its ownership of this facility. This manufacturing facility was closed in 2001 and the Company established a reserve for this facility, which was $1,117 and $1,123 as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017. Based on current information, the Company’s management believes this reserve is adequate to satisfy the Company’s environmental liabilities at this facility. This facility is separate from the Company’s current metal fabrication facility in Sumter.

Lead and Foreign Currency Forward Contracts

To stabilize its lead costs and reduce volatility from currency movements, the Company enters into contracts with financial institutions. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. Please refer to Note 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments for more details.

Common Stock



Accelerated Share Repurchase

During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”) with a major financial institution to repurchase up to $100,000 of its common stock. The Company prepaid $100,000 and received an initial delivery of 1,278,976 shares with a fair market value of approximately $80,000. The ASR is accounted for as a treasury stock repurchase, reducing the weighted average number of basic and diluted shares outstanding by the 1,278,976 shares initially received, and as a forward contract indexed to the Company's own common shares to reflect the future settlement provisions. Because the maximum repurchase will be $100,000, as of December 31, 2017, $20,000 representing the difference between the fair value of shares delivered and the maximum notional amount of $100,000, is accounted for as an equity instrument and is included in additional paid-in capital. The ASR is not accounted for as a derivative instrument.

No shares were received pursuant to the ASR during the current quarter. 

On January 9, 2018, the ASR was settled, and the Company received an additional 216,738 shares. See Note 15 - Subsequent Events, for more information.

Treasury Stock

During the nine months ended December 31, 2017, the Company also acquired 261,117 shares for $21,191 through open market purchases. 

 At December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company held 12,463,367 and 10,923,274 shares as treasury stock, respectively.

ITEM 2.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Reform Act”) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of EnerSys. EnerSys and its representatives may, from time to time, make written or verbal forward-looking statements, including statements contained in EnerSys’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and its reports to stockholders. Generally, the inclusion of the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “future,” “intend,” “estimate,” “will,” “plans,” or the negative of such terms and similar expressions identify statements that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that are intended to come within the safe harbor protection provided by those sections. All statements addressing operating performance, events, or developments that EnerSys expects or anticipates will occur in the future, including statements relating to sales growth, earnings or earnings per share growth, and market share, as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. The forward-looking statements are and will be based on management’s then-current beliefs and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance and on information currently available to management, and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements.

Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although we do not make forward-looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so, we cannot guarantee their accuracy. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements due to a number of uncertainties and risks, including the risks described in the Company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "2017 Annual Report") and other unforeseen risks.

These statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, even if subsequently made available by us on our website or otherwise, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons, including the following factors:

•general cyclical patterns of the industries in which our customers operate;

•the extent to which we cannot control our fixed and variable costs;

•the raw materials in our products may experience significant fluctuations in market price and availability;

•certain raw materials constitute hazardous materials that may give rise to costly environmental and safety claims;

•legislation regarding the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in our products;

•risks involved in our operations such as disruption of markets, changes in import and export laws, environmental regulations, currency restrictions and local currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•our ability to raise our selling prices to our customers when our product costs increase;

•the extent to which we are able to efficiently utilize our global manufacturing facilities and optimize our capacity;

•general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate;

•competitiveness of the battery markets and other energy solutions for industrial applications throughout the world;

•potential goodwill impairment charges, future impairment charges and fluctuations in the fair values of reporting units or of assets in the event projected financial results are not achieved within expected time frames;

•our debt and debt service requirements which may restrict our operational and financial flexibility, as well as imposing unfavorable interest and financing costs;

•our ability to maintain our existing credit facilities or obtain satisfactory new credit facilities;

•adverse changes in our short and long-term debt levels under our credit facilities;

•our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable-rate debt;

•our ability to attract and retain qualified management and personnel;

•our ability to maintain good relations with labor unions;

•credit risk associated with our customers, including risk of insolvency and bankruptcy;

•our ability to successfully recover in the event of a disaster affecting our infrastructure;

•terrorist acts or acts of war, could cause damage or disruption to our operations, our suppliers, channels to market or customers, or could cause costs to increase, or create political or economic instability; and

•the operation, capacity and security of our information systems and infrastructure.

This list of factors that may affect future performance is illustrative, but by no means exhaustive. Accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.

In the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition, certain financial measures may be considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. These rules require supplemental explanation and reconciliation, which is provided in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. EnerSys’ management uses the non-GAAP measures “primary working capital” and “primary working capital percentage” in its evaluation of business segment cash flow and financial position performance. These disclosures have limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for cash flow determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Management believes that this non-GAAP supplemental information is helpful in understanding the Company’s ongoing operating results.

Overview

Reserve power products also include thermally managed cabinets and enclosures for electronic equipment and batteries.

•Motive power products are used to provide power for electric industrial forklifts used in manufacturing, warehousing and other material handling applications as well as mining equipment, diesel locomotive starting and other rail equipment. 

Economic Climate

Recent indicators continue to suggest a mixed trend in economic activity among the different geographical regions. North America and EMEA are experiencing moderate economic growth. Our Asia region continues to grow faster than any other region in which we do business.

Volatility of Commodities and Foreign Currencies

Our most significant commodity and foreign currency exposures are related to lead and the Euro, respectively. Historically, volatility of commodity costs and foreign currency exchange rates have caused large swings in our production costs. As the global economic climate changes, we anticipate that our commodity costs and foreign currency exposures may continue to fluctuate as they have in the past several years. Over the past year, on a consolidated basis, we have experienced rising commodity costs. 

Customer Pricing

Our selling prices fluctuated during the last several years to offset the volatile cost of commodities. Approximately 30% of our revenue is currently subject to agreements that adjust pricing to a market-based index for lead. During the nine months of fiscal 2018, we increased our selling prices in response to increased commodity costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe that our financial position is strong, and we have substantial liquidity with $571 million of available cash and cash equivalents and available and undrawn credit lines of approximately $504 million at December 31, 2017 to cover short-term liquidity requirements and anticipated growth in the foreseeable future.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into a new credit facility (“2017 Credit Facility”) that comprises a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolver”) and a $150 million senior secured term loan (“2017 Term Loan”) with a maturity date of September 30, 2022. We repaid the existing facility (“2011 Credit Facility”), which comprised a $500 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“2011 Revolver”) and a $150 million senior secured incremental term loan (the “2011 Term Loan”) with the proceeds of the new facility. We believe that the 2017 Credit Facility provides us with sufficient liquidity to fund acquisitions and stock repurchase programs.

In the nine months of fiscal 2018, we repurchased $121 million of treasury stock through an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with a major financial institution and through open market purchases. Share repurchases and a decline in our share price helped offset the dilutive impact of stock awards in the nine months of fiscal 2018. 

A substantial majority of the Company’s cash and investments are held by foreign subsidiaries and are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and expected to be utilized to fund local operating activities, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions. The Company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic and foreign liquidity.

We believe that our strong capital structure and liquidity affords us access to capital for future acquisition and stock repurchase opportunities and continued dividend payments.

The Asia segment’s net sales increased $17.2 million or 26.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily due to a 17% increase in organic volume and a 5% increase each in pricing and foreign currency translation impact. Net sales increased $19.6 million or 9.4% in the nine months of fiscal 2018, as compared to the nine months of fiscal 2017, primarily due to a 4% increase each in pricing and organic volume and a 1% increase due to foreign currency translation impact.

Product line sales



Net sales of our reserve power products in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $55.7 million or 20.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to a 11% increase in organic volume and a 5% increase each in pricing and foreign currency translation impact. Net sales of our reserve power products in the nine months of fiscal 2018 increased $79.7 million or 9.4% compared to the nine months of fiscal 2017, primarily due to a 4% increase each in organic volume and pricing and a 1% increase due to foreign currency translation impact. 

Net sales of our motive power products in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by $39.5 million or 13.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to a 5% increase each in organic volume and foreign currency translation impact and a 4% increase in pricing. Net sales of our motive power products in the nine months of fiscal 2018 increased $78.8 million or 8.8% compared to the nine months of fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to a 4% increase in pricing, a 3% increase due to organic volume and a 2% increase due to foreign currency translation impact. 

Gross Profit 



Gross profit increased $11.0 million or 7.1% in the third quarter and $6.4 million or 1.3% in the nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2017. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 240 basis points and 200 basis points in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively. The decrease in the gross profit margin in both the third quarter and nine months is primarily due to an increase in commodity costs of approximately $34 million and $102 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in organic volume and pricing.

Operating Items 



NM = not meaningful

Operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, increased $11.7 million but decreased as a percentage of net sales by 40 basis points. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in an increase of $2.4 million. Excluding this impact of the foreign currency translation, the increase in dollars was primarily due to payroll related expenses and our investment relating to the development of our digital core and new products, which were partially offset by our cost saving initiatives. 

Operating expenses for the nine months of fiscal 2018 increased $6.0 million but decreased as a percentage of net sales by 100 basis points. The impact of foreign currency translation resulted in an increase of $2.8 million. Excluding this impact of the foreign currency translation, the increase in dollars was primarily due to the aforementioned investment in our digital core and new products, partially offset by cost saving initiatives.

Selling expenses, our main component of operating expenses, were 51.9% and 52.4% of total operating expenses in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, compared to 56.9% and 54.5% of total operating expenses in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively.

Restructuring Charges

Included in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 operating results are restructuring charges of $1.0 million in the Americas and $0.8 million in EMEA. The charges in the Americas relate to improving efficiencies of our general operations, while charges in EMEA relate to restructuring programs to improve efficiencies in our motive power production, supply chain and general operations. 

Included in our third quarter of fiscal 2017 operating results is a credit of $1.2 million relating to restructuring and other exit charges in EMEA consisting of cash charges of $0.5 million primarily relating to severance and a credit of $1.7 million relating to South Africa joint venture exit activities. In addition, cost of goods sold also includes a $0.5 million credit of inventory adjustment relating to the South Africa joint venture. Included in our nine months of fiscal 2017 operating results is a $5.0 million charge consisting of restructuring and other exit charges in EMEA of $3.7 million, restructuring charges of $0.9 million in the Americas and $0.4 million in Asia. Of the restructuring and exit charges in EMEA of $3.7 million, $2.5 million of restructuring charges related to European manufacturing operations and $1.2 million of exit charges related to our joint venture in South Africa. In addition, cost of goods sold also includes a $2.1 million inventory adjustment charge relating to the South Africa joint venture. 

Fiscal 2017 - Legal Proceedings Charge 

In connection with previously disclosed matters involving European anticompetition authorities, included in the operating results for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017 were $17.0 million of charges involving the German competition authority. In July 2017, we paid a fine of $14.8 million relating to conduct involving our motive power business. We are currently appealing the German competition authority’s fining decision related to our reserve power battery business. For more detailed information, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.

Operating Earnings



NM = not meaningful



NM = not meaningful

Operating earnings increased $13.3 million or 24.4% and increased $18.0 million or 9.8% in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017. Operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, increased 60 basis points and 10 basis points, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017. Excluding the impact of the $6.3 million write-off of previously capitalized costs relating to the ERP system implementation in our Americas region during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, operating earnings in the current nine months decreased 30 basis points due to an increase in lead cost, partially offset by price recoveries and cost saving initiatives. 

The Americas segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring charges, decreased 240 basis points and 100 basis points, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, when compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher commodity costs partially offset by price recoveries and cost saving initiatives. Excluding the impact of the $6.3 million write-off of previously capitalized costs relating to the ERP system implementation during the nine months of fiscal 2017, operating earnings in the nine months of fiscal 2018 decreased by 160 basis points compared to the prior year period.

The EMEA segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring charges and legal proceedings charge discussed above, decreased 40 and 140 basis points in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017, primarily due to an increase in lead cost, partially offset by price recoveries and cost saving initiatives. 

Operating earnings decreased 220 basis points and 90 basis points in the Asia segment in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, compared to the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher commodity costs, partially offset by price recoveries and a slow down in telecom spending during the first half of fiscal 2018 in the People's Republic of China.

Interest Expense



Interest expense of $6.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 (net of interest income of $0.8 million) was $0.9 million higher than the interest expense of $5.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 (net of interest income of $0.5 million). Interest expense of $18.7 million in the nine months of fiscal 2018 (net of interest income of $2.2 million) was $1.9 million higher than the interest expense of $16.8 million in the nine months of fiscal 2017 (net of interest income of $1.3 million). 

The increase in interest expense in both the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018 is primarily due to higher average debt outstanding. Our average debt outstanding was $727.1 million and $674.2 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, compared to $626.4 million and $629.2 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively. The increase in our average debt was primarily to fund treasury repurchase activity as discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.

Included in interest expense are non-cash charges for deferred financing fees of $0.3 million and $1.3 million, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, and $0.3 million and $1.0 million, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively.

Other (Income) Expense, Net



NM = not meaningful

Other (income) expense, net in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was income of $0.6 million compared to income of $1.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Other (income) expense, net in the nine months of fiscal 2018 was expense of $4.7 million compared to income of $0.4 million in the nine months of fiscal 2017. Foreign currency impact resulted in a gain of $0.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, and a loss of $4.4 million in nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to foreign currency gain of $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in the comparable prior year periods. 

Earnings Before Income Taxes



As a result of the above, earnings before income taxes in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $11.9 million, or 23.5%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and increased $11.0 million, or 6.5%, in the nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the nine months of fiscal 2017. 

Income Tax Expense 



NM = not meaningful

The Company’s income tax provision consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. The tax provision for the third quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017 was based on the estimated effective tax rates applicable for the full years ending March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively, after giving effect to items specifically related to the interim periods. Our effective income tax rate with respect to any period may be volatile based on the mix of income in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, change in tax laws and the amount of our consolidated income before taxes. 

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was enacted into law. Among the significant changes resulting from the law, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on unrepatriated cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. In accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” we are required to record the effects of tax law changes in the period enacted. The rate change is administratively effective at the beginning of our fiscal year, using a blended rate for the annual period. As a result, our blended U.S. statutory tax rate for fiscal 2018 is 31.5%.

As of December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act; however, in certain cases, as described below, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. Our results for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, contain estimates of the impact of the Tax Act as permitted by Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 “SAB 118” issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2017. These amounts are considered provisional and may be affected by future guidance if and when issued. 





Finally, we recorded a provisional tax benefit of $2.0 million related to the reduction of the fiscal 2018 federal tax rate to 31.5%. 

In all cases, we may adjust these provisional amounts which could potentially affect the measurement and impact on tax expense as we refine our calculations within a reasonable period not to exceed one year from the enactment date.

The consolidated effective income tax rates were 141.2% and 26.7%, respectively, for the third quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017 and 63.2% and 25.7%, respectively, for the nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017. The rate increase in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2017 is primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, offset by the German regulatory proceedings charge of $17.0 million (with no associated tax benefit) recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. 

Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be 64% for fiscal 2018 compared to 60% for fiscal 2017. The foreign effective income tax rates for the nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017 were 11.4% and 15.9%, respectively. The rate decrease compared to the prior year period is primarily due to the German regulatory proceedings charge of $17.0 million (with no associated tax benefit) recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. Income from our Swiss subsidiary comprised a substantial portion of our overall foreign mix of income and is taxed at an effective income tax rate of approximately 6%.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those discussed under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2017 Annual Report. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Operating activities provided cash of $129.9 million in the nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to $166.7 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2017. In the nine months of fiscal 2018, cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net earnings of $65.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $40.3 million, stock-based compensation of $14.8 million, deferred taxes benefit of $7.2 million, non-cash interest of $1.3 million and provision for doubtful accounts of $0.8 million. Cash provided by earnings as adjusted for non-cash items was improved by an increase of $89.2 million in long term liabilities primarily due to the one-time transition tax liability the Tax Act and was partially offset by the increase in primary working capital of $42.0 million, net of currency translation changes, and a decrease in accrued expenses of $30.5 million, comprising primarily of legal proceedings related payments, payroll related expenses and income taxes.

In the nine months of fiscal 2017, cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net earnings of $124.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $40.5 million, non-cash charges consisting of write-offs relating to restructuring and other exit charges and ERP implementation of $7.7 million, stock-based compensation of $14.6 million, provision of doubtful accounts of $2.0 million and non-cash interest of $1.0 million. Cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by the increase in primary working capital of $47.7 million, net of currency translation changes. Cash provided by operating activities were positively impacted by legal proceedings accrual of $17.0 million and accrued expenses of $13.9 million, comprising primarily of income and other taxes, while prepaid and other current assets, comprising primarily of prepaid taxes, resulted in an outflow of $11.5 million.

As explained in the discussion of our use of “non-GAAP financial measures,” we monitor the level and percentage of primary working capital to sales. Primary working capital for this purpose is trade accounts receivable, plus inventories, minus trade accounts payable. The resulting net amount is divided by the trailing three month net sales (annualized) to derive a primary working capital percentage. Primary working capital was $689.6 million (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 26.2%) at December 31, 2017, $624.8 million (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 24.9%) at March 31, 2017 and $611.6 million at January 1, 2017 (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 27.1%). The primary working capital percentage of 26.2% at December 31, 2017 is 130 basis points higher than that for March 31, 2017, and is 90 basis points lower than that for the prior year period. Primary working capital percentage increased during the nine months of fiscal 2018 largely due to higher inventory levels. The reason for the increase in inventory is due to rising lead costs, a longer supply chain on selective products and to meet rising fourth quarter demand.



Investing activities used cash of $45.7 million in the nine months of fiscal 2018 and primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $43.1 million, and a $3.0 million acquisition.

Investing activities used cash of $47.8 million in the nine months of fiscal 2017 and primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $36.0 million, and acquisitions of $12.4 million.

Financing activities used cash of $51.5 million in the nine months of fiscal 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into a 2017 Credit Facility. During the nine months of fiscal 2018, we borrowed $356.8 million under the 2017 Revolver and $150.0 million under the 2018 Term loan. Repayments on the 2017 Revolver during the nine months of fiscal 2018 were $111.5 million. Borrowings and repayments on the 2011 Revolver during the nine months of fiscal 2018 were $147.1 million and $312.1 million, respectively, and repayment of the 2011 Term loan was $127.5 million. On August 4, 2017, the outstanding balance on the 2011 Revolver and the 2011 Term Loan of $240.0 million and $123.0 million, respectively, was repaid utilizing the proceeds from the 2017 Credit Facility. We also paid $100.0 million under the ASR agreement, which was settled on January 9, 2018. Treasury stock open market purchases were $21.2 million, payment of cash dividends to our stockholders were $22.3 million, payment of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards were $7.5 million and debt issuance costs were $2.7 million. Net repayments on short-term debt were $1.4 million and proceeds from stock options were $0.8 million. 

Financing activities used cash of $23.6 million in the nine months of fiscal 2017 primarily due to revolver borrowings of $191.3 million and repayments of $186.8 million, repayment of our Term Loan of $11.3 million, payment of cash dividends to our stockholders of $22.8 million, and payment of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards of $7.7 million. Net borrowings on short-term debt were $13.6 million. 

Currency translation had a positive impact of $38.3 million on our cash balance in the nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to a negative impact of $25.4 million in the nine months of fiscal 2017. During the nine months of fiscal 2018, principal currencies in which we do business such as the Euro, Swiss franc, British pound, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi and Mexican peso strengthened versus the U.S. dollar. 

As a result of the above, total cash and cash equivalents increased by $71.0 million to $571.3 million, in the nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to an increase by $69.8 million to $467.1 million, in the comparable period of fiscal 2017.

All obligations under our 2017 Credit Facility are secured by, among other things, substantially all of our U.S. assets. The 2017 Credit Facility contains various covenants which, absent prepayment in full of the indebtedness and other obligations, or the receipt of waivers, limit our ability to conduct certain specified business transactions, buy or sell assets out of the ordinary course of business, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, pay dividends and take certain other actions. There are no prepayment penalties on loans under this credit facility.

We are in compliance with all covenants and conditions under our credit agreement and our 5.00% Senior Notes due 2023. We believe that we will continue to comply with these covenants and conditions, and that we have the financial resources and the capital available to fund the foreseeable organic growth in our business and to remain active in pursuing further acquisition opportunities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2017 Annual Report and Note 9 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a detailed description of our debt.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

A table of our obligations is contained in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Obligations of our 2017 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we entered into the new 2017 Credit Facility, comprising a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolver”) and a $150 million senior secured term loan (“2017 Term Loan”) with a maturity date of September 30, 2022. We repaid all outstanding balances on our 2011 Credit Facility as of August 4, 2017. 



$7.5 million payable in the first five years, beginning fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2024, $14.1 million in fiscal 2025, $18.9 in fiscal 2026 and the final payment of $23.5 million in fiscal 2027.

ITEM 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risks

Our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in raw material costs, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed.

Counterparty Risks

We have entered into lead forward purchase contracts and foreign exchange forward and purchased option contracts to manage the risk associated with our exposures to fluctuations resulting from changes in raw material costs and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company’s agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. Those contracts that result in a liability position at December 31, 2017 are $1.1 million (pre-tax). Those contracts that result in an asset position at December 31, 2017 are $0.9 million (pre-tax) and the vast majority of these will settle within one year. The impact on the Company due to nonperformance by the counterparties has been evaluated and not deemed material.

Interest Rate Risks

We are exposed to changes in variable U.S. interest rates on borrowings under our credit agreements as well as short-term borrowings in our foreign subsidiaries. 

A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense, on an annualized basis, by approximately $4.1 million on the variable rate portions of our debt.

Commodity Cost Risks – Lead Contracts




For the remaining quarter of this fiscal year, we believe approximately 100% of the cost of our lead requirements is known. This takes into account the hedge contracts in place at December 31, 2017, lead purchased by December 31, 2017 that will be reflected in future costs under our FIFO accounting policy, and the benefit from our lead tolling program. 

We estimate that a 10% increase in our cost of lead would have increased our cost of goods sold by approximately $18 million and $52 million, respectively, in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks

We manufacture and assemble our products globally in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. Approximately 50% of our sales and expenses are transacted in foreign currencies. Our sales revenue, production costs, profit margins and competitive position are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we manufacture or purchase goods relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold. Additionally, as we report our financial statements in U.S. dollars, our financial results are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the U.S. dollar. The principal foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the Euro, Swiss franc, British pound, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi and Mexican peso.

We quantify and monitor our global foreign currency exposures. Our largest foreign currency exposure is from the purchase and conversion of U.S. dollar based lead costs into local currencies in Europe. Additionally, we have currency exposures from intercompany financing and 

intercompany and third party trade transactions. On a selective basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and purchase option contracts to reduce the impact from the volatility of currency movements; however, we cannot be certain that foreign currency fluctuations will not impact our operations in the future.

We hedge approximately 10% - 15% of the nominal amount of our known foreign exchange transactional exposures. We primarily enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of the variation of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. 

Gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged. The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged items. We also selectively hedge anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure, primarily with foreign currency exchange contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with Topic 815 - Derivatives and Hedging.

At December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% movement in the exchange rates would have adversely changed our hedge valuations by approximately $2.8 million and $3.6 million, respectively.

ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES



PART II OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business. See Litigation and Other Legal Matters in Note 7 - Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 1A.Risk Factors


Future changes in U.S. tax law could adversely affect us or our affiliates.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. President signed into law a sweeping tax reform bill known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (“Tax Act”). The effects of the Tax Act are not yet entirely clear and will depend on, among other things, additional regulatory and administrative guidance, as well as any statutory technical corrections that are subsequently enacted. While the Tax Act reduces the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate generally applicable to U.S. corporations, the Tax Act could nevertheless have a significant adverse effect on the U.S. federal income taxation of our and our subsidiaries’ operations, including by limiting or eliminating various deductions or credits (including interest expense deductions and deductions relating to employee compensation), imposing taxes with respect to certain accumulated earnings of non-U.S. entities on a current basis, changing the timing of the recognition of income or its character and imposing additional corporate taxes under certain circumstances to combat perceived base erosion issues, among other changes. 

The Tax Act, or any related, similar or amended legislation or other changes in U.S. federal income tax laws, could adversely affect the U.S. federal income taxation of our and our affiliates’ ongoing operations and may also adversely affect the integration efforts relating to, and potential synergies from, past strategic transactions. Any such changes and related consequences could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.

Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers

The following table summarizes the number of shares of common stock we purchased from participants in our equity incentive plans as well as repurchases of common stock authorized by the Board of Directors. As provided by the Company’s equity incentive plans, (a) vested options outstanding may be exercised through surrender to the Company of option shares or vested options outstanding under the Company’s equity incentive plans to satisfy the applicable aggregate exercise price (and any withholding tax) required to be paid upon such exercise and (b) the withholding tax requirements related to the vesting and settlement of restricted stock units and market condition-based share units may be satisfied by the surrender of shares of the Company’s common stock.
