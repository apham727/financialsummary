CSI's Chief Executive Officer Roger H.D. Lacey commented, "Our Q1 2019 results reflect the initial impact of restructuring efforts to shift our corporate focus towards higher-margin and faster-growing markets such as IoT and network edge management. During the quarter, we continued to invest in the development of new products, improve quality control processes, initiate cost savings for each business unit, and streamline our accounting processes. As a result, we improved operational efficiencies in our business units and on a corporate level. Our efforts resulted in significant improvement in gross margin and we are reporting positive operating and net income in Q1 2019." 

Mr. Lacey continued, "As part of our enterprise-wide restructuring process, in April 2019 we completed the sale of Suttle's FutureLinkTM Fiber product line for $5 million. This was a key step towards our goal of re-focusing our operations and returning to profitability in 2019. We are pursuing a number of other initiatives, including the further streamlining of Suttle's existing operations and the announced sale of our corporate headquarters." 

Mr. Lacey concluded, "We believe CSI is now a fundamentally strong company and we expect 2019 to be a transformational year. Although quarterly performance may vary (due to timing of contracts and customer projects), for FY 2019, as compared to FY 2018, we expect to improve our top and bottom line, increase our customer base and expand in new markets. We are working diligently to evolve from a network services and product manufacturing company into a growing and profitable cloud-based IoT and network edge solutions company. Our strong balance sheet provides us with the resources for growth. At March 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $9.5 million, working capital of $31.2 million, and shareholders' equity of $42.1 million." 

Q1 2019 Segment Financial Overview  

Transition Networks 


Q1 2019 sales decreased by $263,000 or 3% as compared to Q1 2018. Sales in North America decreased $731,000, or 10%, primarily due to timing of orders from the federal government and a large carrier customer. International sales increased $468,000, or 31%, primarily due to a significant project with a customer in our EMEA region for media converter products, partially offset by weakness in our ROW region. Media converter sales increased 4% or $194,000 due to the large EMEA project. Sales of Ethernet switches and adapters decreased 12% or $260,000 due to timing of orders from the federal government. All other product sales decreased 12% or $197,000 due to slower activity in our ancillary products business. 

Gross profit for Q1 2019 decreased to $3,754,000 from $3,927,000 in the same period of 2018. Gross margin decreased to 42.2% in Q1 2019 from 42.9% in Q1 2018, primarily due to product mix related to a large project in the EMEA region. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7% to $3,695,000, or 41.6% of sales, in Q1 2019 compared to $3,466,000, or 37.9% of sales, in Q1 2018 due to an increase in engineering expenses related to prototype development and employee-related expenses. 

Transition Networks had operating income of $59,000 in Q1 2019 as compared to operating income of $461,000 in Q1 2018. 

Mr. Lacey commented, "We believe the Q1 2019 Transition Networks' revenue shortfall is primarily a timing issue and the remainder of 2019 currently looks strong with several POE++ projects in process." 

Suttle 


Suttle sales decreased 21% in Q1 2019 to $5,521,000 from $6,973,000 in the same period of 2018 due to reduced spending from Tier 1 telecommunications providers, volume declines in legacy products, and a continuing shift in purchasing decisions from Tier 1 telecommunications suppliers to installers. 

Suttle's gross profit increased 31% in Q1 2019 to $1,801,000 from $1,375,000 in the same period of 2018. Gross margin in Q1 2019 increased to 32.6% from 19.7% in the same period of 2018 due to overall favorable product mix changes, price increases at Tier 1 telecom customers, workforce reductions made at the end of 2018, together with lower Q1 2019 inventory adjustments and increased production primarily related to Suttle's sale of its FutureLinkTM fiber product line on April 5, 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 46% to $1,058,000, or 19.2% of sales, in Q1 2019 from $1,975,000, or 28.3% of sales, in the same period in 2018 primarily due to workforce reductions made at the end of 2018. 

Suttle reported operating income of $743,000 in Q1 2019 as compared to an operating loss of $600,000 in Q1 2018. 

As previously disclosed, on April 5, 2019, the Company sold its Suttle FutureLink™ Fiber business line, including inventory, equipment, and customer relationships, to PPC Broadband Inc. ("PPC"). The transaction was structured as an Asset Purchase Agreement with a simultaneous signing and closing. The sale price was $5.0 million in cash. Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, Suttle and PPC entered into a Transition Services Agreement under which Suttle will continue to manufacture products related to the FutureLink ™ Fiber business line until September 30, 2019, to ensure seamless supply to the customer base. Suttle's 2018 and Q1 2019 revenues from its Fiber business were approximately $4.9 million and $1.1 million, respectively.  

Mr. Lacey commented, "While Suttle's Q1 2019's positive operating income reflects the result of many restructuring actions taken in prior periods and increased production related to the April 5, 2019 sale of the FutureLink™ Fiber business, we expect, due to the sale of this business and the impact on our production once we fulfill our the obligations under Transition Services Agreement, that Suttle's ongoing 2019 operating income will be much lower and closer to breakeven or could return to a loss."   

JDL Technologies 


JDL Technologies sales increased by 211% to $2,208,000 in Q1 2019 from $710,000 in Q1 2018. 

Revenues from the education sector increased by $1,364,000 in Q1 2019 from Q1 2018 due to the resumption of scheduled education projects funded by the federal government that were delayed in the prior year. Revenue from sales to small- and medium-sized commercial businesses, which are primarily healthcare and commercial clients, increased by $134,000, or 22%, due to ongoing efforts to expand managed services and infrastructure sales to these markets.  

Gross profit for Q1 2019 was $867,000 as compared to a loss of $18,000 in the same period in 2018 due to higher education revenue and the prior year having certain fixed costs on lower revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 11% in Q1 2019 to $376,000, or 17.0% of sales, from $424,000, or 59.7% of sales, in Q1 2018 due to lower selling and marketing expenses.  

JDL Technologies reported operating income of $491,000 in Q1 2019 as compared to an operating loss of $442,000 in the same period of 2018. 



Net2Edge's sales increased by 172% to $448,000 in Q1 2019 from $165,000 in Q1 2018, primarily due to revenue from established CSI accounts with new products with enhanced features. Gross profit increased by 115% to $221,000 in Q1 2019 from $103,000 in the same period of 2018, primarily due to higher revenue. Gross margin decreased to 49.3% in Q1 2019 from 62.4% in Q1 2018 due to product mix and costs associated with expediting raw materials. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 17% in Q1 2019 to $748,000 from $904,000 in Q1 2018 due to a reduction in selling expenses. Net2Edge's operating loss decreased to $527,000 in Q1 2019 from a loss of $801,000 in the same period of 2018. 

Financial Condition 

CSI's balance sheet at March 31, 2019 included cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $9.5 million, working capital of $31.2 million, and stockholders' equity of $42.1 million.
