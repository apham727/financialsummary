 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements




The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and therefore do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP); however, such information reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.

The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, some of the Company’s statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q may involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected future results. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year.

Error Correction and Reclassification

During the third quarter of 2018, the Company identified an error in prior periods presented for repairable service parts inventory balances. Prior-period amounts of inventory, product cost of sales, income tax expense, other current liabilities and retained earnings have been adjusted. Management determined that the correction of the error was not material to each prior period. This correction was recorded within the Company's operations in the Americas Banking reporting segment. As a result of applying the correction retrospectively, previously reported service cost of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 increased by $1.0 and $3.0, respectively, and previously reported net income and basic and diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.6 and $0.01 and $1.9 and $0.02, respectively. The decrease in the inventory balance and the aggregated amount of the correction reflected in other current liabilities and retained earnings as of December 31, 2017 was $8.1. There was no impact of the correction on previously reported cash flows from operations for the prior period.


The Company has reclassified the presentation of certain prior-year information to conform to the current presentation. The Company included finance lease receivables of $14.9 and $14.4 in other assets as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company reclassified $8.0 from other current assets to restricted cash as of December 31, 2017 in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and was included in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of September 30, 2017 in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)



Recently Issued Accounting Guidance



Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The amount of consideration can vary depending on discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties, or other similar items contained in the contract with the customer of which generally these variable consideration components represent less than one percent of revenues. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. 

The Company's payment terms vary depending on the individual contracts and are generally fixed fee. The Company recognizes advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue. In certain contracts where services are provided prior to billing, the Company recognizes a contract asset within trade receivables and other current assets.

FORM 10-Q as of September 30, 2018

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)



Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.

The Company recognizes shipping and handling fees billed when products are shipped or delivered to a customer and includes such amounts in net sales. Although infrequent, shipping and handling associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer is not a separate performance obligation, rather is accounted for as a fulfillment cost. Third-party freight payments are recorded in cost of sales.

The Company includes a warranty in connection with certain contracts with customers, which are not considered to be separate performance obligations. The Company provides its customers a manufacturer’s warranty and records, at the time of the sale, a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs. For additional information on product warranty refer to note 9. The Company also has extended warranty and service contracts available for its customers, which are recognized as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized on these contracts ratably as the Company has a stand-ready obligation to provide services when or as needed by the customer. This input method is the most accurate assessment of progress toward completion the Company can apply.

Nature of goods and services 

The following is a description of principal solutions offered within the Company's two main industry segments that generate the Company's revenue. For more detailed information about reportable operating segments, see note 20.

The Company provides its banking customers product-related services which include proactive monitoring and rapid resolution of incidents through remote service capabilities or an on-site visit. First and second line maintenance, preventive maintenance and on-demand services keep the distributed assets of the Company's customers up and running through a standardized incident management process. Managed services and outsourcing consists of the end-to-end business processes, solution management, upgrades and transaction processing. The Company also provides a full array of cash management services, which optimizes the availability and cost of physical currency across the enterprise through efficient forecasting, inventory and replenishment processes.

Banking and retail services may be sold separately or in bundled packages. The typical contract length for service is generally one year and is billed and paid in advance except for installations, among others. 

The Company's hardware-agnostic software applications facilitate millions of transactions via automated teller machines (ATMs), point of sale (POS) terminals, kiosks, and other self-service devices. The Company provides its banking customers front-end applications for consumer connection points and back-end platforms that manage channel transactions, operations and integration. For its retail customers, the Company provides a comprehensive, modular solution capable of enabling the most advanced omnichannel retail use cases. The Company's platform software is installed within bank and retail data centers to facilitate omnichannel transactions, endpoint monitoring, remote asset management, customer marketing, merchandise management and analytics. These offerings include highly configurable, application program interface (API) enabled software that automates legacy banking transactions across channels.

The Company’s software solution includes its professional services team, who provides systems integration, customization, consulting and project management. The Company’s advisory services team collaborates with its customers to help define optimal user experience, improve business processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technology to meet branch and store automation objectives.

Software licenses and professional services may be sold separately or in bundled packages. Software licenses when bundled with professional services, where the service is modifying the intellectual property (IP), is non-distinct from the professional service. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between distinct obligations in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates stand-alone selling prices using the cost plus expected margin approach or in the case of the software license the residual approach may be used. 

The Company considered ASC 606-10-32-34(c)(2), which provides the criteria that "the entity has not yet established a price for that good or service, and the good or service has not previously been sold on a standalone basis (that is, the selling price is uncertain)." The Company considers software as capable of being distinct, although it generally is not distinct in the context of 

DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

FORM 10-Q as of September 30, 2018

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)



the contract. Since the Company generally does not sell its software on a stand-alone basis there is limited history to accurately establish a stand-alone selling price. The Company does not have an established standalone selling price for its software.

Additionally, the Company considers the customization of the intellectual property significant since the professional services integrate the commercial solution with the customer's existing infrastructure. Although the services are capable of being distinct, they are not distinct within the context of the contract. The Company concluded this fully integrated commercial solution is inseparable since its customers generally only benefit from the combined output, which includes both the intellectual property and the professional services. The percentage of the Company's consolidated net sales recognized from integration and customization of software represented approximately one percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.

The Company’s software licenses are functional in nature (the IP has significant stand-alone functionality); as such, the revenue recognition of distinct software license sales is at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the rights granted by the license. Revenue from professional services are recognized over time, because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance as the services are performed or when the Company’s performance creates an asset with no alternative use to the Company and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Generally revenue will be recognized using an input measure, typically costs incurred.

Products for banking customers consist of cash recyclers and dispensers, intelligent deposit terminals, teller automation tools and kiosk technologies, as well as physical security solutions. The retail product portfolio includes modular, integrated and mobile POS and self-checkout (SCO) terminals that meet evolving automation and omnichannel requirements of consumers. Supplementing the POS system is a broad range of peripherals, including printers, scales and mobile scanners, as well as the cash management portfolio which offers a wide range of banknote and coin processing systems. Also in the portfolio, the Company provides self-checkout terminals and ordering kiosks which facilitate an efficient and user-friendly purchasing experience. The Company’s hybrid product line can alternate from an attended operator to self-checkout with the press of a button as traffic conditions warrant throughout the business day.

For bundled packages, the Company accounts for individual services separately if they are distinct. A distinct service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate services or distinct obligations in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells the products or services. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates stand-alone selling prices using the cost plus expected margin approach. Revenue on service contracts is recognized ratably over time, generally using an input measure, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance as the services are performed. In some circumstances, when global service supply chain services are not included in a term contract and rather billed as they occur, revenue on these billed work services are recognized at a point in time as transfer of control occurs. Product revenue is recognized at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the product, which could be upon delivery or upon completion of installation services, depending on contract terms.

The Company considered ASC 606-10-32-34 during its assessment of standalone selling price for its software licenses sold, noting observable prices are not generally available due to high variability and customization related to its software and service solutions. The Company considered current market trends, geography, competitors and the effects of customization when concluding that observable prices were not available. The observed prices are highly variable due to the varying levels of customization of software solutions that help define optimal user experience, improve business processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technology to meet branch and store automation objectives. Due to the nature and level of customization that is included in the Company's software and service solutions, there is no expected cost plus margin approach available for the software component of the bundled packages. Margins can vary based on the customer, retail or banking solution and level of customization, which could include software solutions, as mentioned above, that help define optimal user experience, improve business processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technology to meet branch and store automation objectives. The Company's software licenses do not have clear identifiable fulfillment costs so the expected cost plus margin approach is not practical. The Company considered these factors when assessing the market assessment approach and the expected cost plus margin approach and concluded the residual approach was appropriate.

The Company allocates price between products and software net sales when hardware is sold. Hardware sales include operating system software that is required for the hardware to function. The Company generally allocates revenue using the residual method for software included in hardware sales.

The Company evaluates on a contract by contract basis software license sales that are standalone and software license sales that are accounted for under the residual method, but does not aggregate such sales. Software net sales using the residual approach represented approximately two percent of the Company's total consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.

Contract balances



DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

FORM 10-Q as of September 30, 2018

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)



Contract assets are minimal for the periods presented. The amount of revenue recognized in 2018 from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, mainly due to the changes in the estimate of variable consideration and contract modifications was de minimis. There have been $9.7 and $11.5 during the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $20.6 and $26.3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of impairment losses recognized as bad debt related to receivables or contract assets arising from the Company's contracts with customers.

As of January 1, 2018, the Company had $437.5 of unrecognized deferred revenue constituting the remaining performance obligations that are either unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied). In 2018, the Company recognized revenue of $241.4 related to the Company's deferred revenue balance at January 1, 2018.

Contract assets are the rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Contract assets of the Company primarily relate to the Company's rights to consideration for goods shipped and services provided but not contractually billable at the reporting date.

The contract assets are reclassified into the receivables balance when the rights to receive payment become unconditional. Contract liabilities are recorded for any services billed to customers and not yet recognizable if the contract period has commenced or for the amount collected from customers in advance of the contract period commencing. In addition, contract liabilities are recorded as advanced payments for products and other deliverables that are billed to and collected from customers prior to revenue being recognizable.

Transaction price and variable consideration

The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. This consideration can include fixed and variable amounts and is determined at contract inception and updated each reporting period for any changes in circumstances. The transaction price also considers variable consideration, time value of money and the measurement of any non-cash consideration, all of which are estimated at contract inception and updated at each reporting date for any changes in circumstances. Once the variable consideration is identified, the Company estimates the amount of the variable consideration to include in the transaction price by using one of two methods, expected value (probability weighted methodology) or most likely amount (when there are only two possible outcomes). The Company chooses the method expected to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled and applies the method consistently to similar contracts. Generally, the Company applies the expected value method when assessing variable consideration including returns and refunds.

The Company also applies the ‘as invoiced’ practical expedient in paragraph 606-10-55-18 related to performance obligations satisfied over time, which permits the Company to recognize revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice the customer if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date. Service revenues that are recognized ratably are primarily contracts that include first and second line maintenance. Service revenues that are recognized using input measures include primarily preventative maintenance. The ‘as invoiced’ practical expedient relates to the on-demand service revenue which is generally not under contract.

Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations

As of September 30, 2018, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $2,900. The Company expects to recognize revenue on the remaining performance obligations over the next twelve months. The Company enters into service agreements with cancellable terms after a certain period without penalty. Unsatisfied obligations reflect only the obligation during the initial term. The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. 

The Company also applies the ‘as invoiced’ practical expedient in paragraph 606-10-55-18 related to performance obligations satisfied over time which permits the Company to recognize revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice the customer if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date. Service revenues that are recognized ratably are primarily contracts that include first and second line maintenance. Service revenues that are recognized using input measures include primarily preventative maintenance. The ‘as invoiced’ practical expedient relates to the on-demand service revenue, which is generally not under contract.

Cost to obtain and cost to fulfill a contract 

The Company has minimal cost to obtain or fulfill contracts for customers for the periods presented. The Company pays commissions to the sales force based on multiple factors including but not limited to order entry, revenue recognition and portfolio growth. These incremental commission fees paid to the sales force meet the criteria to be considered a cost to obtain a contract, as they are directly attributable to a contract, incremental and management expects the fees are recoverable. The Company applies the practical expedient and recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. The costs that are not capitalized are included in cost of sales. The costs related to contracts with greater than a one-year term are immaterial and continue to be recognized in cost of sales.

Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of sales. The Company has minimal cost for shipping and handling costs for the periods presented.

Changes in accounting policies

Except for the changes below, the Company has consistently applied the accounting policies to all periods presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements.

The Company adopted Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, with a date of initial application of January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed below. 

The Company applied Topic 606 using the cumulative effect method - i.e., by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying Topic 606 as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at January 1, 2018. Therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under Topic 605. The Company applied the practical expedient related to assessment of contract modifications, whereby the Company is essentially allowed to use hindsight when assessing the effect of a modification and accounting for the modified contract as if it existed from the beginning of the original contract. 

The details of the significant changes and quantitative impact of the changes are set out below.

Professional service contracts

Previously, the Company recognized revenue for professional services contracts either on a milestone method or completed contract basis. Under Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control transfers to a customer. As professional services can be highly customized for each customer, there is no alternative use for the services. When there is an enforceable right to payment for service completed combined with no alternative use of the services, the services meet criteria for over time revenue recognition. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided and as the customer benefits from the service. Revenue is recognized progressively based on the costs incurred method. When the professional services are not highly customized as in basic software installation services, customers do not take control of the services until they are completed. Therefore, the Company continues to recognize revenue for such contracts when the services are completed and customers formally accept them.

In certain circumstances, a contract with a customer that contains a software arrangement may include provisions for customer acceptance. In these cases, when or as the performance obligation is satisfied, the Company recognizes revenue and records a contract asset until customer acceptance is received. Once customer acceptance is received, the contract asset is reclassified to accounts receivable. As of September 30, 3018, contract assets related to these arrangements are minimal. In situations where the performance obligation has not been met and the Company has not received customer acceptance, no revenue is recognized.

Customer acceptance provisions by their nature require the customer to approve that the Company satisfied its performance obligation and are generally standard throughout our contracts with customers.

If an instance arises where the Company would recognize revenue prior to customer acceptance, which occurs primarily when the Company provides bundled software and professional services, it is the Company's policy, pursuant to ASC 606, when or as the performance obligation is satisfied, to recognize revenue and record a contract asset or reduce deferred revenue, as applicable, 

DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

FORM 10-Q as of September 30, 2018

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)



until customer acceptance is received. Once customer acceptance is received, the contract asset is reclassified to trade receivables, net. In these circumstances, the Company would consider ASC 606-10-55-86 and -87 and conclude that although a standard method to transferring the software and services is not met, the standard terms of the customer acceptance provisions and favorable history of customer acceptances support revenue recognition prior to customer acceptance. The Company also would only recognize revenue prior to customer acceptance only if there were no remaining inputs related to performance obligation. These instances are currently immaterial. For certain contracts that contain customer acceptance clauses, such as customized software arrangements, the revenue is recognized pursuant to ASC 606-25 25-27(c) since the Company’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.

Impacts on financial statements

The following tables summarize the impacts of adopting Topic 606 on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2018 as if the Company continued to follow its accounting policies under the previous revenue recognition guidance.


The impact to net sales and cost of sales would have been decreases of $5.2 and $6.5, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and $19.0 and $15.1, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The impact after tax was $0.9 and $(2.7) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, and was primarily a result of timing of deferred revenue related to products and software for certain amounts being recognized that would have previously been deferred, and certain amounts being deferred that would have previously been recognized.


Basic earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding. Under the two-class method of computing earnings (loss) per share, non-vested share-based payment awards that contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends are considered participating securities. The Company’s participating securities include restricted stock units (RSUs), director deferred shares and shares that were vested but deferred by employees. The Company calculated basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share under both the treasury stock method and the two-class method. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, there were no differences in the earnings (loss) per share amounts calculated under the two methods. Accordingly, the treasury stock method is disclosed below.

In May 2018, the Company announced its decision to reallocate future dividend funds towards debt reduction and other capital resource needs.


The Company’s share-based compensation payments to employees are recognized based on their grant-date fair values during the period in which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. Share-based compensation is primarily recognized as a component of selling and administrative expense. Total share-based compensation expense was $6.9 and $8.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and was $27.2 and $23.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Performance shares are granted to employees and vest based on the achievement of certain performance objectives, as determined by the board of directors each year. Each performance share earned entitles the holder to one common share of the Company. The Company's performance shares include performance objectives that are assessed after a three-year period as well as performance objectives that are assessed annually over a three-year period. No shares are vested unless certain performance threshold objectives are met.

As of September 30, 2018, there were 0.1 non-employee director deferred shares vested and outstanding.

On April 25, 2018, the Company's shareholders approved amendments to the 2017 Plan, which provide for an additional 1.2 common shares available for award. The 2017 Plan is expected to attract and retain directors, officers and employees of the Company by providing incentives and rewards for performance.

The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Company applied the guidance in SAB 118 when accounting for the enactment date effects of the Tax Act. As of September 30, 2018, the Company has not completed the accounting for all the tax effects of the Tax Act. However, upon further analysis of certain aspects of the Tax Act and refinements to the Company’s calculations, the Company has increased the provisional estimate relating to deemed repatriation transition tax (transition tax) by $46.8. This increase in the provisional estimate has been included as a discrete item in the interim period ended September 30, 2018. The Company will continue to refine the provision estimate over the one-year measurement period ending December 31, 2018 which will include the period in which the Company filed its U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return. The final impacts of the Tax Act may differ materially as additional guidance and information becomes available and the U.S. federal tax filing, including transition tax, is complete.

The effective tax rate on the loss before taxes was (26.5) percent for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and (9.3) percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The expense on the loss for the three months ended and nine months ended was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge, the impacts of the Tax Act and the higher interest expense burden resulting from the debt restructuring. More specifically, the expense on the loss reflects refinement of the transition tax, the impacts related to global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) and the business interest deduction limitation which, as a result of the Company’s debt restructuring activities during the quarter, required a full valuation allowance on the current year nondeductible business interest expense. In addition, the benefit on the losses for the nine months is reduced by the goodwill impairment charge, which for tax purposes is primarily nondeductible, of $109.3 and $90.0 incurred in the third and second quarter, respectively. The effective tax rate could vary in future periods based on the Company’s earnings before taxes and clarification around the Tax Act.

The effective tax rate on the loss before taxes was 3.0 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 36.2 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The tax for the three months ended September 30, 2017 reflects an unfavorable adjustment relating to year-to-date changes in the Company’s valuation allowance as well as higher than anticipated losses incurred in jurisdictions with a full valuation allowance throughout the period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, the overall reduction in the tax benefit was offset by the repatriation of foreign earnings and the associated recognition of foreign tax credits as well as favorable discrete items associated with the release of uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and reductions in the Company’s deferred tax liability relating to undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings.




As a result of applying the correction of repairable service parts inventory retrospectively, a decrease in the inventory balance of $8.1 was reflected in the December 31, 2017 service parts balance previously reported.

The increase in finished goods inventory was primarily attributable to increased inventory in Germany and Mexico to satisfy various customer projects. Raw materials and work in process inventory increased primarily due to a build up of inventory in the U.S. to satisfy a recent large retail customer and certain supply chain issues.

The Company’s investments, primarily in Brazil, consist of certificates of deposit that are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in AOCI. Realized gains and losses are recognized in investment income and are determined using the specific identification method. There were no realized gains from the sale of securities or proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.




In May 2017, the Company announced a strategic partnership with Kony, a leading enterprise mobility and application company, to offer white label mobile application solutions for financial institutions and retailers. The Company acquired a minority equity stake in Kony, which is accounted for using the cost method of accounting. As of September 30, 2018, the Company's carrying value in Kony was $14.0 and the fair value was not estimated as there were no events or changes in circumstances in the investment. 

Securities and other investments also includes a cash surrender value of insurance contracts of $8.3 and $79.8 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

accounts. Credit quality is reviewed at inception and is re-evaluated as needed based on customer-specific circumstances. Receivable balances 60 days to 89 days past due are reviewed and may be placed on nonaccrual status based on customer-specific circumstances. Receivable balances are placed on nonaccrual status upon reaching greater than 89 days past due. Upon receipt of payment on nonaccrual financing receivables, interest income is recognized and accrual of interest is resumed once the account has been made current or the specific circumstances have been resolved.

As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the recorded investment in past due financing receivables on nonaccrual status was $0.4 and $0.6, respectively, and there were no recorded investments in finance receivables past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. The recorded investment in impaired notes receivable was $4.1 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and was fully reserved and as of September 30, 2018 are all greater than 89 days past due. 




The Company identified four reporting units, which are Eurasia Banking, Americas Banking, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Retail and Rest of World Retail. Management determined that the Americas Banking reporting unit had excess fair value of $168.4 or 25.9 percent cushion when compared to its carrying amount. The Eurasia Banking, EMEA Retail and Rest of World Retail reporting units had no excess fair value or cushion when compared to their carrying amounts. Changes in certain assumptions or the Company's failure to execute on the current plan could have a significant impact to the estimated fair value of the reporting units.

As a result of certain impairment triggering events, the Company performed an impairment test of goodwill for its four reporting units during the third quarter of 2018. Based on the results of the impairment testing, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $109.3 related to the Eurasia Banking, EMEA Retail and Rest of World Retail reporting units during the third quarter of 2018. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company performed an impairment test of goodwill for all of its line of businesses (LoB) reporting units due to the change in its reportable operating segments. Based on the results of the LoB testing, the fair values of each of the Company's reporting units exceed their carrying values except for the Services-Asia Pacific (AP) and Software-EMEA reporting units which resulted in a non-cash impairment loss of $90.0 during the second quarter 2018. The Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $199.3 during the nine months ended 2018. In 2017, the Company recorded impairments totaling $3.1 related to information technology (IT) transformation and integration activities.

During the third and second quarter 2018, the Company estimated the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of the income valuation and market approach methodologies. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions, including significant unobservable inputs. The key inputs included, but were not limited to, discount rates, terminal growth rates, market multiple data from selected guideline public companies, management’s internal forecasts which include numerous assumptions such as projected net sales, gross profit, sales mix, operating and capital expenditures and earnings before interest and taxes margins, among others. 



Amortization expense on capitalized software of $8.8 and $8.6 was included in service and software cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Amortization expense on capitalized software of $25.6 and $27.9 was included in service and software cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's total amortization expense, including deferred financing costs, was $38.2 and $42.7 the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's total amortization expense, including deferred financing costs, was $114.8 and $121.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

In 2018, the Company acquired the remaining portion of the noncontrolling interest in its China operations for $5.8 for which no goodwill was recorded. In 2017, the $5.6 acquired goodwill from Moxx Group B.V. (Moxx) and Visio Objekt GmbH (Visio) primarily relates to anticipated synergies achieved through increased scale and higher utilization of the service organization.


The Company provides its global operations guarantees and standby letters of credit through various financial institutions for suppliers, customers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers. If the Company is not able to make payments or fulfill contractual obligations, the suppliers, customers, regulatory agencies and insurance providers may draw on the pertinent bank. At September 30, 2018, the maximum future payment obligations related to these various guarantees totaled $157.6, of which $28.0 represented standby letters of credit to insurance providers, and no associated liability was recorded. At December 31, 2017, the maximum future payment obligations relative to these various guarantees totaled $195.1, of which $28.0 represented standby letters of credit to insurance providers, and no associated liability was recorded.

The Company provides its customers a manufacturer’s warranty and records, at the time of the sale, a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs. Estimated future obligations due to warranty claims are based upon historical factors such as labor rates, average repair time, travel time, number of service calls per machine and cost of replacement parts. The decrease in the liability was primarily due to warranties expiring in Brazil.

The Company has qualified retirement plans covering certain U.S. employees that have been closed to new participants since 2003 and frozen since December 2013. Plans that cover salaried employees provide retirement benefits based on an employee’s compensation during the ten years before the date of the plan freeze or the date of the employee's actual separation from service, if earlier. The Company’s funding policy for salaried plans is to contribute annually based on actuarial projections and applicable regulations.

The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business or financing activities. The Company’s derivative foreign currency instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and cash payments principally related to the Company’s non functional currency assets and liabilities. The Company's interest rate derivatives are used to manage the differences in amount due to variable rate interest rate borrowings.

As a result of the adoption of ASU 2017-12, $(0.4) and $2.4 was included in net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively and $(0.7) and $(0.6) in cost of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, which would have been included in foreign exchange gain (loss), net in the prior period. 

Foreign Exchange

Net Investment Hedges The Company has international subsidiaries with net balance sheet positions that generate cumulative translation adjustments within AOCI. The Company uses derivatives to manage potential changes in value of its net investments. The Company uses the forward-to-forward method for its quarterly measurement of ineffectiveness assessments of hedge effectiveness. No ineffectiveness results if the notional amount of the derivative matches the portion of the net investment designated as being hedged because the Company uses derivative instruments with underlying exchange rates consistent with its functional currency and the functional currency of the hedged net investment. Changes in value that are deemed effective are accumulated in AOCI where they will remain until they are reclassified to income together with the gain or loss on the entire investment upon substantial liquidation of the subsidiary. The fair value of the Company’s net investment hedge contracts was $2.4 and $2.0 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The net loss recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge derivative instruments was $2.7 and $2.7 in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The net loss recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge derivative instruments was $13.6 and $4.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

On August 15, 2016, the Company designated its €350.0 euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility as a net investment hedge of its investments in certain subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency in order to reduce volatility in stockholders' equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the euro with respect to the U.S. dollar. Effectiveness is assessed at least quarterly by confirming that the respective designated net investments' net equity balances at the beginning of any period collectively continues to equal or exceed the balance outstanding on the Company's euro-denominated term loan. Changes in value that are deemed effective are accumulated in AOCI. When the respective net investments are sold or substantially liquidated, the balance of the cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI will be reclassified into earnings. The net gain (loss) recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge foreign currency borrowings was $0.5 and $(12.0) for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The net gain (loss) recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge foreign currency borrowings was $4.9 and $(37.8) for the nine months September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. On March 30, 2017, the Company de-designated €130.6 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility and on May 9, 2017, the Company designated an additional €66.8 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility as a result of its repricing described under note 11. On September 21, 2017, the Company de-designated €101.1 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility. On June 21, 2018, the Company re-designated €30.2 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility. On July 23, 2018, the Company de-designated €180.2 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility. 

Non-Designated Hedges A substantial portion of the Company’s operations and revenues are international. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates can create substantial foreign exchange gains and losses from the revaluation of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. The Company’s policy allows the use of foreign exchange forward contracts with maturities of up

FORM 10-Q as of September 30, 2018

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)




Cash Flow Hedges The Company is exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies against its functional currency. At the Company, both sales and purchases are transacted in foreign currencies. The Company has certain subsidiaries with the euro (EUR) as its functional currency that are primarily exposed to the U.S. dollar (USD) and Great Britain pound sterling (GBP). This risk is considerably reduced by natural hedging (i.e., management of sales and purchases by choice location and suppliers). For a portion of the remaining risk that is not naturally hedged, foreign currency forwards are used to manage the exposure between EUR-GBP and EUR-USD.



Interest Rate

Cash Flow Hedges The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The Company has multiple pay-fixed receive-variable interest rate swaps outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $400.0.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. The fair value of the Company's interest rate contracts was $14.3 and $9.8 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. The Company estimates that a minimal amount will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense over the next year.

The Company has an interest rate swap for a nominal sum of €50.0, which was entered into in May 2010 with a ten-year term from October 1, 2010 until September 30, 2020. This interest rate swap mitigated the interest rate risk associated with the European Investment Bank debt, which was paid in full during 2017. For this interest rate swap, the three-month EURIBOR is received and a fixed interest of 2.97 percent is paid. The fair value, which is measured at market prices, as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $(5.4) and $(5.5), respectively. The interest rate contract is not designated and changes in the fair value of non-designated interest rate swap agreements are recognized in miscellaneous, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized $0.5 and $1.5 in interest expense relating to the interest rate swap for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.

Additionally, the Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any additional derivatives that are not designated as hedges.


Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value



The Company uses the end of period when determining the timing of transfers between levels. During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, there were no transfers between levels. 



Refer to note 11 for further details surrounding the Company's long-term debt as of September 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Additionally, the Company remeasures certain assets to fair value, using Level 3 measurements, as a result of the occurrence of triggering events. In the third and second quarter of 2018, in connection with certain triggering events, the Company performed an impairment test of goodwill for all of its reporting units, see note 8 further details. Besides goodwill from certain reporting units noted above, there were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the period presented.

Contractual Obligation

At September 30, 2018, the Company had purchase commitments due within one year totaling $0.9 for materials and services through contract manufacturing agreements at negotiated prices. The Company guarantees a fixed cost of certain products used in production to its China strategic partners.

Indirect Tax Contingencies

The Company accrues non-income-tax liabilities for indirect tax matters when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. In the event any losses are sustained in excess of accruals, they are charged against income. In evaluating indirect tax matters, management takes into consideration factors such as historical experience with matters of similar nature, specific facts and circumstances, and the likelihood of prevailing. Management evaluates and updates accruals as matters progress over time. It is reasonably possible that some of the matters for which accruals have not been established could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require recognizing future expenditures. Also, statutes of limitations could expire without the Company paying the taxes for matters for which accruals have been established, which could result in the recognition of future gains upon reversal of these accruals at that time. 



In August 2012, one of the Company's Brazil subsidiaries was notified of a tax assessment of approximately R$270.0, including penalties and interest, regarding certain Brazil federal indirect taxes (Industrialized Products Tax, Import Tax, Programa de Integração Social and Contribution to Social Security Financing) for 2008 and 2009. The assessment alleges improper importation of certain components into Brazil's free trade zone that would nullify certain indirect tax incentives. On September 10, 2012, the Company filed its administrative defenses with the tax authorities.

In March 2017, the administrative proceedings concluded and the assessment was reduced approximately 95 percent to a total of R$17.3 including penalties and interest as of March 2017. The Company is pursuing its remedies in the judicial sphere and management continues to believe that it has valid legal positions. In addition, this matter could negatively impact Brazil federal indirect taxes in other years that remain open under statute. It is reasonably possible that the Company could be required to pay taxes, penalties and interest related to this matter, which could be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had accrual related to the Brazil indirect tax matter of $4.0 and $4.9, respectively.

The Company has challenged the customs rulings in Thailand seeking to retroactively collect customs duties on previous imports of ATMs. Management believes that the customs authority’s attempt to retroactively assess customs duties is in contravention of World Trade Organization agreements and, accordingly, challenged the rulings. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company received a prospective ruling from the U.S. Customs Border Protection which is consistent with the Company's interpretation of the treaty in question. In August 2017, the Supreme Court of Thailand ruled in the Company's favor, finding that Customs' attempt to collect duties for importation of ATMs is improper. In addition, in August 2016 and February 2017, the tax court of appeals rendered decisions in favor of the Company related to more than half of the assessments at issue. The surviving matters remain at various stages of the appeals process and the Company will use the Supreme Court's decision in support of its position in those matters. Management remains confident that the Company has a valid legal position in these appeals. Accordingly, the Company does not have any amount accrued for this contingency.

A loss contingency is reasonably possible if it has a more than remote but less than probable chance of occurring. Although management believes the Company has valid defenses with respect to its indirect tax positions, it is reasonably possible that a loss could occur in excess of the estimated accrual. The Company estimated the aggregate risk at September 30, 2018 to be up to $125.8

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)



for its material indirect tax matters, of which $21.1 and $27.0, respectively, primarily relates to the Brazil indirect tax matter and Thailand customs matter disclosed above. The aggregate risk related to indirect taxes is adjusted as the applicable statutes of limitations expire.

Legal Contingencies

At September 30, 2018, the Company was a party to several lawsuits that were incurred in the normal course of business, which neither individually nor in the aggregate are considered material by management in relation to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. In management’s opinion, the Company's consolidated financial statements would not be materially affected by the outcome of these legal proceedings, commitments or asserted claims.


Diebold KGaA is a party to appraisal proceedings (Spruchverfahren) relating to the DPLTA entered into by Diebold KGaA and Diebold Nixdorf AG on September 26, 2016 pending at the District Court (Landgericht) of Dortmund (Germany). The appraisal proceedings were filed by minority shareholders of Diebold Nixdorf AG challenging the adequacy of both, the cash exit compensation of €55.02 per Diebold Nixdorf AG share and the annual recurring compensation of €2.82 per Diebold Nixdorf AG share offered in connection with the DPLTA. A ruling by the court would apply to all Diebold Nixdorf AG shares outstanding at the time the DPLTA became effective. While the Company believes that the compensation offered in connection with the DPLTA was fair and the claims lack merit, this matter is still at a preliminary stage and the outcome is uncertain. As a result, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from this litigation.


The Company's accounting policies derive segment results that are the same as those the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) regularly reviews and uses to make decisions, allocate resources and assess performance. The Company continually considers its operating structure and the information subject to regular review by its Chief Executive Officer, who is the CODM, to identify reportable operating segments. The Company’s operating structure is based on a number of factors that management uses to evaluate, view and run its business operations, which currently includes, but is not limited to, product, service and solution.



For additional information related to the Company's revenue sources, refer to note 2. In addition to the considerations mentioned above regarding the CODM, the Company has assessed several factors in disaggregating revenue which include the information

disclosed in this report and other disaggregated revenue information provided in investor presentations and board of director presentations.




Net non-routine expense consists of items that the Company has determined are non-routine in nature and not allocated to the reportable operating segments. Net non-routine expense of $152.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $109.3, acquisition integration expenses of $10.3 primarily within selling and administrative expense and purchase accounting pre-tax charges for amortization of acquired intangibles of $28.2. Net non-routine expense of $322.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was due to the goodwill impairment charge of $199.3 and acquisition integration expenses of $40.0, primarily within selling and administrative expense, and purchase accounting pre-tax charges for amortization of acquired intangibles of $88.7. 

Net non-routine expense of $72.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to acquisition and divestiture related costs inclusive of integration expenses of $19.8 primarily within selling and administrative expense and purchase accounting pretax charges, which included deferred revenue of $9.7 and $34.9 in amortization of acquired intangibles. Net non-routine expense of $206.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to legal, acquisition and divestiture related costs of $16.1 inclusive of the mark-to-market impact on Diebold Nixdorf AG stock options and integration expenses of $54.8 primarily

additional product volume in Mexico, Ecuador and Canada as well as additional professional services volume in North America and software license volume in Brazil.


Gross Profit



Services gross margin was relatively flat in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and was favorably impacted by lower restructuring charges of $9.9 and $24.7 in the three and the nine months ended, respectively. Lower non-routine charges of $5.1 and $14.3 in the three and nine months ended, respectively, were primarily related to lower purchase accounting adjustments inclusive of amortization and prior-year quarter deferred revenue. Excluding restructuring and non-routine charges, services gross margin decreased in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 by 1.9 and 2.4 percent, respectively. The three and nine months ended were adversely impacted by an unfavorable banking services mix in North America and higher non-recurring services cost in Brazil banking, primarily in the nine-month period. Additionally, both the three and nine months ended included unfavorable banking customer and services mix in Eurasia, negatively impacting gross margin.

Product gross margin decreased 1.3 percent in the three months ended and was relatively flat in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The three months ended September 30, 2018 was unfavorably impacted by higher restructuring charges of $1.8 while both the three and the nine months ended were favorably impacted by lower non-routine charges of $10.0 and $29.5, respectively. Lower non-routine charges in both the three and nine months ended included decreased Purchase Accounting Adjustments of amortization and prior-year deferred revenue of $10.4 and $24.2 while the nine months ended also benefited $3.7 from the Brazil indirect tax accrual reversal in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding restructuring and non-routine charges, product gross margin decreased 3.1 and 2.3 percent in the three and nine months ended, respectively, primarily as a result of unfavorable banking and retail customer mix in the Americas as well as supply chain delays in the first half of 2018 and the corresponding expedited freight cost.

Software gross margin decreased 5.6 and 3.2 percent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. Restructuring charges were higher by $1.7 and $2.6 in the three and nine months ended, respectively, while non-routine charge were lower by $1.4 and $8.3 in the three and nine months ended, respectively, primarily due to decreased Purchase Accounting Adjustments related to amortization. Excluding restructuring and non-routine charges, software gross margin decreased 6.1 and 5.1 percent in the three and nine months ended, respectively, primarily due to lower margin Latin America licenses net sales. Additionally, the nine months ended was adversely impacted from lower margin professional services in Eurasia.

Operating Expenses




Selling and administrative expense in the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $7.4 including higher incremental restructuring of $25.9 and lower non-routine charges of $8.4. Excluding the impact of restructuring, non-routine charges and a net $4.0 favorable currency impact, mostly related to the Brazil real and euro, selling and administrative expense was $6.1 lower, primarily from lower incentive compensation related to the Company’s annual incentive program (AIP) and initial benefits of the DN Now plan. Selling and administrative expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased $28.7 including higher incremental restructuring of $19.5 and lower non-routine charges of $22.7. Excluding the impact of restructuring and non-routine charges and a net favorable currency impact of $15.1, due to the euro and Brazil real, selling and administrative expense was lower $40.6, primarily from cost reduction initiatives across the Company related to restructuring programs and decreased AIP cost as well as a $4.5 benefit from the mark-to-market adjustment of the legacy Wincor Nixdorf stock option program. The decrease in the nine months ended was partially offset by the retail segment from increased investment in the new North America retail sales organization.

Non-routine cost in selling and administrative expense of $35.3 and $43.7 were included in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The primary components of the non-routine expenses in the third quarter of 2018 pertained to purchase accounting adjustments of $21.7 related to intangible asset amortization, integration cost totaling $9.3 and legal and consulting cost of $4.3. Selling and administrative expense included restructuring charges of $28.6 and $2.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily due to the workforce alignment actions under the DN Now plan. Non-routine cost in selling and administrative expense of $109.9 and $132.5 were included in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The primary components of the non-routine expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 pertained to purchase accounting adjustments of $67.8 related to intangible asset amortization, integration cost totaling $36.8 and legal and consulting cost of $5.1. Selling and administrative expense included restructuring charges of $33.0 and $13.5 in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Research, development and engineering expense in the three months ended September 30, 2018 was relatively flat excluding higher restructuring of $1.4. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, research, development and engineering expense included an unfavorable currency impact of $5.3. Excluding the impact of currency, research, development and engineering expense in the nine months ended was flat, primarily from lower AIP cost which was mostly offset by increased restructuring of $2.0.

As a result of certain impairment triggering events, the Company performed an impairment test of goodwill for its four reporting units during the third quarter of 2018. Based on the results of the impairment testing, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $109.3 related to the Eurasia Banking, EMEA Retail and Rest of World Retail reporting units during the third quarter of 2018. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company performed an impairment test of goodwill for all of its LoB reporting units due to the change in its reportable operating segments which resulted in a $90.0 non-cash impairment loss. The nine months ended September 30, 2018 recorded impairment of $199.3, related to the impairment of goodwill in the second and third quarters, compared to $3.1 in the same prior year period related to information technology transformation and integration activities.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations as of September 30, 2018

DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES



No material gain or loss on assets was recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2018. The gain on sale of assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily related to a gain on sale of buildings in North America of $4.8, the liquidation of the Barbados operating entity of $3.3 and gain related to a certain China investment. This gain on sale of assets was partially offset by the loss pertaining to a settlement of certain open matters related to an Americas divestiture in the second quarter of 2018.

Operating expense as a percent of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased 10.3 percent to 32.4 percent compared to the same period in 2017 primarily related the non-cash impairment losses and higher restructuring cost. The nine months ended increased to 29.7 percent compared to 24.0 percent in the same period in 2017 primarily related to the non-cash impairment losses recorded during the second quarter and third quarter of 2018.

Operating Profit



The operating loss increased in the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due primarily to a non-cash goodwill impairment loss along with lower gross profit in all business lines combined with increased restructuring expense. The operating loss increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due primarily to the goodwill impairment in the second and third quarters of 2018 and lower product gross profit in line with decreased volume, partially offset by favorable selling and administrative expense attributable to cost saving initiatives.

Other Income (Expense)



Interest income in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased, compared with the same periods in 2017, primarily as a result of overall lower average balances as well as lower rates on short term investments and repatriation of cash in Brazil. Interest expense in both the three and nine months was higher compared to the same prior-year periods due to higher domestic interest rates and the acquisition of the additional $650.0 of Term Loan A-1 Facility debt with higher incremental interest rates and related fee amortization. Miscellaneous net, increased in the three months ended due primarily to increased income from the strategic alliances in China while the nine months ended was unfavorably impacted by higher cost and lower benefits associated with the company owned life insurance.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of 

Financial Condition and Results of Operations as of September 30, 2018

DIEBOLD NIXDORF, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES



Net Income (Loss)



The loss before taxes and net loss increased primarily due to the reasons described above. Net loss was also impacted by the change in the income tax expense (benefit).

The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Company applied the guidance in SAB 118 when accounting for the enactment date effects of the Tax Act. As of September 30, 2018, the Company has not completed the accounting for all the tax effects of the Tax Act. However, upon further analysis of certain aspects of the Tax Act and refinements to the Company’s calculations, the Company has increased the provisional estimate relating to deemed repatriation transition tax (transition tax) by $46.8. This increase in the provisional estimate has been included as a discrete item in the interim period ended September 30, 2018. The Company will continue to refine the provision estimate over the one-year measurement period ending December 31, 2018 which will include the period in which the Company filed its U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return. The final impacts of the Tax Act may differ materially as additional guidance and information becomes available and the U.S. federal tax filing, including transition tax, is complete.

The effective tax rate on the loss before taxes was (26.5) percent for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and (9.3) percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The expense on the loss for the three months ended and nine months ended was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge, the impacts of the Tax Act and the higher interest expense burden resulting from the debt restructuring. More specifically, the expense on the loss reflects refinement of the transition tax, the impacts related to GILTI and the business interest deduction limitation which, as a result of the Company’s debt restructuring activities during the quarter, required a full valuation allowance on the current year nondeductible business interest expense. In addition, the benefit on the losses for the nine months is reduced by the goodwill impairment charge, which for tax purposes is primarily nondeductible, of $109.3 and $90.0 incurred in the third and second quarter, respectively. The effective tax rate could vary in future periods based on the Company’s earnings before taxes and clarification around the Tax Act.

The effective tax rate on the loss before taxes was 3.0 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 36.2 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The tax for the three months ended September 30, 2017 reflects an unfavorable adjustment relating to year-to-date changes in the Company’s valuation allowance as well as higher than anticipated losses incurred in jurisdictions with a full valuation allowance throughout the period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, the overall reduction in the tax benefit was offset by the repatriation of foreign earnings and the associated recognition of foreign tax credits as well as favorable discrete items associated with the release of uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and reductions in the Company’s deferred tax liability relating to undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings.

Segment Net Sales and Operating Profit Summary



In the three months ended September 30, 2018, Eurasia Banking net sales decreased $26.8 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $11.5 mainly related to the euro. Net sales in the prior-year quarter were adversely impacted $5.8 related to Deferred Revenue Adjustments. Excluding currency and Deferred Revenue Adjustments, net sales decreased $21.1 due primarily to India from a roll off of a low-margin maintenance services contract with a particular customer. Additionally, lower product volume primarily in AP was partially offset by increased unit replacements in Germany related to Windows 10 migrations. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, Eurasia Banking net sales decreased $65.7 including a net favorable currency impact of $61.7 to the euro. Net sales in the prior-year were adversely impacted $18.3, including a net favorable currency impact of $1.4, related to Deferred Revenue Adjustments. Excluding currency and Deferred Revenue Adjustments, net sales decreased $147.1 due to lower product volume in various countries throughout the segment related to fewer product deployments and projects, particularly in Turkey, Indonesia, Australia and the Middle East, in addition to decreased services in India as a result of a maintenance contract roll off with a particular customer. These decreases were partially offset by increased unit replacements in Germany related to Windows 10 migrations. 

Segment operating profit increased $3.2 in the three months and decreased $11.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the prior-year same periods. The three months ended operating profit increased primarily due to lower operating expense from lower AIP cost and the workforce alignment actions under the DN Now plan as well as higher software volume and associated profit. The increase was partially offset by lower services and product gross profit from decreased service base in AP and unfavorable services customer and solution mix in EMEA as well as unfavorable solutions mix in the Eurasia non-core business. The nine months ended was unfavorably impacted by lower gross profit attributable to lower product volume and service base loss in AP, as well as lower product volume and unfavorable services mix in the non-core business. Decreased selling and administrative and research, development and engineering expense partially offset lower gross profit in the nine months ended from a combination of lower AIP expense and cost saving initiatives related to the restructuring programs.

Segment operating profit margin increased in the three months ended primarily as a result of lower operating expense, related to lower AIP cost and cost saving initiatives, as well as higher software gross profit, partially offset by lower services and product gross profit. The nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased compared to the prior-year same period due to decreased product and services gross profit, partially offset by favorable selling and administrative expense attributable to lower AIP cost and cost saving initiatives.


In the three months ended September 30, 2018, Americas Banking increased $5.8 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $7.9 related to the Brazil real. Excluding currency, net sales increased $13.7 from higher product volume in Brazil, Canada, U.S. national accounts and Mexico, partially offset by lower product volume in U.S. regional accounts. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, Americas Banking net sales decreased $41.9 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $13.6 related to the Brazil real. Excluding currency, net sales decreased $28.3 due to lower product volume in Brazil as well as the North America regional business, which was adversely impacted by supply chain delays in the first half of 2018. Additionally, service revenue

was impacted by lower maintenance revenue from two large customers in North America and $4.1 lower electronic security revenue in Chile due to the business divestiture in September of 2017. These declines were partially offset by additional product volume in Mexico, Ecuador and Canada as well as additional professional services volume in North America and software license volume in Brazil. 

Segment operating profit decreased $10.5 and $37.6 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. Both the three and nine months ended were adversely impacted by lower services gross profit attributable to an unfavorable customer and solution mix in North America as well as higher non-recurring services cost in Brazil banking, primarily in the nine-month period. The decreases were partially offset by a repairable service parts inventory item correcting current and prior year cost of sales resulting in a larger unfavorable impact in 2017. Product gross profit decreased in both the three and nine months ended due primarily to higher freight cost as well as lower volume impacting the nine months ended from supply chain delays in the first half of 2018. Software gross profit was lower in the three months ended due to higher cost while the nine months ended was favorable due to increased professional services activity in North America and software license volume in Brazil. Partially offsetting these declines in both the three and nine months ended, selling and marketing expense decreased from lower AIP cost and associate related cost as well as cost reduction initiatives in Brazil.

Segment operating profit margin decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior-year same periods due to higher cost resulting from non-recurring expense in Brazil and unfavorable services customer and solutions mix in North America and increased product freight expense, partially offset by lower operating expense from cost reduction initiatives in Brazil and lower AIP cost.


In the three months ended September 30, 2018, retail net sales increased $17.3 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $6.7 mainly related to the euro. Prior year net sales were adversely impacted $3.9 related to Deferred Revenue Adjustments. Excluding currency and Deferred Revenue Adjustments, net sales increased $20.1 due to a large North America kiosk project as well as higher POS activity in Spain. These increases were partially offset by lower POS volume in Germany. In the nine months ended September 30, 2018, retail net sales increased $37.0 including a favorable net currency impact of $46.8 mostly related to the euro. Prior year net sales were adversely impacted $12.2, including a net favorable currency impact of $1.0, related to Deferred Revenue Adjustments. Excluding currency and Deferred Revenue Adjustments, net sales decreased $23.0 due to large prior year non-recurring POS and kiosk activity in Germany for multiple customers and to a lesser extent, the U.K. Additionally, the Company experienced lower product volume in the non-core business in Eurasia and Brazil. These declines were partially offset by higher product volume in France, Central Eastern Europe and Southern Europe as well as a large retail kiosk project in North America.

Segment operating profit decreased $8.1 and $34.8 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. The decrease in both the three and nine months ended was due primarily to Eurasia from lower product volume combined with an unfavorable customer mix, impacting the gross profit of both the services and software business, as well as an unfavorable product customer mix in the Americas. Additionally, the three and nine months ended were unfavorably impacted by increased operating expense in Eurasia related to research, development, engineering cost and higher selling and administrative expense from developing the North America retail sales organization, as well as lower product volume in Eurasia, unfavorably impacting gross profit from lower product activity in the current year.

Segment operating profit margin decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior-year same periods due to an unfavorable customer and solutions mix. In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2018 included higher operating expense related to the development of the retail business as well as higher research, development and engineering cost in Eurasia which negatively affected operating profit margin.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $9.3 to $194.7 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $185.4 during the same period in 2017 primarily due to incremental increase in depreciation expense offset by lower amortization expense. Share-based compensation increased $4.1 to $27.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to a change in non-substantive vesting terms of certain awards and an increased number of non-vested awards granted. The goodwill impairment was $199.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to $3.1 of other asset impairments during the same period in 2017.

Investing Activities

The maturities and purchases of investments primarily relate to short-term investment activity in Brazil. The $160.9 change was primarily due to the monetization of the Company's investment in the company owned life insurance plans and utilization of short-term investments in Brazil for cash needs across the organization.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was $196.9 and $22.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $174.2. The change was primarily due to an additional $650.0 in proceeds received from the Term Loan A-1 Facility and an increase in net borrowings of the Revolving Facility. The increase in borrowings were partially offset by $306.7 in debt repayments and higher cash distributions primarily related to the redemption of shares and cash compensation to Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders of $337.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $16.3 in the prior-year period. Refer to note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for details of the Company's cash flows related to debt borrowings and repayments.

Debt As of September 30, 2018, the Company had various international short-term uncommitted lines of credit with borrowing limits of $67.6.

Short-term uncommitted lines mature in less than one year. The amount available under the short-term uncommitted lines at September 30, 2018 was $44.1.

The Credit Agreement includes the Revolving Facility in the amount of up to $500.0 and the Term Loan A Facility in the amount of up to $230.0 as of September 30, 2018. On December 23, 2020, the Term Loan A Facility will mature and the Revolving Facility will automatically terminate. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding Revolving Facility borrowings as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was 4.38 percent and 3.63 percent, respectively, which is variable based on the LIBOR. The amount available under the Revolving Facility as of September 30, 2018 was $240.0.

The Company has $400.0 aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Notes which are and will be guaranteed by certain of the Company’s existing and future domestic subsidiaries and mature in 2024.

On August 30, 2018, the Company entered into the Sixth Amendment to its Credit Agreement. The Amendment amended the financial covenants and established a new senior secured incremental term A-1 facility in an aggregate principal amount of $650.0 and makes certain other changes to the Credit Agreement. 

The interest rate with respect to the Term Loan A-1 Facility is based on, at the Company’s option, either the ABR plus 8.25% or a eurocurrency rate plus 9.25%. The Term A-1 Facility will mature in August 2022, the fourth anniversary of the Sixth Amendment. The Term Loan A-1 Facility is subject to a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio, a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and Covenant Reset Triggers as described in the Sixth Amendment. Upon the occurrence of any Covenant Reset Trigger, the financial covenant levels will automatically revert to previous financial covenant levels in effect prior to the Sixth Amendment.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include revenue recognition, the valuation of trade, finance lease receivables, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, guarantee obligations and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, pension and post-retirement benefits and customer incentives, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors. Management monitors the economic conditions and other factors and will adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 

Management believes there have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to the items that the Company disclosed as its critical accounting policies and estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company operates in Argentina through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Diebold Argentina, S.A. The Argentina operations represent less than one percent of the Company's total assets and total net sales as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. As of June 30, 2018, the Company concluded that the Argentina financial results was measured using the U.S. dollar as its functional currency in the third quarter of 2018 because its economy is considered highly inflationary. The operating environment in Argentina continues to present business challenges, including continuing devaluation of Argentina’s currency and high inflation.

The Company is closely monitoring developments in Argentina and intends to take steps to mitigate adverse conditions, but there can be no assurances that these actions will be able to mitigate these conditions as they may occur.

FORM 10-Q as of September 30, 2018


On August 15, 2016, the Company designated its €350.0 euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility as a net investment hedge of its investments in certain subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency in order to reduce volatility in stockholders' equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the euro with respect to the U.S. dollar. Effectiveness is assessed at least quarterly by confirming that the respective designated net investments' net equity balances at the beginning of any period collectively continues to equal or exceed the balance outstanding on the Company's euro-denominated term loan. Changes in value that are deemed effective are accumulated in AOCI. When the respective net investments are sold or substantially liquidated, the balance of the cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI will be reclassified into earnings. The net gain (loss) recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge foreign currency borrowings was $(0.5) and $4.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. On March 30, 2017, the Company de-designated €130.6 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility and on May 9, 2017, the Company designated an additional €66.8 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility as a result of its repricing described under note 11.
