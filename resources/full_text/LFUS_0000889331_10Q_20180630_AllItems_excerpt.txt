1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information 

Nature of Operations  

Littelfuse, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a global leader in circuit protection products with advancing platforms in power control and sensor technologies, serving customers in the electronics, automotive, and industrial markets. With a diverse and extensive product portfolio of fuses, semiconductors, polymers, ceramics, relays and sensors, the Company works with its customers to build safer, more reliable and more efficient products for the connected world in virtually every market that uses electrical energy, ranging across consumer electronics, IT and telecommunication applications, industrial electronics, automobiles and other transportation, and heavy industrial applications. The Company has a network of global engineering centers and labs that develop new products and product enhancements, provides customer application support and test products for safety, reliability, and regulatory compliance. 

Basis of Presentation  

The Company’s accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and disclosures normally included in the consolidated balance sheets, statements of net income and comprehensive income and cash flows prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted as permitted by such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. They have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2017, which should be read in conjunction with the disclosures therein. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and are of a normal, recurring nature. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of annual operating results. 

Revenue Recognition 

Adoption 

On December 31, 2017, the Company adopted new guidance on revenue from contracts with customers using the modified retrospective method. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue Disaggregation 




Table of Contents  


 See Note 12, Segment Information for net sales by segment and countries. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the Company satisfies its performance obligation and control of the product is transferred to the customer. The Company’s sales arrangements with customers are predominately short term in nature and generally provide for transfer of control at the time of shipment as this is the point at which title and risk of loss of the product transfers to the customer. At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the Company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer. The amount of revenue recorded reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for goods and may include adjustments for customer allowance, rebates and price adjustments. The Company’s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third-party distributors. 

The Company has elected the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 to expense commissions when incurred as the amortization period of the commission asset the Company would have otherwise recognized is less than one year. 

Revenue and Billing 

The Company generally accepts orders from customers through receipt of purchase orders or electronic data interchange based on written sales agreements and purchasing contracts. Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs, and competition. Pricing is often negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the Company’s published price lists. The customer is invoiced when the Company’s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement. As the Company’s standard payment terms are less than one year, the Company has elected the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. The Company also elected the practical expedient provided in ASC 606-10-25-18B to treat all product shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities, and therefore recognize the gross revenue associated with the contract, inclusive of any shipping and handling revenue. This is similar to the Company’s prior practice and therefore the effect of the new guidance is immaterial. 

Ship and Debit Program 

Some of the terms of the Company’s sales agreements and normal business conditions provide customers (distributors) the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced. This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a “ship and debit” program. This program allows the distributor to debit the Company for the difference between the distributors’ contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions. Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization for pricing allowances to reduce its price. When the Company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to “debit” its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price. The Company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue. 


Table of Contents  

Return to Stock  

The Company has a return to stock policy whereby certain customers, with prior authorization from Littelfuse management, can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit. The Company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity. Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns. 

Volume Rebates 

The Company offers volume based sales incentives to certain customers to encourage greater product sales. If customers achieve their specific quarterly or annual sales targets, they are entitled to rebates. The Company estimates the projected amount of rebates that will be achieved by the customer and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 


In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments-Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” which addressed certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The ASU requires the Company to recognize any changes in the fair value of certain equity investments in net income. Previously these changes were recognized in other comprehensive income ("OCI"). The Company adopted the new standard on December 31, 2017, on a modified retrospective basis, recognizing the cumulative effect as a $9.8 million increase to retained earnings. As a result of the adoption of the new standard and change in fair value of our equity investments, for the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized an unrealized gain of $2.8 million in Other (income) expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, “Revenue Recognition.” This ASU provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. The Company adopted the new standard on December 31, 2017 using the modified retrospective method, however, no adjustment to retained earnings was needed. The new guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. See the Revenue Recognition section above for further discussion. 

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, "Income Taxes” (Topic 740). This ASU update requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of many intercompany asset transfers at the transaction date. The seller and buyer will immediately recognize the current and deferred income tax consequences of an intercompany transfer of an asset other than inventory. The tax consequences were previously deferred. The Company adopted the new standard on December 31, 2017 and it did not have a material impact.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases" (Topic 842). This ASU requires lessees to recognize, on the balance sheet, assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases of greater than twelve months. The accounting by lessors will remain largely unchanged. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Adoption will require a modified retrospective transition. The Company will adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019. The Company has made progress on assessing the Company’s portfolio of leases and compiling a central repository of all active leases. We are in the process of assessing the design of the future lease process and drafting a policy to address the new standard requirements. Key lease data elements are being evaluated including developing a methodology for determining the incremental borrowing rate across all countries where we have operations. While the Company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact the new lease accounting standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company expects to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for its operating leases in the Consolidated Balance Sheet upon adoption. 

In January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") provisions of the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The guidance indicates that either accounting for deferred taxes related to GILTI inclusions or treating any taxes on GILTI inclusions as period cost are both acceptable methods subject to an accounting policy election. The Company has not yet completed its assessment and therefore has not yet elected an accounting policy. 



The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” in which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. The operating results of the acquired business are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition. 

IXYS Corporation 

On January 17, 2018, the Company acquired IXYS Corporation (“IXYS”), a global pioneer in the power semiconductor and integrated circuit markets with a focus on medium to high voltage power control semiconductors across the industrial, communications, consumer and medical markets. IXYS has a broad customer base, serving more than 3,500 customers through its direct sales force and global distribution partners. The acquisition of IXYS is expected to accelerate the Company’s growth across the power control market driven by IXYS’s extensive power semiconductor portfolio and technology expertise. With IXYS, the Company will be able to diversify and expand its presence within industrial electronics markets, leveraging the strong IXYS industrial OEM customer base. The Company also expects to increase long-term penetration of its power semiconductor portfolio in automotive markets, expanding its global content per vehicle. 


Table of Contents  


Based on the $207.5 per share opening price of Littelfuse common stock on January 17, 2018, the consideration IXYS stockholders received in exchange of their IXYS common stock in the acquisition had a value of $814.8 million comprised of $380.6 million of cash and $434.2 million of Littelfuse stock. In addition to the consideration transferred related to IXYS common stock, the value of consideration transferred, and included in the purchase price, related to IXYS stock options that were converted to Littelfuse stock options, or cash settled, had a value of $41.7 million. As a result, total consideration was valued at $856.5 million. 

The total purchase price of $856.5 million has been allocated, on a preliminary basis, to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as of the completion of the acquisition, based on preliminary estimated fair values. The purchase price allocation is preliminary because the evaluations necessary to assess the fair values of the net assets acquired are still in process. The primary areas that are not yet finalized relate to the completion of the valuations of certain acquired income tax assets and liabilities, including the impact of the adoption of the Tax Act. As a result, these allocations are subject to change during the purchase price allocation period as the valuations are finalized. 



Included in IXYS’s current assets, net was approximately $49.1 million of receivables. All IXYS goodwill, other assets and liabilities were recorded in the Electronics segment and primarily reflected in the Americas and European geographic areas. The goodwill resulting from this acquisition consists largely of the Company’s expected future product sales and synergies from combining IXYS’s products and technology with the Company’s existing electronics product portfolio. Goodwill resulting from the IXYS acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 

Included in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 are net sales of approximately $100.2 million and $186.5 million, respectively and a loss before income taxes of $13.9 million and $31.7 million, respectively since the January 17, 2018 acquisition of IXYS. The Company recognized approximately $1.6 million and $7.5 million of stock compensation expense related to IXYS stock options converted to Littelfuse stock options during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, of which $4.5 million was recognized immediately as it related to prior services periods. 


Table of Contents  

As required by purchase accounting rules, the Company recorded a $36.9 million step-up of inventory to its fair value as of the acquisition date based on the preliminary valuation. The step-up was amortized as a non-cash charge to cost of goods sold during the first and second quarters of 2018, as the acquired inventory was sold, and reflected as other non-segment costs. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized a charge of $19.0 million and $36.9 million, respectively, for the amortization of this fair value inventory step-up. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company incurred approximately $0.8 million and $11.0 million, respectively, of legal and professional fees related to this acquisition which were primarily recognized as selling, general, and administrative expenses. These costs were reflected as other non-segment costs. 


U.S. Sensor  

On July 7, 2017, the Company acquired the assets of U.S. Sensor Corporation (“U.S. Sensor”). The acquisition purchase price of $24.3 million, net of the finalization of an income tax gross up which was settled in the fourth quarter of 2017, was funded with available cash. The acquired business expands the Company’s existing sensor portfolio in several key electronics and industrial end markets. U.S. Sensor manufactures a variety of high quality negative temperature coefficient thermistors as well as thermistor probes and assemblies. Product lines also include thin film platinum resistance temperature detectors (“RTDs”) and RTD assemblies. 



Included in U.S. Sensor’s current assets, net was approximately $1.5 million of receivables. All U.S. Sensor goodwill, other assets and liabilities were recorded in the Electronics segment and reflected in the United States geographic area. The goodwill resulting from this acquisition consists largely of the Company’s expected future product sales and synergies from combining U.S. Sensor’s products and technology with the Company’s existing electronics product portfolio. Goodwill for the above acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 

As required by purchase accounting rules, the Company recorded a $1.6 million step-up of inventory to its fair value as of the acquisition date based on the preliminary valuation. The step-up was amortized as a non-cash charge to cost of goods sold during the third quarter of 2017, as the acquired inventory was sold, and reflected as other non-segment costs.

Monolith  

In December 2015, the Company invested $3.5 million in the preferred stock of Monolith Semiconductor Inc. (“Monolith”), a U.S. start-up Company developing silicon carbide technology, which represented approximately 12% of the common stock of Monolith on an as-converted basis. The Company accounted for its investment in Monolith under the cost method with any changes in value recorded in other comprehensive income. The value of the Monolith investment was $3.5 million at December 31, 2016. 

On February 28, 2017, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement between the Company and the stockholders of Monolith (“Securities Purchase Agreement”) and conditioned on Monolith achieving a product development milestone and other provisions, the Company acquired 62% of the outstanding common stock of Monolith for $15 million. The Securities Purchase Agreement includes provisions whereby the Company will acquire the remaining outstanding stock of Monolith (“non-controlling interest”) at a time or times based on Monolith meeting certain technical and sales targets. During the first quarter of 2018, Monolith met the next set of technical and sales targets. As a result, and pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, in April 2018 the Company acquired an additional 19% of the outstanding common stock of Monolith for $5 million, of which $4 million was paid to the stockholders of Monolith. Consideration for the purchase of the remaining 19% outstanding common stock will be either $0.5 million or $5 million, based on Monolith meeting the remaining technical and sales targets, and will be paid no later than June 30, 2019. 

The additional investment, in the first quarter of 2017, resulted in the Company gaining control of Monolith and was accounted for as a step-acquisition with the fair value of the original investment immediately before the acquisition estimated to be approximately $3.5 million. As the fair value of the investment immediately prior to the transaction equaled the carrying value, there was no impact on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Net Income. As the Securities Purchase Agreement includes an obligation of the Company to mandatorily redeem the non-controlling interest for cash, the fair value of the non-controlling interest was recognized as a liability on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The original investment of $3.5 million, additional cash consideration of $14.2 million (net of cash acquired), and the non-cash consideration of the fair value of the commitment to purchase the non-controlling interest of $9.0 million resulted in a purchase price of $26.7 million. Changes in the fair value of the non-controlling interest are recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Net Income. 

Commencing March 1, 2017, Monolith was reflected as a consolidated subsidiary within the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Had the acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2017, the impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations would not have been material. 



Included in Monolith’s current assets, net was approximately $0.7 million of receivables. All Monolith goodwill, other assets and liabilities were recorded in the Electronics segment and reflected in the United States geographic area. The goodwill resulting from this acquisition consists largely of the Company’s expected future product sales and synergies from combining Monolith’s products and technology with the Company’s existing electronics product portfolio. Goodwill for the above acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Pro Forma Results 

The following table summarizes, on a pro forma basis, the combined results of operations of the Company and IXYS as though the acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2017. The Company has not included pro forma results of operations for U.S. Sensor or Monolith as these results were not material to the Company. The pro forma amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of either the actual consolidated results had the IXYS acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2017 or of future consolidated operating results. 





   (a) The amortization adjustment for the six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily reflects the reduction of amortization expense in the period related to the Order backlog intangible asset. The Order backlog has a useful life of twelve months and will be fully amortized in the fiscal 2017 pro forma results. The amortization adjustment for the three and six months ended July 1, 2017 reflects incremental amortization resulting for the measurement of intangibles at their fair values.  

      (b)   The transaction cost adjustments reflect the reversal of certain bank and attorney fees from the six months ended June 30, 2018 and recognition of those fees during the six months ended July 1, 2017.    


Table of Contents  

      (c)   The amortization of inventory step-up adjustment reflects the reversal of the amount recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and the recognition of the full amortization during the six months end July 1, 2017. The inventory step-up was amortized over five months as the inventory is sold.    

      (d)   The stock compensation adjustment reflects the reversal of the portion of stock compensation for IXYS stock options that were converted to Littelfuse stock options and expensed immediately during the six months ended June 30, 2018. The adjustment for the six months ended July 1, 2017 reflect the incremental stock compensation for the converted stock options.    

      (e)   The interest expense adjustment reflects incremental interest expense related to the financing of the transaction.    




4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 









Table of Contents  

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, the Company recorded amortization expense of $13.4 million and $6.2 million and $25.4 million and $12.1 million, respectively for intangible assets with definite lives. 







On March 4, 2016, the Company entered into a five-year credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with a group of lenders for up to $700.0 million. The Credit Agreement consisted of an unsecured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) of $575.0 million and an unsecured term loan credit facility (“Term Loan”) of up to $125.0 million. In addition, the Company had the ability, from time to time, to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan by up to an additional $150.0 million, in the aggregate, in each case in minimum increments of $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions and the agreement of participating lenders. 

On October 13, 2017, the Company amended the Credit Agreement to increase the Revolving Credit Facility from $575.0 million to $700.0 million and increase the Term Loan from $125.0 million to $200.0 million and to extend the expiration date from March 4, 2021 to October 13, 2022. The Credit Agreement also includes the option for the Company to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan by up to an additional $300.0 million, in the aggregate, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. Term Loans may be made in up to two advances. The first advance of $125.0 million occurred on October 13, 2017 and the second advance of $75.0 million occurred on January 16, 2018. For the Term Loan, the Company is required to make quarterly principal payments of 1.25% of the original term loan ($2.5 million with the second advance on January 16, 2018) through maturity, with the remaining balance due on October 13, 2022. In addition to the quarterly principal payments, the Company paid $35.0 million of principal on the term loan during the three months ended June 30, 2018. 


Table of Contents  

Outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either LIBOR, fixed for interest periods of one, two, three or six-month periods, plus 1.00% to 2.00%, or at the bank’s Base Rate, as defined, plus 0.00% to 1.00%, based upon the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined. The Company is also required to pay commitment fees on unused portions of the credit agreement ranging from 0.15% to 0.25%, based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement. The credit agreement includes representations, covenants and events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature. The effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the credit facility was 3.59% at June 30, 2018. 

As of June 30, 2018, the Company had $0.1 million outstanding in letters of credit and had available $699.9 million of borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. At June 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. 

Senior Notes 

On December 8, 2016, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold €212 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in two series. The funding date for the Euro denominated senior notes occurred on December 8, 2016 for €117 million in aggregate amount of 1.14% Senior Notes, Series A, due December 8, 2023 (“Euro Senior Notes, Series A due 2023”), and €95 million in aggregate amount of 1.83% Senior Notes, Series B due December 8, 2028 (“Euro Senior Notes, Series B due 2028”) (together, the “Euro Senior Notes”). Interest on the Euro Senior Notes is payable semiannually on June 8 and December 8, commencing June 8, 2017. 

On December 8, 2016, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold $125 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in two series. On February 15, 2017, $25 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.03% Senior Notes, Series A, due February 15, 2022 (“U.S. Senior Notes, Series A due 2022”), and $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.74% Senior Notes, Series B, due February 15, 2027 (“U.S. Senior Notes, Series B due 2027”) (together, the “U.S. Senior Notes due 2022 and 2027”) were funded. Interest on the U.S. Senior Notes due 2022 and 2027 is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15, commencing August 15, 2017. 

On November 15, 2017, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company issued and sold $175 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in two series. On January 16, 2018, $50 million aggregate principal amount of 3.48% Senior Notes, Series A, due February 15, 2025 (“U.S. Senior Notes, Series A due 2025”) and $125 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.78% Senior Notes, Series B, due February 15, 2030 (“U.S. Senior Notes, Series B due 2030”) (together the “U.S. Senior Notes due 2025 and 2030” and with the Euro Senior Notes and the U.S. Senior Notes 2022 and 2027, the “Senior Notes”) were funded. Interest on the U.S. Senior Notes due 2025 and 2030 will be payable on February 15 and August 15, commencing on August 15, 2018. 

The Senior Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, or applicable state securities laws. The Senior Notes are general unsecured senior obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company. 

The Senior Notes are subject to certain customary covenants, including limitations on the Company’s ability, with certain exceptions, to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales and transactions with affiliates, to engage in any business that would substantially change the general business of the Company, and to incur liens. In addition, the Company is required to satisfy certain financial covenants and tests relating to, among other matters, interest coverage and leverage. At June 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Notes. 

The Company may redeem the Senior Notes upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of a make-whole amount to noteholders, and are required to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes at par following certain events, including a change of control.

6. Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities  


Level 1—Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; 

Level 2—Valuations based upon quoted prices for similar instruments, prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-derived valuations, all of whose significant inputs are observable, and 

Level 3—Valuations based upon one or more significant unobservable inputs. 

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value and their classification in the valuation hierarchy. 

Investments in Equity Securities 

Investments in equity securities listed on a national market or exchange are valued at the last sales price and classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy and recorded in other noncurrent assets. 

Mutual Funds 

The Company has a non-qualified Supplemental Retirement and Savings Plan which provides additional retirement benefits for certain management employees and named executive officers by allowing participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation. The Company maintains accounts for participants through which participants make investment elections. The marketable securities are classified as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy as they are maintained in mutual funds with readily determinable fair value and recorded in other noncurrent assets. 

There were no changes during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 to the Company’s valuation techniques used to measure asset and liability fair values on a recurring basis. As of June 30, 2018, and December 30, 2017, the Company did not hold any non-financial assets or liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 




Table of Contents  



In addition to the methods and assumptions used for the financial instruments recorded at fair value as discussed above, the following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of other financial instruments that are not marked to market on a recurring basis. The Company’s other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and its long-term debt. Due to their short-term maturity, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable approximate their fair values. The Company’s revolving and term loan debt facilities’ fair values approximate book value at June 30, 2018 and December 30, 2017, as the rates on these borrowings are variable in nature. 




The Company has company-sponsored defined benefit pension plans covering employees in the U.K., Germany, the Philippines, China, Japan, and France. The amount of the retirement benefits provided under the plans is based on years of service and final average pay. 



The Company expects to make approximately $2.3 million of cash contributions to its pension plans in 2018. 


Table of Contents  










The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were 19.1% and 19.2%, respectively, compared to effective tax rates for the three and six months ended July 1, 2017 of 15.2% and 16.5%, respectively. 

The effective tax rates for the 2018 periods are higher than the effective tax rates for the 2017 periods primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and the acquisition of IXYS. The effective tax rates for the 2017 periods were lower than the then applicable 35% U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to income earned in lower tax jurisdictions.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"). Among other things, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, adds base broadening provisions which limit deductions and address excessive international tax planning, imposes a one-time tax (the “Toll Charge”) on accumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and enables repatriation of earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries free of U.S. federal income tax. Other than the Toll Charge (which, except for the IXYS impact, is applicable to the Company for 2017), the provisions will generally be applicable to the Company in 2018 and beyond. 

In accordance with the guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 118, in the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company recorded a charge of $47 million as a provisional reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act, including $49 million for the Toll Charge net of $2 million for other net tax benefits. The Company did not adjust the provisional reasonable estimate in the first six months of 2018. In addition, the Company recorded a preliminary estimate of $10 million for the Toll Charge associated with IXYS as part of the IXYS acquisition purchase price allocation. This adjustment was reflected in the opening balance sheet as an increase to goodwill and other long-term liabilities. The Company is continuing to analyze the Tax Act and plans to finalize the 2017 provisional reasonable estimate within the measurement period outlined in SAB No. 118 and the IXYS Toll Charge estimate during the purchase price allocation period. The final charges may differ from the estimates if provisions of the Tax Act, and their interaction with other provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, are interpreted differently than interpretations made by the Company in determining the estimates, whether through issuance of administrative guidance, or through further review of the Tax Act by the Company and its advisors. Aside from these interpretation issues, the final charges may differ from the estimates due to refinements of accumulated non-U.S. earnings and tax pool data. 

The Company will elect to pay the 2017 (Littelfuse) and 2018 (IXYS) Toll Charges over the eight-year period prescribed by the Tax Act. The long-term portion of these Toll Charges totaling $38.5 million (which includes the 2017 Littelfuse provisional reasonable estimate and the 2018 IXYS provisional reasonable estimate, partially offset by foreign tax credits, the first annual installment payment and the anticipated second annual installment) is recorded in the Other long-term liabilities and the short-term portion of $3.4 million is recorded in the Accrued income taxes on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2018. 

The Company recognized deferred tax liabilities of $12.0 million ($11.8 million for non-U.S. taxes and $0.2 million for U.S. state taxes) as of December 30, 2017 related to taxes on certain non-U.S. earnings which are not considered to be permanently reinvested. Some of these taxes may provide a U.S. federal income tax benefit as a foreign tax credit. However, due to uncertainty in regard to the Tax Act’s provisions, no such tax benefit was recorded as of December 30, 2017, and no such tax benefit was recorded in the first six months of 2018. The Company will reconsider this provisional conclusion when it finalizes its 2017 preliminary reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act, based upon interpretations and administrative guidance as of that time. 

One of the base broadening provisions of the Tax Act is commonly referred to as the “GILTI” provisions. In accordance with guidance issued by the FASB staff, the Company has not adopted an accounting policy for GILTI. Thus, deferred taxes were computed without consideration of the possible future impact of the GILTI provisions. The Company intends to adopt an accounting policy for GILTI within the measurement period outlined in SAB 118. Although such an accounting policy has not been adopted, the Company considered GILTI when determining the current portion of income tax expense recorded for the second quarter and first six months of 2018. 

Although certain administrative guidance has been issued, the appropriate application of many provisions of the Tax Act remain uncertain. The Company used its best judgement as to the application of these provisions in determining its income tax expense for the second quarter and first half of 2018. Adjustments to income tax expense related to the first half of 2018 may be necessary if provisions of the Tax Act, and their interaction with other provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, are interpreted differently than interpretations made by the Company in determining its estimates, whether through issuance of administrative guidance, or through further review of the Tax Act by the Company and its advisors.

Sales, marketing, and research and development expenses are charged directly into each operating segment. Manufacturing, purchasing, logistics, customer service, finance, information technology, and human resources are shared functions that are allocated back to the three operating segments. The Company does not report inter-segment revenue because the operating segments do not record it. Certain expenses, determined by the CODM to be strategic in nature and not directly related to segments current results, are not allocated but identified as “Other”. Additionally, the Company does not allocate interest and other income, interest expense, or taxes to operating segments. These costs are not allocated to the segments, as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the segments. Although the CODM uses operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Except as discussed above, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for the Company as a whole.

Executive Overview 

Founded in 1927, Littelfuse is a global leader in circuit protection products with advancing platforms in power control and sensor technologies, serving customers in the electronics, automotive, and industrial markets. With a diverse and extensive product portfolio of fuses, semiconductors, polymers, ceramics, relays and sensors, the Company works with its customers to build safer, more reliable and more efficient products for the connected world in virtually every market that uses electrical energy, ranging across consumer electronics, IT and telecommunication applications, industrial electronics, automobiles and other transportation, and heavy industrial applications. 


Executive Summary 

For the second quarter of 2018, the Company recognized net sales of $459.2 million compared to $313.4 million in the second quarter of 2017 representing an increase of $145.8 million, or 46.5%. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of IXYS, which added $100.2 million in sales along with higher volume across all three segments. Net sales for Electronics increased $130.0 million, or 76.7%, primarily due to the acquisition of IXYS and strong growth across all the business units and favorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $8.0 million. Net sales for the Automotive segment increased $10.7 million, or 9.2% due to volume growth across all the segment’s business units. Net sales in the Industrial segment increased $5.1 million or 18.7% due to volume growth across all the segment’s business units. The Company recognized net income of $42.3 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $48.6 million, or $2.11 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017. The decrease in net income reflects the impact of $19.0 million of purchase accounting inventory charges, higher amortization expense of $7.2 million and foreign exchange losses of $3.2 million that were partially offset by the acquisition of IXYS and operating income increases across the Electronics and Industrial segments. Additionally, the per share results reflect an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 2.1 million resulting from the shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of IXYS. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $140.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $93.6 million for the six months ended July 1, 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflected higher earnings and favorable working capital management that more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs and higher cash taxes. 

During the second quarter of 2018, the Company announced as part of its strategic assessment and cost savings initiatives, the exit of the Custom business within the Industrial segment and the Radio Pulse business within the IXYS acquisition. The Company does not expect the exit of these businesses to have a material impact on the Company's future net sales and net earnings. The exit of the Custom business resulted in total impairment charges of $1.1 million for the tradename and real property. The exit of the Radio Pulse business resulted in restructuring charges of $2.1 million, of which $1.4 million was for severance charges and $0.7 million of other restructuring charges. The Company expects to realize future cost savings resulting from these restructuring activities. 

On July 6, 2018, the Trump administration imposed Section 301 tariffs on products that are imported into the United States where the country of origin is China. This tariff primarily impacts our Electronics segment and to a lesser extent our Automotive and Industrial segments. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on our future results of operations.

Results of Operations  

The following table summarizes the Company’s consolidated results of operations for the periods presented. The second quarter of 2018 includes $28.7 million of non-segment charges. The charges related to the IXYS acquisition total $24.4 million ($63.2 million year-to-date) and include $19.0 million ($36.9 million year-to-date) of purchase accounting inventory charges, $2.3 million ($14.1 million year-to-date) in acquisition-related and integration costs primarily related to legal, accounting and other expenses associated with the acquisition of IXYS, $3.1 million ($5.6 million year-to-date) in backlog amortization costs, stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior services periods of $4.5 million year-to-date and other charges of $2.1 million year-to-date. In addition, there were $3.2 million ($3.9 million year-to-date) of severance and other restructuring charges and $1.1 million of impairment charges ($1.1 million year-to-date) associated with the exit of the Radio Pulse and Custom businesses, respectively. 

The second quarter of 2017 includes approximately $0.3 million of non-segment charges ($1.8 million year-to-date). These were primarily attributable to acquisition-related costs primarily related to legal and integration costs associated with the Company’s acquisitions in 2016 of the ON Portfolio. 


Net Sales 

Net sales increased $145.8 million, or 46.5%, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 with increases of $100.2 million and $3.4 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, respectively. The remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher volume across all businesses in the Electronics, Automotive and Industrial segments and $8.0 million of favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. 

Net sales for the first six months of 2018 increased $278.2 million, or 46.5%, compared to the first six months of 2017 with increases of $186.5 million and $6.5 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, respectively. The remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher volume across all businesses in the Electronics, Automotive and Industrial segments and $21.1 million of favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. 

Gross Profit 

Gross profit was $169.0 million, or 36.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018, compared to $132.6 million, or 42.3% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2017. The increase in gross profit reflects the impact of the IXYS acquisition and volume growth across all segments. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the purchase accounting inventory charges of $19.0 million which negatively impacted the second quarter of 2018 gross margin by 4.1 percentage points and unfavorable mix in products from the IXYS acquisition. 

Gross profit was $318.6 million, or 36.3% of net sales, in the first six months of 2018, compared to $246.3 million, or 41.1% of net sales in the first six months of 2017. The increase in gross profit reflects the IXYS acquisition and volume growth across all segments and expense leverage across all segments. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the purchase accounting inventory charges of $36.9 million which negatively impacted the first six months of 2018 gross margin by 4.2 percentage points.

Operating Expenses 

Total operating expenses were $109.4 million, or 23.8% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $72.3 million, or 23.1% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2017. The increase in operating expenses of $37.1 million is primarily due to incremental operating expenses related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, an increase in amortization expense of $7.2 million resulting from the acquisition of IXYS, higher acquisition-related and integration costs of $2.0 million, and higher restructuring and impairment charges.  

Total operating expense for the first six months of 2018 was $221.4 million, or 25.2% of net sales, compared to $137.1 million, or 22.9% of net sales, for the first six months of 2017. The increase in operating expenses of $84.3 million is primarily due to incremental operating expenses related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, an increase in amortization expense of $13.3 million resulting from the acquisition of IXYS as well as higher acquisition-related and integration costs of $12.3 million. Total operating expenses as a percent of net sales increased from 22.9% for the first six months of 2017 to 25.2% for the first six months of 2018 primarily due to the higher amortization expense and acquisition-related and integration charges noted above. 

Operating Income 

Operating income was $59.6 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 1.1%, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $60.3 million for the second quarter of 2017. Increases in operating income across the Electronics segment were more than offset by purchase accounting inventory charges of $19.0 million, higher amortization charges of $7.2 million and higher restructuring and impairment charges of $4.3 million along with the costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the IXYS acquisition as described above. Operating margins decreased from 19.2% in the second quarter of 2017 to 13.0% in the second quarter of 2018. The purchase accounting inventory charge negatively impacted margins by 4.1% with the remaining decrease driven by the above charges partially offset by higher volume across all segments. 

Operating income for the first six months of 2018 was $97.2 million, or 11.1% of net sales, compared to $109.1 million, or 18.2% of net sales, for the first six months of 2017. The decrease in operating income is primarily due to the purchase accounting inventory charges of $36.9 million along with the costs associated with the acquisition and integration of IXYS as described above. The purchase accounting inventory charges, higher acquisition and integration charges and higher amortization expense negatively impacted margins by 4.2%, 1.3% and 0.8%, respectively. 

Income Before Income Taxes 

Income before income taxes was $52.3 million, or 11.4% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $57.4 million, or 18.3% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2017. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before income taxes was impacted by increased unfavorable foreign exchange losses of $3.8 million primarily due to fluctuations in the Euro and Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and increased interest expense of $2.5 million associated with the increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition. Additionally, partially offsetting the previously mentioned expense increases was an increase in other income of $1.9 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended July 1, 2017 primarily as a result of unrealized investment gains associated with our equity investments. 

Income before income taxes for the first six months of 2018 was $97.0 million, or 11.1% of net sales compared to $104.8 million, or 17.5% of net sales, for the first six months of 2017. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above income before income taxes was favorably impacted by foreign exchange gains of $5.2 million and increases in other income of $3.7 million primarily due to unrealized investment gains in our equity investments partially offset by higher interest expense of $4.8 million resulting from increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense was $10.0 million, or an effective tax rate of 19.1%, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $8.7 million, or an effective tax rate of 15.2%, for the second quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was lower than the then applicable 35% U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to income earned in lower tax jurisdictions. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was higher than the effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and the acquisition of IXYS.

Income tax expense for the first six months of 2018 was $18.6 million, or an effective tax rate of 19.2%, compared to income tax expense of $17.3 million, or an effective tax rate of 16.5%, for the first six months of 2017. The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2017 was lower than the then applicable 35% U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to income earned in lower tax jurisdictions. The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2018 was higher than the effective tax rate for the first six months of 2017 primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and the acquisition of IXYS.

Dividends 

During July 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a 16% increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.37 to $0.43. This equates to an annualized dividend of $1.72 per share. 

Cash Flow Overview 


Cash Flow from Operating Activities 

Operating cash inflows are largely attributable to sales of the Company’s products. Operating cash outflows are largely attributable to recurring expenditures for raw materials, labor, rent, interest, taxes and other operating activities. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $140.9 million for the first six months of 2018, compared to $93.6 million during the six months ended July 1, 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher earnings and favorable working capital management that more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs and higher cash taxes.  

Cash Flow from Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was $350.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $36.1 million during the six months ended July 1, 2017. Net cash used for the acquisition of IXYS was $306.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to net cash used for the acquisition of a majority stake in Monolith of $14.2 million for the six months ended July 1, 2017. Capital expenditures were $40.3 million, representing an increase of $12.0 million compared to 2017.  

Cash Flow from Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $196.2 million for the six months ended 2018 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $10.1 million for the six months ended 2017. The Company had $310.0 million of proceeds from the credit facility, term loan and senior notes payable partially offset by payments $100.0 million on the credit facility and term loan during the first six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $125.0 million of proceeds from the senior notes payable and $115.6 million of payments on the credit facility and term loan during the six months ended July 1, 2017. Additionally, dividends paid increased $3.5 million from $15.0 million in 2017 to $18.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. 

Share Repurchase Program 

The Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock under a program for the period May 1, 2018 to April 30, 2019 (“Share Repurchase Program”). The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the second quarter of 2018.

Specifically, the Company was not liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties, the Company was not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity and the Company did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets. The Company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures. The assumptions, estimates, and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends, and other factors the Company believes are relevant at the time it prepares the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 


Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases" (Topic 842). This ASU requires lessees to recognize, on the balance sheet, assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases of greater than twelve months. The accounting by lessors will remain largely unchanged. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Adoption will require a modified retrospective transition. The Company will adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019. The Company has made progress on assessing the Company’s portfolio of leases and compiling a central repository of all active leases. We are in the process of assessing the design of the future lease process and drafting a policy to address the new standard requirements. Key lease data elements are being evaluated including developing a methodology for determining the incremental borrowing rate across all countries where we have operations. While the Company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact the new lease accounting standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company expects to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for its operating leases in the Consolidated Balance Sheet upon adoption. 

In January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") provisions of the Tax Act. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The guidance indicates that either accounting for deferred taxes related to GILTI inclusions or treating any taxes on GILTI inclusions as period cost are both acceptable methods subject to an accounting policy election. The Company has not yet completed its assessment and therefore has not yet elected an accounting policy.
