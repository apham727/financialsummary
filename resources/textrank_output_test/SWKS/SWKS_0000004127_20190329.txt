We generated net revenue of $810.4 million for the three months ended March 29, 2019, a decrease of $103.0 million or 11.3%, as compared with $913.4 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 2018.
Net revenue decreased by 9.3% or $182.9 million to $1,782.4 million for the six months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with $1,965.3 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 2018.
This decrease in net revenue for the three and six months ended March 29, 2019, is primarily related to weakness in smartphone demand, partially offset by the increasing number of applications of the Internet of Things, our expanding analog product portfolio supporting new vertical markets including automotive, consumer, industrial, infrastructure, medical, and military, and our success in capturing a higher share of the increasing radio frequency and analog content per device as smartphone models continue to evolve.
The $110.1 million decrease in gross profit for the six months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, was primarily the result of lower average selling prices and lower unit volumes with a gross profit impact of $298.7 million.
The increase in research and development expenses for the three and six months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with the corresponding periods in fiscal 2018, was primarily related to an increase in employee-related compensation expense and product development–related expenses.
