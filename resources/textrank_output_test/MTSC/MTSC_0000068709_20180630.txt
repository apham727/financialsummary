The aforementioned revenue standards and amendments are required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2019.
The aforementioned lease standards and amendments are required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2020.
For sales that include installation services, warranty obligations generally extend for a period of 12 to 24 months from the date of either shipment or acceptance based on the contract terms.
We record general warranty provisions based on an estimated warranty expense percentage applied to current period revenue.
Assets held under capital leases, consisting of machinery and equipment, are recorded at the present value of minimum lease payments and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset or the lease term.
Amortization of assets held as capital leases is included in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1 Based on observable market transactions of spot currency rates and forward currency rates on equivalently-termed instruments.
Carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities are equal to the fair value.
Carrying amount of the financial asset is equal to the fair value.
These assets were initially measured and recognized at amounts equal to the fair value determined as of the date of acquisition or purchase subject to changes in value only for foreign currency translation.
Periodically, these assets are tested for impairment by comparing their respective carrying values to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or asset group in which they reside.
In the event any of these assets were to become impaired, we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit, impaired asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.
Fair value measurements of the reporting units associated with our goodwill balances and our indefinite-lived intangible assets are estimated at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year for purposes of impairment testing if a quantitative analysis is performed.
Certain financial instruments are not measured at fair value but are recorded at carrying amounts approximating fair value based on their short-term nature or variable interest rate.
1 The fair value of the 8.75% tangible equity units (TEUs) is based on the most recently quoted price for the outstanding securities, adjusted for any known significant deviations in value.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the impact of the Tax Act. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we initiated a series of Test workforce reductions and facility closures intended to increase organizational effectiveness, gain manufacturing efficiencies and provide cost savings that can be reinvested in our growth initiatives.
The following table compares results of operations, separately identifying the estimated impact of currency translation and restructuring costs incurred in fiscal year 2018.
Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased 0.5% primarily driven by growth in our Sensors business and the favorable impact of currency translation, partially offset by lower Test revenue.
Current year Test revenue was also impacted by higher custom project backlog which takes longer to convert to revenue, partially offset by continued growth in the Test materials sector.
Revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 declined 1.1% primarily driven by lower Test revenue, partially offset by growth in our Sensors business and the favorable impact of currency translation.
Current year Test revenue was also impacted by higher custom project backlog which takes longer to convert to revenue, partially offset by continued growth in the Test materials sector.
Gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased 1.0% primarily driven by higher Sensors revenue volume, partially offset by lower Test revenue volume.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, the prior year PCB acquisition inventory adjustment, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, gross profit declined 1.2% and the gross margin rate increased 0.3 percentage points.
Gross profit for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 increased 0.5% primarily driven by increased Sensors revenue volume and the prior year impact of the PCB acquisition inventory adjustment of $7,975, partially offset by reduced Test revenue volume.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, the prior year PCB acquisition inventory adjustment, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, gross profit declined 5.4% and the gross margin rate declined 0.5 percentage points.

A hypothetical 10% appreciation or depreciation in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, assuming all other variables are held constant, would result in an increase or decrease in revenue of approximately $22,719 for the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
