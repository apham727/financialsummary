Accordingly, certain information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements are not included herein.
The December 31, 2018 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet is derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.
The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019 (as amended on September 20, 2019, the “2018 Form 10-K”).
Our more significant estimates include the excess and obsolete inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination of the deferred and accrued revenue components of multiple performance obligations sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred and accrued revenue, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company revised the methodology used in estimating its excess and obsolete inventory reserves.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company determined that there was an immaterial misstatement of its excess and obsolete inventory reserves in its previously issued annual and interim financial statements.
The Company corrected this misstatement by recognizing a $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment during the three months ended June 30, 2019, which increased its excess and obsolete inventory reserves and cost of goods sold for the period.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the out-of-period adjustment was a cumulative $0.2 million reduction in the Company’s excess and obsolete inventory reserves and cost of goods sold.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires an entity to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity’s leasing arrangements.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which clarified certain aspects of ASU 2016-02, as well as ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, which provided for an optional transition method allowing for the application of the legacy lease guidance, Leases (Topic 840), including its disclosure requirements, for the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption.
In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842) Codification Improvements, which removed the requirement for an entity to disclose in the interim periods after adoption, the effect of the change on income from continuing operations, net income, any other affected financial statement line item, and any affected per share amount.
As a lessor, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income or Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Contingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date, the payments of which were dependent upon SmartRG achieving future revenue, EBIT or customer purchase order milestones during the first half of 2019.
We recorded goodwill of $3.5 million as a result of this acquisition, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively, related to the SmartRG acquisition.
No acquisition-related expenses were incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 related to the SmartRG acquisition.

See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further information regarding the Company’s segments and revenue categories.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company changed the manner in which it estimates its excess and obsolete inventory reserves.
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 58.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 59.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and decreased from 61.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 58.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Network Solutions segment cost of sales, as a percentage of that segment’s sales, increased from 57.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 60.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and decreased from 61.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 57.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in volume, a regional revenue shift, changes in customer and product mix and a decrease in labor expense due to a restructuring program initiated in the first quarter of 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 0.5% from $30.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to $30.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and increased 3.4% from $96.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to $99.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 21.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to 27.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and decreased from 24.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 24.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Research and development expenses increased 6.6% from $29.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 to $31.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and increased 2.2% from $93.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to $95.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Although these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit-worthiness of these financial institutions, and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.
As of September 30, 2019, $93.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out by management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Management determined that controls were not effectively designed, documented, and maintained to verify that the existence of all inventories subject to our cycle count program were included and counted at the frequency required under the Company’s internal policies, and that the key reports and related data used to monitor the results of this program were not validated to ensure completeness and accuracy.
