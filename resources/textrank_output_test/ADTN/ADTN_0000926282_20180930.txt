In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract.
Specifically, ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementations costs incurred to develop or obtain internal use software.
These ASUs primarily affected our network implementation service revenue performance obligations and contract costs.
We are using the “output method” to measure network implementation services progress, which 1) accelerates revenue recognition for certain performance obligations related to service revenue arrangements that were previously deferred until customer acceptance and 2) requires capitalization and amortization of the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as described below.
We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which is subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties.
The bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million represents the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired over the cash paid.
The transfer of these assets to ADTRAN, which included key customer relationships and a required assumption by ADTRAN of relatively low incremental expenses, along with the value of the technology license and OEM supply agreement, resulted in the bargain purchase gain.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively, related to this acquisition.
Revenue is measured based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied.
For transactions where there are multiple performance obligations, we account for individual products and services separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer).
The consideration, including any discounts, is allocated between separate products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices.
The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which we sell the separate products and services and are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and services in the arrangement.
Shipping fees are recorded as revenue and the related cost is included in cost of sales.
Costs of obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized over the period that the related revenue is recognized if greater than one year.
We have elected to apply the practical expedient related to the incremental costs of obtaining contracts and recognize those costs as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets is one year or less.
The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware sales and is recognized when control is transferred to our customers, which is generally when we ship the products.

As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 53.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2017 to 58.4% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, and increased from 54.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to 61.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, and services and support mix.
The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, and services and support mix, restructuring expenses and an increase in warranty replacements.
Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, increased from 50.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2017 to 57.8% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, and increased from 51.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to 61.0% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, an increase in warranty expense due to a settlement in first quarter of 2017 with a third party supplier for a defective component and purchase discounts received from a contract manufacturer in the first quarter of 2017 and restructuring expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 11.3% from $34.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2017 to $30.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, and decreased 7.5% from $104.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to $96.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in compensation and labor expense, travel expense and independent contractor expense, partially offset by an increase in restructuring expense.
