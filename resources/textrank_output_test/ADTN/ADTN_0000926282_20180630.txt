ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity's leasing arrangements.
These ASUs primarily affected our network implementation service revenue performance obligations and contract costs.
In connection with the adoption of the new revenue standard, effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs – Contracts with Customers, with respect to capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract.
The primary effect was the capitalization of certain sales commissions for our extended maintenance and support contracts in excess of one year and amortization of those costs over the period that the related revenue is recognized.
We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which is subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties.
The transfer of these assets to ADTRAN, which included key customer relationships and a required assumption by ADTRAN of relatively low incremental expenses, along with the value of the technology license and OEM supply agreement, resulted in the bargain purchase gain.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to this acquisition.
Revenue is measured based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied.Sales were $128.0 million and $248.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $184.7 million and $355.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
Our operating income margin decreased to (10.0)% and (15.9)% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, from 8.9% and 6.6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
Net income (loss) was $(7.7) million and $(18.5) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $12.4 million and $19.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
Our effective tax rate, excluding the effect of the bargain purchase gain in 2018, increased to 31.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 from 30.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and decreased to 20.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 from 27.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 54.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to 61.0% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and increased from 55.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to 63.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, increased from 51.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to 60.5% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and increased from 52.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to 62.7% in the six months ended June 30, 2018.As of June 30, 2018, $98.3 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds, commercial paper and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits.
