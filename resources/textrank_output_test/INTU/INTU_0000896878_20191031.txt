Intuit helps consumers, small businesses, and the self-employed prosper by delivering financial management and compliance products and services.
We also provide specialized tax products to accounting professionals, who are key partners that help us serve small business customers.
Our flagship brands, QuickBooks, TurboTax and Mint, help customers run their small businesses, pay employees and send invoices, separate business and personal expenses, track their money, and file income taxes.
We have included all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items, which we considered necessary for a fair presentation of our financial results for the interim periods presented.
Effective August 1, 2019, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" (ASC 842) using the modified retrospective approach, under which financial results reported in prior periods were not restated.
Funds held for customers represent cash held on behalf of our customers that is invested in cash and cash equivalents and investment-grade available-for-sale debt securities.
The purchases, sales and maturities of the investments for our funds held for customers are presented in investing activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
We present the net change in customer fund deposits in financing activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
For the three months ended October 31, 2018, we reclassified $71 million from investing activities to financing activities to conform to the current presentation, resulting in a decrease in net cash used in financing activities with a corresponding offset to net cash used in investing activities.
Results for the three months ended October 31, 2019 do not necessarily indicate the results we expect for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2020 or any other future period.
Our Consumer and Strategic Partner offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April.
We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1 to the financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019.
Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the disclosures made in the accompanying notes.
We use estimates in determining the collectibility of accounts receivable and notes receivable, the appropriate levels of various accruals including accruals for litigation contingencies, the discount rate used to calculate lease liabilities, the amount of our worldwide tax provision, and the realizability of deferred tax assets.

As part of our strategy, we also develop relationships with key partners that enable us to scale our service to consumers, small businesses and the self-employed globally, including financial institutions, enterprise platforms, educational institutions and accountants.
Our Consumer and Strategic Partner offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April.
This seasonal pattern results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively.
We expect the seasonality of our Consumer and Strategic Partner businesses to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.
Net income increased $23 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with the same quarter of fiscal 2019 due to the change in operating income described above partially offset by a decrease in excess tax benefits on share-based compensation.

Our competitors may introduce superior products and services, reduce prices, have greater technical, marketing and other resources, have greater name recognition, have larger installed bases of customers, have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers, advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services.
In addition, we may face competition from existing companies, with large established consumer user-bases and broad-based platforms, who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers, including small businesses and tax customers.
We also face competition from companies with a variety of business models, including increased competition from providers of free offerings, particularly in our tax, accounting, and payments businesses.
In order to compete, we have also introduced free offerings in several categories, but we may not be able to attract customers as effectively as competitors with different business models.
In addition, other providers of free offerings may provide features that we do not offer and customers who have formerly paid for Intuit’s products and services may elect to use our competitors’ free offerings instead.
Our consumer tax business also faces significant potential competition from the public sector, where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities proposing revenue raising strategies that involve developing and providing government tax software or other government return preparation systems at public expense.
These or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future, which may change the voluntary compliance tax system in ways that could cause us to lose customers and revenue.
Under this program, the IRS has worked with private industry to provide more than 56 million free returns since 2003, utilizing donated private sector tax software and e-filing services for low and middle income taxpayers at no cost to the government or individual users.
If the Free File Program were to be terminated and the IRS were to enter the software development and return preparation space, the federal government would become a publicly funded direct competitor of the U.S. tax services industry and of Intuit.
