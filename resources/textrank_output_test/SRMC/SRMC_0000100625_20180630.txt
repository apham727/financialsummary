The Company’s FieldServer family of protocol gateways, routers, and network explorers targets facility automation requirements, and is used by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and system integrators to enable local and remote monitoring and control of assets and facilities.
The FieldServer family of products works with the SMC Cloud portal; a cloud-based service that registers and manages FieldServer products, provides secure remote access to the local web-based applications that run on FieldServer products, and integrates with third-party applications over REST APIs. With more than 200,000 installed gateways supporting over 140 protocols such as BACnet, LonWorks, MODBUS, and XML in commercial and industrial facilities, FieldServer is the industry’s leading multi-protocol gateway brand and is delivered in a variety of form factors appropriate to the asset being interfaced.
The intellectual property in FieldServer products is embodied in the proprietary embedded software that runs on a variety of customized hardware platforms with different connectivity options such as Serial, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or cellular.
Additionally, the embedded software enables the assets or devices in the facility to securely connect to third-party clouds and to the Company’s own SMC Cloud portal.
The SMC Cloud portal is a proprietary, secure, and scalable Software-as-a-Service product and is developed and deployed using the same core technologies and providers that are used by many of the world’s leading web sites and Internet-based services.
The Company’s revenues are derived from the sale of FieldServer products, FieldServer products services, Gas Detection and Environment Control products, and Gas Detection and Environment Control products services.
The Company’s revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services.
The creditworthiness of customers is assessed prior to the Company accepting a customer’s first order.
Gas detection and environment control services consist of field service orders (technical support) and training, which are provided separately from product orders.
FieldServer services consist of orders for custom development of protocol drivers.
