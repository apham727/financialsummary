The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2017.
In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on its consolidated financial statements.
The update will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, using a modified retrospective approach.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.
ASU 2014-09 is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The Company does not currently expect significant changes in revenue recognition practices for continuing operations compared to existing GAAP.
On October 17, 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Premier Farnell Plc (“PF”), a global distributor of electronic components and related products.
Included in the gain on sale recorded upon completion of the sale were estimates for certain income taxes due on the gain and additional cash consideration expected from the Buyer related to a closing date net working capital sales price adjustment (the “closing date adjustment”).
The Company is finalizing the closing date adjustment with the Buyer as provided for in the sales agreement and has included an estimate of this amount as the principal component of the $269.2 million of prepaid and other current assets as of December 30, 2017.
The final closing date adjustment, as determined through the established process outlined in the sales agreement, may be materially different from the Company’s estimate.
The Company expects the closing date adjustment to be finalized by the end of fiscal 2018 and the income tax on the gain to be finalized during fiscal 2019.
Unrealized and realized gains or losses due to changes in fair value based upon Level 1 quoted active market prices of the Shares are recorded in “Other income (expense), net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The sales agreement includes time based contractual restrictions related to the Company’s sale of the Shares and as such, the Company entered into economic hedges to reduce the Company’s exposure to price fluctuations of the Shares during the restricted period, which fixes the net amount that the Company will realize upon the sale of the Shares.
The Company records changes in fair value related to the economic share price hedges within “Other income (expense), net”, offsetting the changes in fair value of the underlying Shares.
During the six months ended December 30, 2017, the Company sold 1.4 million Shares, the net proceeds of which have been included in “Cash flows from investing activities – discontinued operations.”
