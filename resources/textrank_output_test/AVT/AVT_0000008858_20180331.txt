This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of PF, which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and an overall increase in sales in EC as double-digit growth in the EMEA and Asia regions of EC offset a year to date decrease of 8.9% in the EC Americas region.As a result primarily of certain former manufacturing operations, Avnet has incurred and may have future liability under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing pollution and exposure to, and the handling, storage and disposal of, hazardous substances.
