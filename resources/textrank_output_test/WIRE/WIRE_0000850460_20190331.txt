The unaudited financial statements of Encore Wire Corporation (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete annual financial statements.
Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivables on the balance sheet and require payment on a short-term basis through standard payment terms.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative U.S. GAAP other than Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606),” which replaces numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, and provides companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.
The comparative information has also not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” on January 1, 2019, the Company recorded $0.7 million of right of use assets which are included in other non-current assets in the accompanying balance sheet, $0.2 million of current lease liabilities which are included in accounts payable and $0.5 million of long-term lease liabilities included in other non-current liabilities.The Company is a significant supplier of building wire for interior electrical wiring in commercial and industrial buildings, homes, apartments, and manufactured housing.
Price competition for electrical wire and cable is intense, and the Company sells its products in accordance with prevailing market prices.
Copper, a commodity product, is the principal raw material used by the Company in manufacturing its products.
Copper accounted for approximately 73.0%, 69.7%, and 65.2% of the Company’s cost of goods sold during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.
Net sales were $314.7 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $291.4 million in the first quarter of 2018.
This 8.0% increase in net sales dollars is primarily the result of a 13.5% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset somewhat by a 5.9% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 9.6% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $273.4 million, or 86.9% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2019, compared to $253.9 million, or 87.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018.
Gross profit increased to $41.3 million, or 13.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2019 from $37.5 million, or 12.9% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018.For information on the Company’s legal proceedings, see Note 8 to the Company’s financial statements included in Item 1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
