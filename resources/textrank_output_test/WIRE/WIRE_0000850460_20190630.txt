Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market.
During the first three quarters of every year, LIFO calculations are based on the inventory levels and costs at that time.
Earnings per common and common equivalent share are computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during each period.
If dilutive, the effect of stock options, treated as common stock equivalents, is calculated using the treasury stock method.
The weighted average of employee stock options excluded from the determination of diluted earnings per common and common equivalent share for the second quarter was 117,500 in 2019 and 166,500 in 2018.
The weighted average of employee stock options excluded from the determination of diluted earnings per common and common equivalent share for the six months ended June 30 was 117,500 in 2019 and 156,056 in 2018.

Net sales were $336.9 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $336.8 million in the second quarter of 2018.
The virtually identical net sales dollars are primarily the result of a 5.6% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset by a 6.1% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper and other raw material prices and product price competition.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 8.7% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $291.0 million, or 86.4% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $292.3 million, or 86.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018.

Unit volumes increased 5.6%, while the spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sales price for a pound of copper contained in finished wire decreased 0.4% in the second quarter of 2019 versus the second quarter of 2018.
The spread decreased as a result of the average sales price per pound of copper sold decreasing 6.1% while the per pound cost of raw copper purchased decreased 8.7%.
As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis and makes a monthly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO.
The Company applies the lower of cost or market (LCM) test by comparing the LIFO cost of its raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods inventories to estimated market values, which are based primarily upon the most recent quoted market price of copper and other material prices as of the end of each reporting period.
Net sales for the first six months of 2019 were $651.6 million compared to net sales of $628.2 million for the first six months of 2018.
