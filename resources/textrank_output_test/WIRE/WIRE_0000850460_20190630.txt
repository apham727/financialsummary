The unaudited financial statements of Encore Wire Corporation (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete annual financial statements.
As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” on January 1, 2019, the Company recorded $0.7 million of right of use assets which are included in other non-current assets, $0.2 million of current lease liabilities which are included in accounts payable and $0.5 million of long-term lease liabilities included in other non-current liabilities.
We will evaluate any future lease commitments in conformance with ASU No. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market.
In the second quarter of 2019, LIFO adjustments were recorded, decreasing cost of sales by $3.3 million, versus LIFO adjustments increasing cost of sales by $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2018.
Income taxes were accrued at an effective rate of 23.2% in the second quarter of 2019 versus 22.7% in the second quarter of 2018, consistent with the Company’s estimated liabilities.Copper accounted for approximately 73.0%, 69.7%, and 65.2% of the Company’s cost of goods sold during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.
The following discussion and analysis relate to factors that have affected the operating results of the Company for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
Net sales were $336.9 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $336.8 million in the second quarter of 2018.
The virtually identical net sales dollars are primarily the result of a 5.6% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset by a 6.1% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 8.7% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $291.0 million, or 86.4% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $292.3 million, or 86.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018.
Gross profit increased to $45.9 million, or 13.6% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2019 from $44.5 million, or 13.2% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018.
Unit volumes increased 5.6%, while the spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sales price for a pound of copper contained in finished wire decreased 0.4% in the second quarter of 2019 versus the second quarter of 2018.
The spread decreased as a result of the average sales price per pound of copper sold decreasing 6.1% while the per pound cost of raw copper purchased decreased 8.7%.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, decreased to 74.6% of net sales in the second quarter of 2019, from 76.4% of net sales in the second quarter of 2018.For information on the Company’s legal proceedings, see Note 8 to the Company’s financial statements included in Item 1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
