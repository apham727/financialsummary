As a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” on January 1, 2019, the Company recorded $0.7 million of right of use assets which are included in other non-current assets, $0.2 million of current lease liabilities which are included in accounts payable and $0.5 million of long-term lease liabilities included in other non-current liabilities.
We will evaluate any future lease commitments in conformance with ASU No. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),” which makes significant changes to the accounting for credit losses on financial assets and disclosures about them.
This ASU requires immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses.

Copper accounted for approximately 73.0%, 69.7%, and 65.2% of the Company’s cost of goods sold during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.
The following discussion and analysis relate to factors that have affected the operating results of the Company for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.
Net sales were $321.2 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $340.7 million in the third quarter of 2018.
The drop in net sales dollars is primarily the result of a 5.9% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire, offset slightly by a 0.2% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 4.2% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 and was a driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $278.2 million, or 86.6% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $286.2 million, or 84.0% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018.
Gross profit decreased to $43.0 million, or 13.4% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2019 from $54.5 million, or 16.0% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, increased to 74.3% of net sales in the third quarter of 2019, from 73.2% of net sales in the third quarter of 2018.
Overhead costs increased to 12.3% of net sales in the third quarter of 2019, from 10.8% of net sales in the third quarter of 2018.
As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis and makes a monthly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO.
During the third quarter of 2018, a LIFO adjustment was recorded, decreasing cost of sales by $9.1 million.
Net sales for the first nine months of 2019 were $972.7 million compared to net sales of $969.0 million for the first nine months of 2018.
This 0.4% increase in net sales is the result of a 6.0% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset by a 5.8% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 7.3% in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 and was a driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold increased to $842.5 million in the first nine months of 2019, compared to $832.5 million in the first nine months of 2018.
