Net sales were $321.2 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $340.7 million in the third quarter of 2018.
The drop in net sales dollars is primarily the result of a 5.9% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire, offset slightly by a 0.2% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped.
Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper and other raw material prices and product price competition.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 4.2% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 and was a driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $278.2 million, or 86.6% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $286.2 million, or 84.0% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018.
Gross profit decreased to $43.0 million, or 13.4% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2019 from $54.5 million, or 16.0% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, increased to 74.3% of net sales in the third quarter of 2019, from 73.2% of net sales in the third quarter of 2018.
As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis and makes a monthly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO.
The Company applies the lower of cost or market (“LCM”) test by comparing the LIFO cost of its raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods inventories to estimated market values, which are based primarily upon the most recent quoted market price of copper and other material prices as of the end of each reporting period.
Due primarily to decreases in copper costs and price and volume movements of other materials, a LIFO adjustment was recorded, decreasing cost of sales by $4.4 million during the third quarter of 2019.
During the third quarter of 2018, a LIFO adjustment was recorded, decreasing cost of sales by $9.1 million.
Net sales for the first nine months of 2019 were $972.7 million compared to net sales of $969.0 million for the first nine months of 2018.
This 0.4% increase in net sales is the result of a 6.0% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset by a 5.8% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper and other raw material prices and product price competition.
