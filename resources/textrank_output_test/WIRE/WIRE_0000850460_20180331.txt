The unaudited consolidated financial statements of Encore Wire Corporation (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete annual financial statements.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivables on the balance sheet and require payment on a short-term basis through standard payment terms.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative U.S. GAAP other than Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants.
In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, “Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118),” which allows the Company to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date.
Since the 2017 Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation is expected over the next twelve months, management considers the deferred tax re-measurements and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and the ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions.
The Company expects to complete its analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606), which replaces numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, and provides companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.
On January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of ASC Topic 606 and all the related amendments to all of our contracts using the modified retrospective method.
The comparative information has also not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a right to use asset and a lease liability for all leases with terms of twelve months or longer.
The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
During the first three quarters of every year, LIFO calculations are based on the inventory levels and costs at that time.

Net sales were $291.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $279.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.
This 4.3% increase in net sales is primarily the result of a 6.4% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 15.6% increase in the average selling price of copper wire offset by a 7.9% decrease in copper wire unit volume shipped.
Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper and other raw material prices and product price competition.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased increased 18.3% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 and was the principal driver of the increased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $253.9 million, or 87.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $240.2 million, or 86.0% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2017.
The decrease in gross profit margin percentage was driven by multiple factors, including a 7.9% decline in copper wire unit sales, which was more than offset by the increase of the copper wire spread.
The spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sales price for a pound of copper contained in finished wire increased 10.1% in the first quarter of 2018 versus the first quarter of 2017.
The spread increased as a result of the average sales price per copper pound sold increasing 15.6% while the per pound cost of raw copper increased 18.3%.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, increased to 76.5% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018, from 73.9% of net sales in the first quarter of 2017.
Lower overhead costs as a percentage of net sales somewhat offset this increase in total raw materials cost as a percentage of net sales.
As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis and makes a monthly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO.
