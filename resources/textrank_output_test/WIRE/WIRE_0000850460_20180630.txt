In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606),” which replaces numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, and provides companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.
On January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of ASC 606 and all the related amendments to all of our contracts using the modified retrospective method.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (ASC 842).” Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a right to use asset and a lease liability for all leases with terms of twelve months or longer.
The Company is evaluating the effect that ASC 842 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market.
During the first three quarters of every year, LIFO calculations are based on the inventory levels and costs at that time.
During the first six months of 2018 and 2017, the Company liquidated portions of the LIFO inventory layer in the aluminum wire pool established in prior years.
These liquidations had an insignificant effect on the net income of the Company.
Earnings per common and common equivalent share are computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during each period.
If dilutive, the effect of stock options, treated as common stock equivalents, is calculated using the treasury stock method.
The weighted average of employee stock options excluded from the determination of diluted earnings per common and common equivalent share for the second quarter was 166,500 in 2018 and 129,000 in 2017.
The weighted average of employee stock options excluded from the determination of diluted earnings per common and common equivalent share for the six months ended June 30 was 156,056 in 2018 and 121,445 in 2017.

Net sales were $336.8 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $291.5 million in the second quarter of 2017.
This 15.5% increase in net sales dollars is primarily the result of a 17.4% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 17.2% increase in the average selling price of copper wire and a 0.1% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped.
Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper and other raw material prices and product price competition.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased increased 18.7% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 and was the principal driver of the increased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $292.3 million, or 86.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018, compared to $255.7 million, or 87.7% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2017.
Gross profit increased to $44.5 million, or 13.2% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018 versus $35.9 million, or 12.3% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2017.
The spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sales price for a pound of copper contained in finished wire increased 14.2% in the second quarter of 2018 versus the second quarter of 2017.
The spread increased as a result of the average sales price per pound of copper sold increasing 17.2% while the per pound cost of raw copper increased 18.7%.
In aluminum wire, which represented 7.3% of our net sales in the second quarter of 2018, we continued to experience pressure on margins due to import competition from China.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, increased to 76.4% of net sales in the second quarter of 2018, from 75.7% of net sales in the second quarter of 2017.
Lower overhead costs as a percentage of net sales somewhat offset this increase in total raw materials cost as a percentage of net sales.
As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis and makes a monthly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO.
The Company applies the lower of cost or market (LCM) test by comparing the LIFO cost of its raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods inventories to estimated market values, which are based primarily upon the most recent quoted market price of copper and other material prices as of the end of each reporting period.
