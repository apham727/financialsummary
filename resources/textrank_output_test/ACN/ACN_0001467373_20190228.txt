Depreciation expense was $110,635 and $213,348 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019, respectively, and $107,445 and $213,596 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively.
Deferred transition amortization expense was $68,209 and $137,088 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019, respectively, and $71,288 and $153,142 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively.
On September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance.
The impact of adopting the new standard for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 was an increase to revenues of approximately $6.9 million and $19.4 million, respectively.
The impact on our balance sheet as of February 28, 2019 was not material with the exception of the classification of $2.2 billion of receivables and $571.8 million of contract assets, which were previously classified as Unbilled services, net.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the client and is the unit of accounting in Topic 606.
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price.
If a contract modification results in the addition of performance obligations priced at a standalone selling price or if the post-modification services are distinct from the services provided prior to the modification, the modification is accounted for separately.
If the modified services are not distinct, they are accounted for as part of the existing contract.
Our revenues are derived from contracts for outsourcing services, technology integration consulting services and non-technology consulting services.
Many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts.

Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates.
favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.
The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 4% and 3% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2019, we estimate that our full fiscal 2019 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 29.2%, compared with 28.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
The increase in gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower labor costs, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
The increase in gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was primarily due to lower non-payroll costs, compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.0% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and 15.8% for the six months ended February 28, 2019, compared with 15.8% for both the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and six months ended February 28, 2018.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to the recognition of share-based compensation upon the previously disclosed vesting and settlement of our former chairman and chief executive officer’s restricted share units in connection with his resignation for health reasons during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
For the six months ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 20 basis points, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 20 basis points.
Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 13.3%, compared with 13.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 were 17.1% and 18.6%, respectively.
The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 were 26.1% and 23.0%, respectively.
Absent this charge, our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 would have been 15.1% and 18.0%, respectively.
