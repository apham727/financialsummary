These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017.
The results of operations for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2018.
Depreciation expense was $101,814 and $315,410 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, and $86,148 and $255,807 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively.The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 5% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 32.2%, compared with 32.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
The decrease in gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was principally due to higher labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2017 as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by other cost efficiencies and improved contract profitability in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 16.4% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with 17.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and 16.7% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 40 basis points, principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 50 basis points.
For the nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues each decreased 10 basis points.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded a $510 million pension settlement charge and related $198 million reduction in taxes for the U.S. pension plan termination.
Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of net revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 15.7%, compared with 9.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge, operating margin for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 would have been 15.5% and 15.0%, respectively.
The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 were 19.4% and 20.2%, respectively.
Absent these charges and $81 million of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 26.8% and 21.3%, respectively.
Diluted earnings per share were $4.76 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with $3.96 for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
The impact of tax law changes decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.19 and $0.40 during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively.The following table provides information relating to our purchases of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and redemptions of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
