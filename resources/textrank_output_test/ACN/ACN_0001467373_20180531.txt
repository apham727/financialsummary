The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 5% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 32.2%, compared with 32.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
The decrease in gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was principally due to higher labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2017 as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by other cost efficiencies and improved contract profitability in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 16.4% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with 17.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and 16.7% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 40 basis points, principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 50 basis points.
For the nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues each decreased 10 basis points.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded a $510 million pension settlement charge and related $198 million reduction in taxes for the U.S. pension plan termination.

Operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was 14.9%, compared with 13.0% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
The pension settlement charge decreased operating margin by 570 and 200 basis points for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively.
Excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge, operating margin for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 would have been 15.5% and 15.0%, respectively.
The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 were 34.4% and 27.2%, respectively.

For the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded a provisional tax charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) of $41 million and $178 million, respectively.
Absent these charges and $81 million of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 26.8% and 21.3%, respectively.
Absent the pension settlement charge and related taxes, our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 would have been 26.6% and 22.7%, respectively.
Diluted earnings per share were $4.76 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with $3.96 for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
The impact of tax law changes decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.19 and $0.40 during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively.
charge, net of taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.47 in both the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017.
Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.79 and $1.52 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively and $5.16 and $4.43 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $728 million, or 9%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.1% from 90.8% during this period.
