Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates.
The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 6% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 4.0% higher in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 29.7%, compared with 30.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
The decrease in gross margin for three and six months ended February 28, 2018 was principally due to lower consulting contract profitability as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies.

For the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 10 basis points and were flat, respectively, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were flat and decreased 10 basis points, respectively.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).
