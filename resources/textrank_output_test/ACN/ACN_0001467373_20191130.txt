We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.
Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates.
•Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.
•Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins.
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.
The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 2% lower than our revenue growth in local currency.
Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2020, we estimate that our full fiscal 2020 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 1% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 32.1%, compared with 31.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The increase in gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2019.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared with 15.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs.
•North America revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by the United States.
•Europe revenues increased 7% in local currency, led by Italy, Germany, France and Ireland.
