The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements.
On September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance.
The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.
See Note 2 (Revenues) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
As a result of this change, for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, both total revenues and cost of services 
The primary impacts included additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from client contracts, including judgments and changes in estimates.
The impact on our balance sheet as of May 31, 2019 was not material with the exception of the classification of $2.4 billion of receivables and $589.6 million of contract assets, which were previously classified as Unbilled services, net.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the client and is the unit of accounting in Topic 606.
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.

We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.
Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates.
This change has no impact on operating income but does affect ratios calculated as a percentage of revenue, such as operating margin.
If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.
The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 5% and 4% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2019, we estimate that our full fiscal 2019 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 31.8%, compared with 31.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The increase in gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The increase in gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was primarily due to lower non-payroll and labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 16.0% for the nine months ended May 31, 2019, compared with 15.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 15.8% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points.
For the nine months ended May 31, 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues were flat, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 20 basis points.
The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 were 25.6% and 21.1%, respectively.
The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 were 34.4% and 27.2%, respectively.
Absent these charges and $81 million of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 26.8% and 21.3%, respectively.
•Resources revenues increased 19% in local currency, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions.
•North America revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by the United States.
•Growth Markets revenues increased 13% in local currency, driven by Japan, as well as China, Brazil and Australia.
