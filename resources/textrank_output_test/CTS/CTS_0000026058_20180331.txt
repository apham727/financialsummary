Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)".
The guidance in this ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts).
This guidance requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
Beginning in January 2018, CTS adopted the provisions of Topic 606 under the modified retrospective method, which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.
At date of adoption, there was no significant change to our past revenue recognition practices and therefore no adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings was required.
During the three months period ended March 31, 2018, we recognized revenues of $131 that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
The increase in contract liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily due to net increases in estimated future discounts and price concessions, offset by net settlements of products sold with rights of return.
The total restructuring liability related to severance and other one-time benefit arrangements under the June 2016 Plan was $1,279 at March 31, 2018, and $1,460 at December 31, 2017.
The remaining restructuring liability related to the April 2014 Plan was $445 at March 31, 2018, and $453 at December 31, 2017.
Amortization expense was approximately $46 for both the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.
We selectively use derivative financial instruments including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to these risks.
The use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to credit risk, which relates to the risk of nonperformance by a counterparty to the derivative contracts.
We manage our credit risk by entering into derivative contracts with only highly rated financial institutions and by using netting agreements.
In January of 2016, we began using forward contracts to mitigate currency risk related to a portion of our forecasted foreign currency revenues and costs.
The currency forward contracts are designed as cash flow hedges and are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.
At least quarterly, we assess the effectiveness of these hedging relationships based on the total change in their fair value using regression analysis.

Sales were $113,530 in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $13,376 or 13.4% from the first quarter of 2017.
Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by $2,751 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar depreciating compared to the Euro and Chinese Renminbi and relating mostly to sales of automotive products.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 33.9% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 34.2% in the first quarter of 2017.
Research and development expenses were $6,507 or 5.7% of sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $6,003 or 6.0% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2017.
Restructuring charges were $1,195 or 1.1% of sales in the first quarter of 2018.
Restructuring charges were $777 or 0.8% of sales in the first quarter of 2017.
Operating earnings were $13,359 or 11.8% of sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to operating earnings of $12,196 or 12.2% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2017 as a result of the items discussed above.
Interest income increased due to higher cash balances and interest rates.
Other income in the first quarter of 2018 was principally driven by foreign currency translation gains, mainly due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro during the quarter.
Our effective income tax rate was 24.5% and 30.6% in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, was primarily attributed to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018 and additional tax expense of $241 associated with measurement period adjustments to provisional amounts recorded in the prior year as allowed for under the guidance issued in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. Cash and cash equivalents were $121,383 at March 31, 2018, and $113,572 at December 31, 2017, of which $115,167 and $112,531, respectively, were held outside the United States.
The increase in cash and cash equivalents of $7,811 was primarily driven by cash generated from operating activities of $20,154, which was partially offset by capital expenditures of $6,912, net long-term debt payments of $2,300, taxes paid on behalf of employees for equity awards of $1,423, and dividends paid of $1,318.
