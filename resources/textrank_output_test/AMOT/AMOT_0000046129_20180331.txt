The Company has no obligation or intent to release publicly any revisions to any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
Excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange (FX), first quarter revenue was $72.5 million, up 18%.
Solid strides continue to be made with our multi-product, fully integrated solutions that are leading to increased business.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP.
The Company believes EBITDA is often a useful measure of a Companys operating performance and is a significant basis used by the Companys management to measure the operating performance of the Companys business because EBITDA excludes charges for depreciation, amortization and interest expense that have resulted from our debt financings, as well as our provision for income tax expense.
The Company also believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information about the operating performance of its business.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The decrease in operating cash flows during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 2017 is due to increased working capital needs, related to both the acquisition of the Mavel OE Steering business, and organic growth.
The significant cash used in investing activities in 2018 reflects the acquisition the Mavel OE Steering business during the quarter.
Also, during the first quarter of 2018, we made payments of $4,350 for our Revolving Facility, including $1,850 to completely pay off our foreign revolver.
The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to minimum interest coverage and total leverage ratio at the end of each quarter.

We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively.
We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased sales in comparison to quarter ended March 31, 2017 by approximately $4,000.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,300 on our foreign net assets as of March 31, 2018.
We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 (representing 50% of the Term Loan balance at that time) that amortize quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at maturity.
In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022.
