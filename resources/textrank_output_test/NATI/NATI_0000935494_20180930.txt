The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2017, included in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the results of our operations and comprehensive income for three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, and the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
Our operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2018.
During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded a non-cash out of period adjustment of $2.3 million related to the deferral of gross profit associated with intercompany purchases from our equity-method investee that should have been recognized when realized, through transactions with third-parties, beginning in January 2011.
This adjustment was recorded as an increase to "Other long-term assets" on our consolidated balance sheet and an increase to "Other gain (loss), net" on our consolidated statements of income.
We evaluated the adjustment from a qualitative and quantitative perspective and concluded that the amount of income was not material to any individual prior quarter or year and that the cumulative out of period adjustment was not expected to be material to our full year 2018 results.
Stock awards to acquire 36,600 shares and 40,700 shares for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 537,000 shares and 22,300 shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were excluded in the computations of diluted EPS because the effect of including the stock awards would have been anti-dilutive.
We adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments ("new revenue standard") as of January 1, 2018.
The impact of this new guidance on our accounting policies and operating results is described below.
There were no other significant changes in our accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Unbilled receivables represent amounts for which revenue has been recognized but which have not yet been invoiced to the customer.
The current portion of unbilled receivables is included in "accounts receivable, net" on the consolidated balance sheet and is not material.
Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are in included in cost of sales.
Under this method, we evaluated all contracts that were in effect at the beginning of 2018 as if those contracts had been accounted for under the new revenue standard.
We do not expect the impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard to be material to our annual net income on an ongoing basis.
A majority of our sales revenue continues to be recognized when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities.

To maintain a high level of customer satisfaction we strive to offer innovative, modular and integrated products through a global sales and support network.
Sales outside of the Americas accounted for approximately 59% and 58% of our net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and approximately 61% and 60% of our net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The vast majority of our foreign sales are denominated in the customers’ local currency, which exposes us to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
(See “Note 2 - Revenue” of Notes to consolidated financial statements for details concerning the geographic breakdown of our net sales).
For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the average of the Global PMI was 52.5 and the average of the new order element of the Global PMI was 52.4.
In connection with these activities, we expect to incur an additional $1 million to $2 million in severance and other restructuring-related charges, net of tax, by the end of 2018.
However, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in the foreign currency markets in which we do business.

We plan to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new and existing products and technologies.
We have made and expect to make significant investments in software development related to the new and enhanced features of this product.
These investments involve a number of risks as the commercial success of such efforts depend on many factors, including our ability to anticipate and respond to innovation, achieve the desired technological fit, and be effective with our marketing and distribution efforts.
If our existing or potential customers do not perceive our latest product offerings as providing significant new functionality or value, or if we are late to market with a new product or technology, we may not achieve our expected return on our investments or be able recover the costs expended to develop new product offerings, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Our Reported Financial Results May be Adversely Affected by Changes in Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the U.S. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
A change in these policies or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and our internal controls over financial reporting, may retroactively affect previously reported results, could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and may require us to make costly changes to our operational processes and accounting systems.
