In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the results of our operations and comprehensive income for three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

Stock awards to acquire 697,800 shares and 6,800 shares for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 350,800 shares and 13,500 shares for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were excluded in the computations of diluted EPS because the effect of including the stock awards would have been anti-dilutive.

Sales outside of the Americas accounted for approximately 62% of our net sales during each of the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, and approximately 62% and 61% of our net sales during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the average of the Global PMI was 53.2 and the average of the new order element of the Global PMI was 53.4.Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk to us as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, geopolitical instability, declines in income or asset values, or other factors.

We have made and expect to make significant investments in software development related to the new and enhanced features of this product.
These investments involve a number of risks as the commercial success of such efforts depend on many factors, including our ability to anticipate and respond to innovation, achieve the desired technological fit, and be effective with our marketing and distribution efforts.
Even if our new products are profitable, our operating margins for new products may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.
