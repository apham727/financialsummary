The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the results of our operations and comprehensive income for three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 and the statement of stockholder's equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.
Our operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for earlier periods.
We have completed a qualitative and quantitative assessment of our lease portfolio, in which the standard had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet but did not have an impact on our consolidated income statement.
Upon adoption, we recognized lease liabilities of approximately $52 million, with corresponding ROU assets of the same amount, based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under current leasing standards for our existing operating leases.
Additionally, we also reclassified approximately $19 million from "Property, plant and equipment, net" to "Operating lease right-of-use assets" related to prepaid leasehold land.
This means, for those leases that qualify, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition.
The principal change to our financial reporting will be the inclusion of the annual disclosure requirement of changes in stockholders’ equity in Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X to interim periods.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables and other financial instruments.
Additionally, in the first quarter of 2019, we granted performance-based restricted stock units to certain executives under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("PRSUs").
The PRSU awards granted during the six months ended June 30, 2019 include a market condition as defined by ASC 718.
There were no other significant changes in our accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Stock-based compensation costs are based on the fair value on the date of grant for all restricted stock units ("RSUs") and on the date of enrollment for the employee stock purchase plan.
PRSUs are RSU awards that vest based on a market condition, currently our stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of the companies included in the Russell 2000 Index at the end of a three-year performance period.

To maintain a high level of customer satisfaction we strive to offer innovative, modular and integrated products through a global sales and support network.
In this time of intense global competition, we believe that it is crucial that we continue to offer products with high quality and reliability, and that our products provide cost-effective solutions for our customers.
For the three months ended June 30, 2019, the average of the Global PMI was 49.9 and the average of the new order element of the Global PMI was 49.5.
We incurred $3 million in severance and other restructuring-related charges, net of tax during the three months ended June 30, 2019.
We have hedging programs in place to help mitigate the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
However, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in the foreign currency markets in which we do business.
(See Note 5 – Derivative instruments and hedging activities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details concerning our hedging programs.)

Moreover, there can be no assurance that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our efforts to increase foreign market penetration.
In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies.
Any violation of foreign or U.S. laws by our employees, contractors or agents, even if such violation is prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
As a result, even if we are currently in compliance with applicable regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not have to incur additional costs or take additional compliance actions in the future.
Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or termination of import and export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
We Make Significant Investments in New Products that May Not Be Successful or Achieve Expected Returns.
