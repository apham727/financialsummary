The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the results of our operations and comprehensive income for three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 and the statement of stockholder's equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Our operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019.
During the three months ended September 30, 2019, we recognized a gain of $26.8 million from the sale of our 136,000 square foot office building and property located at 6504 Bridgepoint Parkway, Austin, Texas (the "Millennium Property").
Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new lease standard will not be provided for earlier periods.
We have completed a qualitative and quantitative assessment of our lease portfolio, in which the new lease standard had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet but did not have an impact on our consolidated income statement.
Upon adoption, we recognized lease liabilities of approximately $52 million, with corresponding ROU assets of the same amount, based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under current leasing standards for our existing operating leases.
Additionally, we also reclassified approximately $19 million from "Property, plant and equipment, net" to "Operating lease right-of-use assets" related to prepaid leasehold land.
This means, for those leases that qualify, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition.
The principal change to our financial reporting will be the inclusion of the annual disclosure requirement of changes in stockholdersâ€™ equity in Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X to interim periods.
We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables and other financial instruments.
Additionally, in the first quarter of 2019, we granted performance-based restricted stock units to certain executives under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("PRSUs").
The PRSU awards granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 include a market condition as defined by ASC 718.
There were no other significant changes in our accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Stock-based compensation costs are based on the fair value on the date of grant for all restricted stock units ("RSUs") and on the date of enrollment for the employee stock purchase plan.

We have hedging programs in place to help mitigate the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
However, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in the foreign currency markets in which we do business.
The following table sets forth our net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 along with the changes between the corresponding periods.
The slight decreases in our net sales during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2019 were primarily related to the adverse impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Orders with a value greater than $20,000 decreased by 4% year over year during the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the year over year increase of 21% in the three months ended September 30, 2018.

Moreover, there can be no assurance that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our efforts to increase foreign market penetration.
In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies.
Any violation of foreign or U.S. laws by our employees, contractors or agents, even if such violation is prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
As a result, even if we are currently in compliance with applicable regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not have to incur additional costs or take additional compliance actions in the future.
Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or termination of import and export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
We Make Significant Investments in New Products that May Not Be Successful or Achieve Expected Returns.
We plan to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new and existing products and technologies.
