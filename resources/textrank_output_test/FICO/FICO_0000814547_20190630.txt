For example, we use estimates in determining the collectability of accounts receivable; the appropriate levels of various accruals; labor hours in connection with fixed-fee service contracts; the amount of our tax provision and the realizability of deferred tax assets.
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
This adoption primarily affected timing of revenue recognition of license revenue on term licenses and transactional revenue on guaranteed minimum fees related to our on-premises software products.
Under the new standard, we recognize revenue when control of the license is transferred to the customer, rather than at the date payments become due and payable when there are extended payment terms, or ratably over the term of the contract as required under the previous standard.
In addition, revenue attributable to a software license renewal is recognized at the beginning of the applicable renewal period rather than at the signing of the renewal agreement as required under the previous standard.
Additionally, under the new standard, when we enter into noncancellable contracts that provide unconditional rights to payment from our customers for services we have not yet completed or services we will provide in the near future, we present receivables — our unconditional rights to payments — and deferred revenues on a gross basis, rather than on a net basis.
Finally, under the new standard we capitalize and amortize contract acquisition costs such as commissions paid for software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) cloud services contracts in excess of one year.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from clients outside the U.S. International revenues accounted for 35% and 33% of total consolidated revenues for the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 34% of total consolidated revenues for each of the nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
A significant portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of products and services within the banking (including consumer credit) industry, and 88% and 86% of our revenues were derived from within this industry during the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 87% and 85% of our revenues were derived from within this industry during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In addition, we derive a significant share of revenues from transactional or unit-based software license fees, transactional fees derived under credit scoring, data processing, data management and SaaS subscription services arrangements, and annual software maintenance fees.
Arrangements with transactional or unit-based pricing accounted for 72% and 75% of our revenues during the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Arrangements with transactional or unit-based pricing accounted for 74% and 75% of our revenues during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.We continue to expand the pursuit of our business objective to become a leader in helping businesses automate and improve decisions across their enterprises, an approach that we commonly refer to as Decision Management, or “DM.” Our DM strategy is designed to enable us to increase our business by selling multiple products to clients, as well as to enable the development of custom client solutions that may lead to opportunities to develop new proprietary scores or other new proprietary products.
Our DM strategy is also increasingly focused on the delivery of our products through cloud-based deployments.
The market may be unreceptive to our general DM business approach, including being unreceptive to purchasing multiple products from us, unreceptive to our customized solutions, or unreceptive to our cloud-based offerings.
As we continue to pursue our DM strategy, we may experience volatility in our revenues and operating results caused by various factors, including differences in revenue recognition treatment between our cloud-based offerings and on-premise software licenses, the timing of investments and other expenditures necessary to develop and operate our cloud-based offerings, and the adoption of new sales and delivery methods.
We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of products and services, and if the market does not continue to accept these products and services, our revenues will decline.
