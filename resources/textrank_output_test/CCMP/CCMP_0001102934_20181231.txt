The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Cabot Microelectronics and its subsidiaries.
Except for the discussion on revenue recognition below, no material changes have been made to the Company’s significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
We have determined that the effect of applying the new revenue standards during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 was immaterial to our financial statements compared to revenue guidance in effect before the adoption of the new revenue standards.
As a result, for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, we are not disclosing the quantitative amount by which each financial statement line item is affected by the application of the new revenue standards.
For the Company’s contracts that have an original duration of one year or less as of the adoption date, the Company uses the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and does not consider the time value of money.
Further, because of the short duration of these contracts, the Company has not disclosed the transaction price for the future performance obligations as of the end of each reporting period for contracts having an expected duration of one year or less.
for disaggregated revenue, the reconciliation of contract balances and transaction price allocation to remaining performance obligations for contracts expected to remain effective beyond one year.
At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods and services promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each material promise to the customer.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a bundle of goods or services, to the customer, and is the unit of accounting under ASC 606.
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
A majority of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation which represents, in most cases, the products, equipment or services being sold to the customer.
Some contracts include multiple performance obligations including prospective tiered price discounts or delivery of free product that we have concluded represents a material right.
Contracts with prospective tiered price discounts require judgment in determining if that discount represents a material right.
Contracts vary in length and payment terms vary by the type and location of the Company’s customers and the products or services offered.
For these contracts, the transaction price is determined upon establishment of the contract that contains the final terms of the sale, including the description, quantity, and price of goods or services purchased.
In certain instances, we receive consideration from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a sales contract.
In such cases, we record deferred revenue until the performance obligation is satisfied, which represents a contract liability, and is included in the contract liabilities discussed in Note 3 of this Form 10-Q.
The Company recognizes revenue related to product sales at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment, or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts.

In the Performance Materials segment, we also recorded strong revenue, driven by increased demand for our industry leading drag-reducing agents, or DRA’s.
Revenue for our first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $221.8 million, which represented an increase of 58.4% from the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Results benefited from the acquisition of KMG, which added $62.0 million to revenue in the approximately six weeks of the quarter post-closing, as well as a 10% increase in CMP slurries and 30% increase in CMP pads compared to the same quarter last year.
Net income was $13.4 million in our first quarter of fiscal 2019, which was $16.5 million higher than the net loss reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which included a $32.9 million charge related to the Tax Act. Acquisition-related expenses and a charge for the fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold negatively impacted net income this quarter by $32.5 million.
In addition, higher amortization and depreciation costs associated with purchase accounting adversely impacted net income in the current quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was $76.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

Although our product offerings have expanded with the acquisition of KMG, our business remains substantially dependent on our electronic materials products, such as CMP slurries, pads and electronic chemicals, which account for the majority of our revenue.
Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and advances in the industries in which we operate, particularly the semiconductor industry, and to adapt, improve and customize our products in response to evolving customer needs and industry trends.
Since its inception, the semiconductor industry, which is the largest industry in which we operate, has experienced technological changes and advances in the design, manufacture, performance and application of IC devices.
Our customers continually pursue lower cost of ownership and higher quality and performance of materials consumed in their manufacturing processes, including CMP slurries and pads and electronic chemicals, as a means to reduce costs, increase the yield in their manufacturing facilities, and achieve desired performance of the IC devices they produce.
We expect these technological changes, and this drive toward lower costs, higher quality and performance and higher yields, will continue in the future.
