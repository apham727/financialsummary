For additional information, refer to Part 1, Item 1, "Business", in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by Cabot Microelectronics pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).
In the opinion of management, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of Cabot Microelectronics' financial position as of December 31, 2017, cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 may not be indicative of results to be expected for future periods, including the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018.
This Form 10-Q does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included in Cabot Microelectronics' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Cabot Microelectronics and its subsidiaries.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company entered into a managed investment arrangement with a third party to invest in fixed income securities.
These assets are classified as available-for-sale securities and are recorded at fair value.
We have presented these securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017 as a current asset due to management's intent to use these funds for current business requirements.
Unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, are recorded within other comprehensive income.
Realized gains and losses, interest and dividends are recorded in the other income, net line item of the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") established a three-level hierarchy for disclosure based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair value.
The following table presents financial instruments, other than long-term debt, that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017.
We have classified the following assets and liabilities in accordance with the fair value hierarchy set forth in the applicable standards.
In instances where the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset fall into more than one level of the hierarchy, we have classified them based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.
Our other long-term investments represent the fair value of investments under the Cabot Microelectronics Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (SERP), which is a nonqualified supplemental savings plan.

Revenue was $140.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, which represented a 13.6%, or $16.7 million, increase from the three months ended December 31, 2016.
The increase in revenue was driven by a $12.9 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $5.8 million increase due to product mix, partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease due to price changes.
Total cost of goods sold was $66.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, which represented an increase of 6.8%, or $4.2 million, from the three months ended December 31, 2016.
The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to a $3.0 million increase in fixed manufacturing costs, including higher incentive compensation expense and, a $2.9 million increase due to higher sales volume, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in other variable manufacturing costs, including material costs, and adverse foreign exchange effects of $0.5 million.

While we are not involved in any legal proceedings that we believe will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, we periodically become a party to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.
Our business is affected by economic and industry conditions and our revenue is primarily dependent upon semiconductor demand.
Historically, semiconductor demand has fluctuated due to economic and industry cycles and seasonal shifts in demand, which can affect our business, causing demand for our products to fluctuate.
For example, the strengthening of demand conditions in the semiconductor industry we experienced during the second half of fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2017 continued through the first quarter of fiscal 2018, following relatively soft demand conditions during the second half of fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016.
