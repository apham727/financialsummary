For additional information, refer to Part 1, Item 1, "Business", in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by Cabot Microelectronics pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).
In the opinion of management, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of Cabot Microelectronics' financial position as of June 30, 2018, cash flows for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, and results of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017.
The results of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 may not be indicative of results to be expected for future periods, including the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018.
This Report on Form 10-Q does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included in Cabot Microelectronics' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Cabot Microelectronics and its subsidiaries.
The results of operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and nine months ended June 30, 2018 include a correction to prior period amounts, which we determined to be immaterial to the prior periods to which they relate and are expected to be immaterial to our fiscal 2018 results.
The adjustments, relating primarily to accumulated earnings taxes of a foreign operation, increased the income tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 by $2,071.
Separately, in Note 14 of this Report on Form 10-Q, we discuss the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") on our financial statements.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") established a three-level hierarchy for disclosure based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair value.
Level 1 inputs consist of valuations based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
The following table presents financial instruments, other than long-term debt, that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017.
We have classified the following assets and liabilities in accordance with the fair value hierarchy set forth in the applicable standards.
In instances where the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset fall into more than one level of the hierarchy, we have classified them based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.
Our other long-term investments represent the fair value of investments under the Cabot Microelectronics Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (SERP), which is a nonqualified supplemental savings plan.

Gross margin, representing gross profit as a percentage of revenue, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 53.6%, compared to 48.9% for our third quarter of fiscal 2017, both periods of which included 90-basis points of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense.
Gross margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was 53.0% of revenue, compared to 49.7% during the same period last year, which includes 90 and 100-basis points of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense, comparatively.
Factors affecting our gross margin for both the quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to last year included higher sales volume and a higher value product mix, partially offset by higher fixed manufacturing costs, including higher staffing-related expense.
We currently expect our gross margin for the full fiscal year 2018 to be at the high end of our revised guidance range of 52% to 53%, including NexPlanar amortization expense; this is an increase from our prior full year guidance range of 51% to 53%.
The increase was primarily due to higher revenue and a higher gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the negative impact of the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $1.24, and the positive impact from higher revenue and a higher gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
Total cost of goods sold was $69.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, which represented an increase of 6.6%, or $4.3 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2017.
The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by a $3.9 million increase due to higher sales volume, a $1.6 million increase in fixed manufacturing costs, including higher staffing-related expenses, a $0.9 million increase due to foreign exchange fluctuations, and a $0.8 million increase due to product mix, partially offset by a $3.5 million decrease in other variable manufacturing costs, including material costs.

While we are not involved in any legal proceedings that we believe will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, we periodically become a party to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.
Our business is affected by economic and industry conditions and our revenue is primarily dependent upon semiconductor demand.
Historically, semiconductor demand has fluctuated due to economic and industry cycles and seasonal shifts in demand, which can affect our business, causing demand for our products to fluctuate.
For example, the strengthening of demand conditions in the semiconductor industry we experienced during the second half of fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2017 continued through our third quarter of fiscal 2018, following relatively soft demand conditions during the second half of fiscal 2015 and the first half of fiscal 2016.
