In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606), which outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on a principle that replaces virtually all existing revenue recognition rules under U.S. GAAP and which requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
ASU 2014-09 also provided the guidance in ASC Topic 340, Other Assets and Deferred CostsContracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40), which includes criteria for the capitalization and amortization of certain contract acquisition and fulfillment costs.

We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, and applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and have elected to apply the new standard only to contracts not completed at January 1, 2018, which represents contracts for which all (or substantially all) of the revenues have not been recognized under existing guidance as of the date of adoption.

For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 23.8% and 29.3% of total revenue, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately 22.2% and 30.0% of total revenue, respectively.
Although no one customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for the three months or six months ended June 30, 2018 or 2017, if we are unable to maintain relationships with major customers or establish relationships with new customers, our licensing revenue will be adversely affected.
The following discussion compares the three months ended June 30, 2018 with the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Revenue was $60.7 million and $57.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $2.9 million, or 5.0%.
Creative Professional revenue increased $7.8 million, or 25.4%, to $38.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $30.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, mainly due to growth in sales to enterprise customers, including our new Mosaic solution, and increased service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our portfolio.
OEM revenue decreased $4.9 million, or 18.0%, to $22.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from $27.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Revenue from our printer imaging OEM customers decreased period over period partially due to lower revenue from customers under fixed fee contracts and partially due to $2.4 million of one-time payments recognized in the second quarter of 2017 from the conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was $10.0 million and $10.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1.8%.
As a percentage of sales, cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was 16.4% and 17.6% of total revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The portion of cost of revenue consisting of amortization of acquired technology was unchanged at $0.9 million for both the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.
Gross profit in the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased 1.3 percentage points to 82.2% of sales in the second quarter of 2018, as compared to 80.9% of sales in the same period in 2017, mainly due to improved margins in our enterprise sales business, partially offset by the continued mix shift between Creative Professional and the higher margin OEM business.
