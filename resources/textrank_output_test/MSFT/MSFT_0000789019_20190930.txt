In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented.
The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation fiscal year 2019 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 1, 2019.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.
Debt investments are impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary.
Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management.
If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost.
In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors.
Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value.
Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method, or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative).
We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value.
Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value.
The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.

We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins.
Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources.
Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services.
Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.
A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices.
Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces.
We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services.
