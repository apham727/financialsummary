We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins.
Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources.
Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services.
Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.
A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth.
