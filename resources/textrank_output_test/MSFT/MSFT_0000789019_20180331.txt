We have also recast prior period securities lending payables to other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Investments for which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.
Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.
We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer.
In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.
Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“SA”).
SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently.We generate revenue by licensing and supporting an array of software products, by offering a wide range of cloud-based and other services to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience.
Office Consumer revenue increased 12% and Office 365 consumer subscribers increased to 30.6 million.
LinkedIn revenue increased 37%, driven by strong momentum across all business lines.
Server products and cloud services revenue increased 20%, driven by Azure revenue growth of 93%.We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins.
Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources.
Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services.
Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.
