These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by QUALCOMM Incorporated (collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company or Qualcomm) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
These condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2017.
The Company operates and reports using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September.
At March 25, 2018, total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units granted prior to that date was $1.3 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.
At March 25, 2018, the Company had 28.4 million restricted stock units outstanding and 7.8 million stock options outstanding.
The Company currently expects the adoption of this new guidance to most significantly impact its licensing business.
Specifically, the Company expects a change in the timing of revenues recognized from sales-based royalties.
The Company currently recognizes sales-based royalties as revenues in the period in which such royalties are reported by licensees, which is after the conclusion of the quarter in which the licensees’ sales occur and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
Under the new guidance, the Company will be required to estimate and recognize sales-based royalties in the period in which the associated sales occur, resulting in an acceleration of revenue recognition compared to the current method.
Upon adoption of the new guidance, licenses to use portions of the Company’s intellectual property portfolio will be considered one performance obligation, and license fees will be recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the license agreement, which is similar to the recognition of license revenues under the current guidance.
The Company currently accounts for customer incentive arrangements in its licensing and semiconductor businesses, including volume-related and other pricing rebates or cost reimbursements for marketing and other activities involving certain of the Company’s products and technologies, in part based on the maximum potential liability.
Under the new guidance, the Company will estimate the amount of all customer incentives.

This information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in “Part I, Item 1” of this Quarterly Report and with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for the year ended September 24, 2017 contained in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
•We continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G- and 5G-based technologies as well as other technologies to extend the demand for our products and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities, including within adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT) and networking.
On March 4, 2018, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) issued an Interim Order Regarding the Proposed Acquisition of Qualcomm, Inc. by Broadcom Limited stating that there were national security risks to the United States that arose as a result of, and in connection with, the Proposed Transaction, and prohibiting Qualcomm from accepting or taking any action in furtherance of accepting the Proposed Transaction or any other proposed merger, acquisition or takeover agreement with Broadcom.
We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property, including patents, software and other rights.
Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
The increases in equipment and services revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily due to increases in QCT and QSI revenues.
The decreases in licensing revenues in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily due to decreases in QTL revenues, partially offset by the reduction to licensing revenues of $974 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 related to the BlackBerry arbitration decision.
The dollar increases in research and development expenses in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily attributable to increases of $19 million and $160 million, respectively, in costs related to the development of integrated circuit technologies, including 5G technology and radio frequency front-end (RFFE) technologies from our RF360 Holdings joint venture, which was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
The increase in research and development expenses in the first six months of fiscal 2018 was partially offset by a $30 million impairment charge on certain intangible assets recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses included $145 million and $250 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively, related to litigation costs, an increase of $102 million and $171 million, respectively.
The remaining dollar increases in selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 were primarily attributable to increases of $77 million in each period in other professional fees and $63 million and $65 million, respectively, in costs related to other legal matters, all of which were primarily driven by Broadcom’s withdrawn takeover proposal, and $14 million and $38 million, respectively, in employee-related expenses, which included our RF360 Holdings joint venture.
The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in the first six months of fiscal 2018 was also attributable to increases of $45 million in bad debt expenses and $35 million in marketing expenses.
Other expenses in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 included $310 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Cost Plan.
Other expenses in the first six months of fiscal 2018 also included a $1.2 billion charge related to the European Commission (EC) fine.
Other expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 consisted of $53 million in foreign currency losses related to the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fine, which was accrued in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and $25 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Strategic Realignment Plan.
