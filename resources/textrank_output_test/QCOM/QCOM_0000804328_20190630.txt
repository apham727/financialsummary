Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, the interim financial information includes all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.
These condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September.
As previously disclosed, in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 30, 2018, we identified an immaterial error related to the recognition of certain royalty revenues of our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segment in the quarterly and annual periods in fiscal 2018 and third and fourth quarters and annual period in fiscal 2017.
Accordingly, we have revised previously reported financial information for such immaterial error, as previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2019.
A summary of revisions to certain previously reported financial information presented herein for comparative purposes is included in Note 11.
At June 30, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units granted prior to that date was $1.2 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.
At June 30, 2019, we had outstanding 26.9 million restricted stock units and 1.1 million stock options that contain only a service requirement.
Adoption of this new accounting guidance most significantly impacts the timing of sales-based royalty revenues, which are the vast majority of our QTL segment’s revenues.

Additionally, statements concerning future matters that are not historical are forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding our expectations concerning: industry, market, business, commercial, competitive or consumer trends; our businesses, growth potential or strategies, or factors that may impact them; challenges to our licensing business, including by licensees, customers, governments, governmental agencies or regulators, standards bodies or others; other legal or regulatory matters; competition; product or technology trends; new or expanded product areas, adjacent industry segments or applications; costs or expenditures including research and development, selling, general and administrative, restructuring or restructuring-related charges, working capital or information technology systems; our financing, stock repurchase or dividend programs; strategic investments or acquisitions; adoption and application of future accounting guidance; tax law changes; our tax structure or strategies; or the potential business or financial statement impacts of any of the above.
•We continued to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G- and 5G-based technologies as well as other technologies to extend the demand for our products and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities, including within adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT) and networking.
•QCT results in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 were negatively impacted by lower modem sales to Apple and a decline in demand from OEMs in China.
•We adopted new revenue recognition accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 that requires us to estimate and recognize QTL royalties in the period in which the associated sales occur, resulting in an acceleration of royalty revenues by one quarter compared to the prior method.
As a result of recognizing royalties using estimates, adjustments are recorded in subsequent quarters to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily when actual amounts are reported by licensees.
Prior period results have not been restated for the adoption of the new accounting guidance and continue to be reported in accordance with the accounting guidance in effect for those periods.
•During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the United States Treasury Department issued new temporary regulations that resulted in a change to the deductibility of dividend income received by a U.S. stockholder from a foreign corporation.
Therefore, the related deferred tax asset previously recognized was written-off, resulting in a $2.5 billion charge to income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
•On July 18, 2019, the European Commission (EC) issued a decision ruling that between 2009 and 2011 we engaged in predatory pricing with respect to two customers and imposed a fine (2019 EC fine) of approximately 242 million Euros (approximately $275 million based on the exchange rate at June 30, 2019), which was recorded as a charge to other expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
We develop and commercialize foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products, including network equipment, broadband gateway equipment and consumer electronic devices.
Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.

In fiscal 2018, all of the costs related to pre-commercial research and development of 5G technologies, of which we recorded $124 million and $340 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, were included in unallocated corporate research and development expenses.
Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, all research and development costs associated with 5G technologies are included in segment results.
Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, certain research and development costs associated with early research and development that were historically included in our QCT segment are allocated to our QTL segment.
The net effect of these changes negatively impacted QTL’s EBT by $127 million and $368 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively.
QCT’s EBT was positively impacted by $53 million and $97 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively.
