These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by QUALCOMM Incorporated (collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company or Qualcomm) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
These condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2017.
The Company operates and reports using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company eliminated the one-month reporting lag previously used to consolidate its RF360 Holdings joint venture to provide contemporaneous reporting within its consolidated financial statements.
The effect of this change is not material to the consolidated financial statements, and therefore, the impact of eliminating the one-month reporting lag has been included in the Company’s results of operations for the three months and nine months ended June 24, 2018.
At June 24, 2018, total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units granted prior to that date was $1.1 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.
At June 24, 2018, the Company had 23.8 million restricted stock units outstanding and 6.5 million stock options outstanding.
The Company currently expects the adoption of this new guidance to most significantly impact its licensing business (Qualcomm Technology Licensing, or QTL).
Specifically, the Company expects a change in the timing of revenues recognized from sales-based royalties, which are the vast majority of QTL’s revenues.
The Company currently recognizes sales-based royalties as revenues in the period in which such royalties are reported by licensees, which is after the conclusion of the quarter in which the licensees’ sales occur and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
Under the new guidance, the Company will be required to estimate and recognize sales-based royalties in the period in which the associated sales occur, resulting in an acceleration of revenue recognition compared to the current method.
Upon adoption of the new guidance, licenses to use portions of the Company’s intellectual property portfolio will be considered one performance obligation, and license fees will be recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee, which is similar to the recognition of license revenues under the current guidance.

This information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in “Part I, Item 1” of this Quarterly Report and with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for the year ended September 24, 2017 contained in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We develop and commercialize foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products, including network equipment, broadband gateway equipment and consumer electronics devices.
We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property, including patents, software and other rights.
Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
The decrease in equipment and services revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in QSI revenues, partially offset by an increase in QCT revenues.
The increase in equipment and services revenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in QCT revenues.
The increase in licensing revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in QTL revenues.
The decrease in licensing revenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in QTL revenues, partially offset by the reduction to revenues of $962 million recorded in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 related to the BlackBerry arbitration decision.
The dollar increases in research and development expenses in the third quarter and first nine months fiscal 2018 were primarily attributable to increases, which are net of cost decreases driven by actions taken under our Cost Plan, of $31 million and $192 million, respectively, in costs related to the development of integrated circuit technologies, including 5G technology and RFFE technologies from our RF360 Holdings joint venture, which was formed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
The dollar increase in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was partially offset by a $30 million impairment charge on certain intangible assets recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses included $162 million and $413 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, related to litigation costs, an increase of $102 million and $275 million, respectively.
Excluding the increase in litigation costs, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $157 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to decreases of $60 million in other professional fees and costs related to other legal matters, principally related to third-party acquisition and integration services, $31 million in other expenses and $30 million in employee-related expenses driven by actions taken under our Cost Plan, $30 million in share-based compensation expense, primarily due to an increase in forfeitures, and $16 million in amortization of intangible assets.
Excluding the increase in litigation costs, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $105 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 primarily due to increases of $118 million in professional fees and costs related to other legal matters, which was primarily driven by Broadcom’s withdrawn takeover proposal and $45 million in bad debt expense, partially offset by decreases of $45 million in share-based compensation expense, primarily due to an increase in forfeitures and actions take under our Cost Plan, and $16 million in amortization of intangible assets.
Other expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 included $112 million and $422 million, respectively, in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Cost Plan.
Other expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 also included a $1.2 billion charge related to the European Commission (EC) fine.
Other expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 consisted of a $927 million charge related to the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fine, including related foreign currency losses, and $35 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Strategic Realignment Plan.
