Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, the interim financial information includes all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.
These condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September.
Each of the three-month periods ended December 30, 2018 and December 24, 2017 included 13 weeks.
In connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 30, 2018, we identified an immaterial error related to the recognition of certain royalty revenues of our QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segment in the quarterly and annual periods in fiscal 2018 and third and fourth quarters and annual period in fiscal 2017.
In accordance with SAB No. 99, “Materiality,” and SAB No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,” we evaluated the error and determined that the related impact was not material to our financial statements for any prior annual or interim period, but that correcting the cumulative impact of the error would be significant to our results of operations for the three months ended December 30, 2018.
Accordingly, we have revised our consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2018 and September 24, 2017 and condensed (if applicable) consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2018 and September 24, 2017, and the three months periods ended September 30, 2018, June 24, 2018, March 25, 2018, December 24, 2017, September 24, 2017 and June 25, 2017, including the related notes presented herein, as applicable.
At December 30, 2018, total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock units granted prior to that date was $1.5 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.
Adoption of this new accounting guidance most significantly impacts the timing of sales-based royalty revenues, which are the vast majority of our QTL segment’s revenues.
Previously, we recognized sales-based royalties as revenues in the period in which such royalties were reported by licensees, which was after the conclusion of the quarter in which the licensees’ sales occurred and when all other revenue recognition criteria had been met.
Under the new accounting guidance, we estimate and recognize sales-based royalties in the period in which the associated sales occur, subject to certain constraints on our ability to estimate such amounts, resulting in an acceleration of revenue recognition compared to the historical method.

This information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in “Part I, Item 1” of this Quarterly Report and with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for the year ended September 30, 2018 contained in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We have revised our prior period financial statements to reflect the correction of an immaterial error as described in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Update” and “Note 11.
•We adopted new revenue recognition accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 that requires us to estimate and recognize QTL royalties in the period in which the associated sales occur, resulting in an acceleration of royalty revenues by one quarter compared to the prior method.
As a result of estimation, adjustments will be recorded in subsequent quarters to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily when actual amounts are reported by licensees.
We develop and commercialize foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless products, including network equipment, broadband gateway equipment and consumer electronics devices.
We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property, including patents, software and other rights.
Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
In fiscal 2018, all of the costs related to pre-commercial research and development of 5G technologies, of which $100 million was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, were included in unallocated corporate research and development expenses.
Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, all research and development costs associated with 5G technologies are included in segment results.
Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, certain research and development costs associated with early research and development that have historically been included in our QCT segment are allocated to our QTL segment.
The net effect of these changes negatively impacted QTL’s EBT (earnings before taxes) by $122 million and did not have a significant impact on QCT EBT in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses included litigation costs of $97 million and $105 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
The following should be read in conjunction with the financial results for the first three months of fiscal 2019 for each reportable segment included in this Quarterly Report in “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we combined our Small Cells business, which sells products designed for the implementation of small cells to address the challenge of meeting the increased demand for mobile data, into our QCT segment.
Revenues and operating results related to the Small Cells business were included in nonreportable segments through the end of fiscal 2018.
QCT accounts receivable decreased by 28% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from $1.36 billion to $987 million, primarily due to a decrease in revenues and the timing of integrated circuit shipments.
QTL results in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 reflected the adoption of the new accounting guidance that requires us to estimate and recognize QTL royalties in the period in which the associated sales occur, resulting in an acceleration of royalty revenues by one quarter as compared to fiscal 2018.
