Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, (a) the terms “EVERTEC,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company” and “the Company” refer to EVERTEC, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (b) the term “Holdings” refers to EVERTEC Intermediate Holdings, LLC, but not any of its subsidiaries and (c) the term “EVERTEC Group” refers to EVERTEC Group, LLC and its predecessor entities and their subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including the operations of its predecessor entities prior to the Merger (as defined below).
EVERTEC is a leading full-service transaction processing business in Latin America and the Caribbean, providing a broad range of merchant acquiring, payment services and business process management services.
We manage a system of electronic payment networks that process more than two billion transactions annually, and offer a comprehensive suite of services for core bank processing, cash processing and technology outsourcing.
We serve a diversified customer base of leading financial institutions, merchants, corporations and government agencies with “mission-critical” technology solutions that enable them to issue, process and accept transactions securely.
•Our ability to capture and analyze data across the transaction processing value chain and use that data to provide value-added services that are differentiated from those offered by pure-play vendors that serve only one portion of the transaction processing value chain (such as only merchant acquiring or payment services).
Our main operating subsidiary, EVERTEC Group, LLC (formerly known as EVERTEC, LLC and EVERTEC, Inc., hereinafter “EVERTEC Group”), was organized in Puerto Rico in 1988.
On April 17, 2012, EVERTEC Group was converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company (the “Conversion”) for the purpose of improving its consolidated tax efficiency by taking advantage of changes to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “PR Code”), that permit limited liability companies to be treated as partnerships that are pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes.
Prior to these conversions, EVERTEC, Inc. was formed in order to act as the new parent company of Holdings and its subsidiaries, including EVERTEC Group.
The ongoing migration from cash and paper methods of payment to electronic payments continues to benefit the transaction- processing industry globally.
In addition, PROMESA imposes an automatic stay on all litigation against Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, as well as any other judicial or administrative actions or proceedings to enforce or collect claims against the Puerto Rico government.
As the solution to the Puerto Rican government’s debt crisis remains unclear, we continue to carefully monitor our receivables with the government as well as monitor general economic trends to understand the impact the crisis has on the economy of Puerto Rico and our card payment volumes.
In addition to the macroeconomic trends described above, Management currently estimates that we will continue to experience a revenue attrition in Latin America of approximately $4 million to $6 million for previously disclosed migrations anticipated in 2018.
Total revenues in the first quarter of 2018 increased by $9.0 million or 9% to $110.3 million.
Cost of revenues amounted to $47.4 million an increase of $3.2 million or 7% when compared with the prior year period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2018 increased by $2.6 million or 24% to $13.4 million when compared with the first quarter of 2017.
Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $15.9 million , relatively flat when compared with the prior year.
Non-operating expenses increased by $1.1 million to $6.5 million when compared with the prior year period.
The increase is mainly related to an increase in interest expense of $0.6 million coupled with a $0.5 million decrease in Other income, net due to a decrease in foreign exchange gains.
Income tax expense amounted to $3.9 million an increase of $1.9 million when compared with the prior year period.
The effective tax rate for the quarter of 13.8% included a discreet tax expense item of approximately $0.5 million that contributed to an increase in the rate.
The Payment Services - Latin America segment revenues consist of revenues related to providing access to the ATH debit network and other card networks to financial institutions, including related services such as authorization, processing, management and recording of ATM and POS transactions, and ATM management and monitoring.
The segment revenues also include revenues from card processing services (such as credit and debit card processing, authorization and settlement and fraud monitoring and control to debit or credit issuers), payment processing services (such as payment and billing products for merchants, businesses and financial institutions), as well as, licensed software solutions for risk and fraud management and card payment processing.

Our senior secured credit facilities accrue interest at variable rates and only the Term B Loan is subject to floors or minimum rates.
A 100 basis point increase in interest rates over our floor(s) on our debt balances outstanding as of March 31, 2018, after considering our interest rate swap, under the senior secured credit facilities would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $4.1 million.
In December 2015, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $200 million.
