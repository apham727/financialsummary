Our main operating subsidiary, EVERTEC Group, LLC (formerly known as EVERTEC, LLC and EVERTEC, Inc., hereinafter “EVERTEC Group”), was organized in Puerto Rico in 1988.
On April 17, 2012, EVERTEC Group was converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company (the “Conversion”) for the purpose of improving its consolidated tax efficiency by taking advantage of changes to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “PR Code”), that permit limited liability companies to be treated as partnerships that are pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes.
The ongoing migration from cash and paper methods of payment to electronic payments continues to benefit the transaction-processing industry globally.
The Oversight Board has broad budgetary and financial powers over Puerto Rico’s budget, laws, financial plans and regulations, including the power to approve restructuring agreements with creditors, file petitions for restructuring and reform the electronic system for the tax collection.
In addition to the macroeconomic trends described above, Management currently estimates that we will continue to experience a revenue attrition in Latin America of approximately $3 million to $4 million for previously disclosed migrations anticipated in 2019.
Total revenues in the first quarter of 2019 increased by $8.6 million or 8% to $118.8 million.
Additionally, revenue growth was a result of an increase in network services related to new managed services projects, as well as, a one-time revenue related to an electronic benefits contract of approximately $2.7 million.
Cost of revenues amounted to $50.0 million, an increase of $2.6 million or 5% when compared with the prior year period.Our secured credit facilities accrue interest at variable rates and only the 2024 Term B is subject to a floor or a minimum rate.Item 1.
