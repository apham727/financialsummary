On April 17, 2012, EVERTEC Group was converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company (the “Conversion”) for the purpose of improving its consolidated tax efficiency by taking advantage of changes to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “PR Code”), that permit limited liability companies to be treated as partnerships that are pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes.
The Oversight Board has broad budgetary and financial powers over Puerto Rico’s budget, laws, financial plans and regulations, including the power to approve restructuring agreements with creditors, file petitions for restructuring and reform the electronic system for the tax collection.
Furthermore, as to the macroeconomic trends described above, Management currently estimates that we will continue to experience a revenue attrition in Latin America of approximately $2 million to $3 million for previously disclosed migrations anticipated in 2019.
Total revenues in the third quarter of 2019 increased by $6.8 million or 6% to $118.8 million when compared with the prior year period.
Revenue increase in the quarter reflected growth across all segments and included benefits from value added solutions, new managed services and other pricing actions.
Additionally, increased revenue was driven by the completion of projects for approximately $2.0 million.
Cost of revenues amounted to $51.9 million, an increase of $2.4 million or 5% when compared with the prior year period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2019 increased by $0.7 million or 5% when compared with the same quarter in 2018.
The increase is primarily related to an increase in salaries and compensation as the prior year includes a significant reversal in share-based compensation expense in connection with a former executive's forfeiture for unvested RSUs, partially offset by lower professional fees and other operating expenses.
Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $17.0 million, an increase of $1.2 million or 7% when compared with the prior year period.Our secured credit facilities accrue interest at variable rates and only the 2024 Term B is subject to a floor or a minimum rate.Item 1.
