Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, (a) the terms “EVERTEC,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company” and “the Company” refer to EVERTEC, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (b) the term “Holdings” refers to EVERTEC Intermediate Holdings, LLC, but not any of its subsidiaries and (c) the term “EVERTEC Group” refers to EVERTEC Group, LLC and its predecessor entities and their subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including the operations of its predecessor entities prior to the Merger (as defined below).
EVERTEC is a leading full-service transaction processing business in Latin America and the Caribbean, providing a broad range of merchant acquiring, payment services and business process management services.
We manage a system of electronic payment networks that process more than two billion transactions annually, and offer a comprehensive suite of services for core bank processing and cash processing in Puerto Rico and technology outsourcing in all the regions we serve.
We serve a diversified customer base of leading financial institutions, merchants, corporations and government agencies with “mission-critical” technology solutions that enable them to issue, process and accept transactions securely.
services, which enable financial institutions and other issuers to manage, support and facilitate the processing of credit, debit, prepaid, automated teller machines (“ATM”) and EBT card programs; and (iii) business process management solutions, which provide “mission-critical” technology solutions such as core bank processing, as well as IT outsourcing and cash management services to financial institutions, corporations and governments.
On April 17, 2012, EVERTEC Group was converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company (the “Conversion”) for the purpose of improving its consolidated tax efficiency by taking advantage of changes to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “PR Code”), that permit limited liability companies to be treated as partnerships that are pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes.
The Oversight Board has broad budgetary and financial powers over Puerto Rico’s budget, laws, financial plans and regulations, including the power to approve restructuring agreements with creditors, file petitions for restructuring and reform the electronic system for the tax collection.
Furthermore, as to the macroeconomic trends described above, Management currently estimates that we will continue to experience a revenue attrition in Latin America of approximately $2 million to $3 million for previously disclosed migrations anticipated in 2019.
Total revenues in the third quarter of 2019 increased by $6.8 million or 6% to $118.8 million when compared with the prior year period.
Revenue increase in the quarter reflected growth across all segments and included benefits from value added solutions, new managed services and other pricing actions.
Additionally, increased revenue was driven by the completion of projects for approximately $2.0 million.
Cost of revenues amounted to $51.9 million, an increase of $2.4 million or 5% when compared with the prior year period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2019 increased by $0.7 million or 5% when compared with the same quarter in 2018.
The increase is primarily related to an increase in salaries and compensation as the prior year includes a significant reversal in share-based compensation expense in connection with a former executive's forfeiture for unvested RSUs, partially offset by lower professional fees and other operating expenses.
Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $17.0 million, an increase of $1.2 million or 7% when compared with the prior year period.
Non-operating expenses increased by $0.3 million to $6.3 million when compared with the prior year period.
The increase is mainly related to a $0.9 million decrease in Other income (expenses) due to higher foreign exchange losses relative to the same quarter in 2018.
Income tax expense amounted to $3.7 million, an increase of $0.4 million when compared with the prior year quarterly period.
Total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 amounted to $360.2 million, an increase of $24.6 million or 7%.
Revenue benefited from the impact of a higher net spread driven by pricing actions, elevated sales volumes in Puerto Rico, higher core banking transactions and an increase in fees generated by network services related to new managed services projects.
Additionally, revenue growth was impacted by one-time revenue related to an electronic benefits contract of approximately $2.7 million and revenue from hardware sales and the completion of several projects of approximately $4.5 million.
Cost of revenues amounted to $154.5 million, an increase of $8.5 million or 6% when compared with the prior year period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $0.3 million or 1% to $45.4 million when compared with the same period in 2018.

Our secured credit facilities accrue interest at variable rates and only the 2024 Term B is subject to a floor or a minimum rate.
A 100 basis point increase in interest rates over our floor(s) on our debt balances outstanding as of September 30, 2019, under the secured credit facilities, would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $3.3 million.
