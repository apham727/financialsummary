Total revenues in the second quarter of 2018 increased by $9.8 million or 10% to $113.3 million.
Revenue growth in the quarter reflected the impact of the acquisition of PayGroup as well as elevated sales volumes in Puerto Rico driven by post-hurricane recovery activity, federal relief and benefit programs and insurance proceeds.
Cost of revenues amounted to $49.1 million, an increase of $6.1 million or 14% when compared with the prior year period.
The increase is primarily driven by an increase in salaries and benefits in connection with the PayGroup acquisition coupled with an increase in equipment maintenance expense.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2018 increased by $3.3 million or 22% to $17.8 million when compared with the second quarter of 2017.
The increase is primarily related to an increase in share based compensation expenses coupled with an increase in salaries and benefits as a result of the PayGroup acquisition and an increase in professional fees in connection with due diligence for a potential transaction which the Company decided not to pursue.
Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $15.7 million, relatively flat when compared with the prior year period.
