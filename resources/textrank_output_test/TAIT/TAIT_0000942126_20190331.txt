In January 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
References to “Taitron,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Taitron Components Incorporated and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise specifically defines.
Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer.
Inventory – Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) or net realizable value.
We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,700,000 and $4,597,000 at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,229,000 and $7,189,000, respectively.
As a result, we expect our components inventory will be more passively marketed and distributed online for clearance through our internet sales portal, however at potentially lower rates due to the pricing pressures normally attributed with online shopping.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our March 31, 2019, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 47% of current assets and 34% of total assets.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
Net sales in the first quarter of 2019 totaled $1,384,000 versus $1,655,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $271,000 or 16.4% over the same period last year.
Gross profit for the first quarter of 2019 was $683,000 versus $654,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 49.4% in the first quarter of 2019 versus 39.5% in the comparable period for 2018.
The approximately 10% gross profit increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales unit pricing contributing approximately 5% and shipments of new higher gross margin ODM products which contributed approximately 4% of the increase.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2019 totaled $530,000 versus $560,000 in the comparable period for 2018.
