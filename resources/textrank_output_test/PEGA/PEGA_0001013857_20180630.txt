In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model for credit losses.

Previously, the Company recognized revenue over the term of the agreements as payments became due or earlier if prepaid.
Any unrecognized license revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period that control transfers or as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of December 31, 2015.
Unbilled receivables in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets increased significantly upon adoption due to the revenue from term licenses being recognized prior to amounts billed, or prepaid by, clients and perpetual licenses with extended payment terms.
This change primarily impacts the Companys contracts related to multi-year cloud offerings, maintenance on term and perpetual licenses, and those long-term term and perpetual licenses with client usage rights that increase over time.
Includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, income taxes receivable, other current assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-term assets (as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017).
Adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 had no impact on total cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing activities in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
(2) Included in other long-term assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Reporting on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Judgment is required to determine whether each product and service is considered to be a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately under the contract.
However, the selling price of our software licenses and cloud performance obligations are highly variable.
Thus, we estimate stand-alone selling price for software licenses and cloud performance obligations using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price minus the stand-alone selling price of other performance obligations promised in the contract.
We analyze various factors including, but not limited to, the selling price of undelivered services when sold on a stand-alone basis, our pricing policies, and contractual terms and conditions to help us make such judgments about revenue recognition.
