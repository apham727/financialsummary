On January 1, 2018 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) using the full retrospective method which required each prior reporting period presented be adjusted to reflect the application of this ASU.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets, recognizing a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
The Company expects that most of its operating lease commitments will be subject to this ASU and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption with no material impact to its results of operations and cash flows.
Perpetual licenses with extended payment terms and term licenses - Revenue from perpetual licenses with extended payment terms and term licenses is now recognized when control is transferred to the client, the point in time when the client can use and benefit from the license.
Previously, the Company recognized revenue over the term of the agreements as payments became due or earlier if prepaid.
Any unrecognized license revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period that control transfers or as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of December 31, 2015.
Unbilled receivables in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets increased significantly upon adoption due to the revenue from term licenses being recognized prior to amounts billed, or prepaid by, clients and perpetual licenses with extended payment terms.
Allocation of future credits and significant discounts - Perpetual or term licenses delivered are a separate performance obligation which now requires us to allocate any future credits and discounts to the performance obligations in the arrangement based upon their relative stand-alone selling prices.
Includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, income taxes receivable, other current assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-term assets (as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017).
(2) Included in other long-term assets in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Contract assets are amounts under client contracts where revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation.
The change in deferred revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2018, was primarily due to new billings in advance of revenue recognition and $168.2 million of revenue recognized, excluding the impact of the netting of contract assets and deferred revenue, during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2017.
Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
The Companys marketable securities, which are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on a market approach using quoted prices, when available, or matrix pricing compiled by third party pricing vendors, using observable market inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, and credit risk.
The Companys investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are valued using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.
If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs.

We develop, market, license, and support software applications for customer engagement and digital process automation, in addition to licensing our Pega Platform application development product for clients that wish to build and extend their own applications.
Our consulting revenue is primarily related to new license implementations.
The change in ACV measures the growth and predictability of future cash flows from committed term, cloud, and maintenance arrangements as of the end of the particular reporting period.
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Reporting on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Thus, we estimate stand-alone selling price for software licenses and cloud performance obligations using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price minus the stand-alone selling price of other performance obligations promised in the contract.
Revenue for cloud arrangements is recognized over the service period of the cloud contract, as compared to license arrangements, which is generally recognized at the contract effective date.
The decrease in term license revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to $35.3 million in revenue recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2017 from a large term license renewal.
The increases in maintenance revenue were primarily due to the continued growth in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software and strong renewal rates significantly in excess of 90%.
The increases in consulting and training revenue were primarily due to higher billable hours driven by an increase in the number of projects during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase in total gross profit in the three months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to a large term license recognized in revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2018.
The increases in maintenance gross profit percent in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were driven by decreases of $0.7 million and $1 million, respectively, in compensation and benefits due to decreased headcount and a decrease in client support expenses as we transferred resources to provide dedicated support to our growing cloud business.
