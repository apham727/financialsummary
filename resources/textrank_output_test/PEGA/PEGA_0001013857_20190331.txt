The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s historic accounting under ASC 840 “Leases”.
As of March 31, 2019, the Company did not hold any investments with unrealized losses that are considered to be other-than-temporary.
Contract assets are amounts under client contracts where revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation.
Contract assets and deferred revenue are netted at the contract level for each reporting period.
The change in deferred revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to $89.4 million of revenue recognized, excluding the impact of netting contract assets and deferred revenue at the contract level, during the period that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2018, partially offset by new billings in advance of revenue recognition.
Deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the benefit period, which is on average 5 years.
The Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and investments in privately-held companies at fair value on a recurring basis.
The Company’s investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs.
For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying value approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these items.
The Company accounts for a contract as a lease when it has the right to control the asset for a period of time while obtaining substantially all of the asset’s economic benefits.

The change in ACV measures the growth and predictability of future cash flows from Pega cloud and client cloud committed arrangements as of the end of the particular reporting period.
Our cloud revenue is derived from our hosted Pega Platform and software applications.
Revenue from cloud arrangements is generally recognized over the service period, while revenue from term and perpetual license arrangements is generally recognized upfront when the license rights become effective.
The decrease in term license revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to lower average revenue per arrangement.
The increase in cloud revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 reflects the shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements from other types of arrangements.
The increase in maintenance revenue was primarily due to the continued growth in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software and strong renewal rates in excess of 90%.
The decrease in perpetual license revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 reflects the shift in client preferences in favor of our cloud offerings and away from perpetual license arrangements.
The decrease in consulting revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in billable hours.
Revenue from cloud arrangements is generally recognized over the service period, while revenue from term and perpetual license arrangements is generally recognized upfront when the license rights become effective.
The decrease in total gross profit in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to the decrease in term and perpetual license revenue reflecting the shift in client preferences toward our cloud offerings.
The decrease in total gross profit percent in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was driven by a shift in favor of cloud arrangements, which are lower margin than our term and perpetual license revenue streams.
The increase in cloud gross profit percent was driven by cost efficiency gains as our cloud business continues to grow and scale.
The increase in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of $17.7 million, attributable to increased headcount, and an increase of $4.5 million in deferred contract commission amortization.
