In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets, recognizing a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
The Company expects that most of its operating lease commitments will be subject to this ASU and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption with no material impact to its results of operations and cash flows.
   Perpetual licenses with extended payment terms and term licenses - Revenue from perpetual license with extended payment terms and term license is now recognized when control is transferred to the client, the point in time when the client can use and benefit from the license.
Previously the Company recognized revenue over the term of the agreements as payments became due or earlier if prepaid.
Any unrecognized license revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period that control transfers, as either a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of December 31, 2015 or as revenue in periods thereafter.
Unbilled receivables in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets increased significantly due to the revenue from perpetual license with extended payment terms and term license being recognized prior to amounts billed, or prepaid by, clients.
   Allocation of future credits and significant discounts - The perpetual or term licenses delivered are a separate performance obligation which now requires us to allocate any future credits and discounts to the performance obligations in the arrangement based upon their relative stand-alone selling prices.
(1)  Includes cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, income taxes receivable, other current assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-term assets (as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017).
Contract assets are unbilled amounts resulting from client contracts where revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the client and the right to payment is subject to conditions other than the passage of time, such as the completion of a related performance obligation.
The change in deferred revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018, excluding the impact of the netting of contract assets and deferred revenue, was primarily due to new billings in advance of revenue recognition and $101.6 million of revenue recognized that was included in deferred revenue at December 31, 2017.
Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
The Companys marketable securities, which are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on a market approach using quoted prices, when available, or matrix pricing compiled by third party pricing vendors, using observable market inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, and credit risk.
The Companys investments in privately-held companies are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are valued using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.
If applicable, the Company will recognize transfers into and out of levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs.
Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including property and equipment and intangible assets, are recognized at fair value when they are impaired.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not recognize any impairments of its assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

We develop, market, license, and support software applications for customer engagement and digital process automation, in addition to licensing our Pega Platform application development product for clients that wish to build and extend their own applications.
Our license revenue is primarily derived from sales of our applications and Pega Platform.
The decrease in total revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to a large term license arrangement recognized in revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and a shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements.
Cloud arrangements are generally recognized in revenue over the term of the cloud contract, as compared to other arrangements, which are generally recognized in revenue on the contract effective date.
The change in ACV measures the growth and predictability of future cash flows from committed term, cloud, and maintenance arrangements as of the end of the particular reporting period.
Thus, we estimate stand-alone selling price for software licenses and cloud performance obligations using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price minus the stand-alone selling price of other performance obligations promised in the contract.
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Reporting on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The decrease in perpetual license revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in the value of perpetual arrangements executed in the three months ended March 31, 2018 driven primarily by a shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements.
The decrease in term license revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to a large term license arrangement recognized in revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and a shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements.
The increase in maintenance revenue was primarily due to the continued growth in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software and strong renewal rates significantly in excess of 90%.
The increase in cloud revenue was primarily due to the continued growth of our cloud client base driven by a shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements.

However, the operating expenses of our foreign operations are also primarily denominated in foreign currencies, which partially offset our foreign currency exposure.
