This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains or incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.(1)  The Company adopted the new revenue recognition standard (ASC 606) on January 1, 2018 and has adjusted prior periods to conform.
On January 1, 2018 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) using the full retrospective method which required each prior reporting period presented to be adjusted to reflect the application of this ASU.
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model for credit losses.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets, recognizing a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
The Company adopted ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 on January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective method, which required the Company to retrospectively adjust the prior periods presented.
Previously the Company recognized revenue over the term of the agreements as payments became due or earlier if prepaid.
Any unrecognized license revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period that control transfers, as either a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of December 31, 2015 or as revenue in periods thereafter.
Unbilled receivables in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets increased significantly due to the revenue from perpetual license with extended payment terms and term license being recognized prior to amounts billed, or prepaid by, clients.
ASC 340-40 requires these costs to be recognized as an asset when incurred and to be expensed over the period of expected benefit, which is on average five years.
This change primarily impacts the Companys contracts related to multi-year cloud offerings, maintenance on term and perpetual licenses, and those long-term term and perpetual licenses with client usage rights that increase over time.
(1)  Includes cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, income taxes receivable, other current assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-term assets (as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017).We develop, market, license, and support software applications for customer engagement and digital process automation, in addition to licensing our Pega Platform application development product for clients that wish to build and extend their own applications.
Our license revenue is primarily derived from sales of our applications and Pega Platform.
Our consulting revenue is primarily related to new license implementations.
The decrease in total revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to a large term license arrangement recognized in revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and a shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements.
Cloud arrangements are generally recognized in revenue over the term of the cloud contract, as compared to other arrangements, which are generally recognized in revenue on the contract effective date.
The change in ACV measures the growth and predictability of future cash flows from committed term, cloud, and maintenance arrangements as of the end of the particular reporting period.
