Effective June 30, 2019, the first day of adoption, the Company recognized $61.0 million of operating lease right-of-use assets and $65.2 million of operating lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Lease right-of-use (ROU) assets are recorded as other assets, short-term lease obligations are recorded as accrued expenses and long-term lease obligations are recorded as other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Company’s classes of assets include real estate leases, equipment leases, and vehicle leases.
Lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date.
