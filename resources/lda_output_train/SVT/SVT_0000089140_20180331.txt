The CPG consumer products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets. Consumer sales are moderately seasonal. Sales are direct to consumer, through national and international distributors, and through retailers such as big box, hardware, supermarket, variety, department, discount, gift, drug, outdoors and sporting stores. The CPG also sells knives and tools, principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives, to various branches of the United States Government which accounted for less than 2% of the Company’s consolidate revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. 
The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $1,456,000 or 16.0% for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. During this period ATG increased commercial shipments by approximately $1,590,000 offset by a CPG decrease in commercial shipment of approximately $205,000. ATG also increased government shipments by approximately $106,000 offset by a CPG decrease in government shipments of approximately $35,000. 
Depreciation and amortization remained relatively consistent for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. Depreciation expense fluctuates due to variable estimated useful lives of depreciable property (as identified in Note 2, Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements) as well as the amount and nature of capital expenditures in current and previous periods. It is anticipated that the Company’s future capital expenditures and related depreciation and amortization expense will follow the Company’s requirements to support its manufacturing delivery commitments and to implement certain information technology improvements. 
The Company used approximately $113,000 in cash from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The primary uses of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 includes the increase in accounts receivable and inventory due to the increase in revenue partially offset by the generation of cash primarily due to the timing of payments to our suppliers. The Company’s primary use of cash in its financing and investing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2018 included approximately $172,000 of current principal payments on long-term debt, approximately $117,000 for the purchase of treasury shares, partially offset by the proceeds from our lease line of credit of $92,000. The Company also expended approximately $511,000 for capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
