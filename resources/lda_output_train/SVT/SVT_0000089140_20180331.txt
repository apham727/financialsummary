During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 approximately 9% of the Company’s revenues were derived from contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government or their prime contractors and their subcontractors.
The CPG also sells knives and tools, principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives, to various branches of the United States Government which accounted for less than 2% of the Company’s consolidate revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $1,456,000 or 16.0% for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017.
ATG also increased government shipments by approximately $106,000 offset by a CPG decrease in government shipments of approximately $35,000.
It is anticipated that the Company’s future capital expenditures and related depreciation and amortization expense will follow the Company’s requirements to support its manufacturing delivery commitments and to implement certain information technology improvements.
The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 16.5% and 750.0% for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended in 2018 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily as a result of the effect of permanent differences.
The effective tax rate for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 includes approximately $19,000 of tax benefit resulting from the vesting of restricted stock awards.
The Company’s primary liquidity and capital requirements relate to working capital needs; primarily inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable as well as capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and principal and interest payments on debt.
The primary uses of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 includes the increase in accounts receivable and inventory due to the increase in revenue partially offset by the generation of cash primarily due to the timing of payments to our suppliers.
The Company’s primary use of cash in its financing and investing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2018 included approximately $172,000 of current principal payments on long-term debt, approximately $117,000 for the purchase of treasury shares, partially offset by the proceeds from our lease line of credit of $92,000.
The Company believes its cash generating capability and financial condition, together with available credit facilities will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs.
