The primary use of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 include working capital requirements, mainly an increase in accounts receivables and inventories of approximately $298,000 and $437,000, respectively.
The Company obtained a lease line of credit for equipment financing in the amount of $1,000,000 available until June 28, 2018.
