The CPG also sells knives and tools, principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives, to various branches of the United States Government which accounted for less than 2% of the Company’s consolidate revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
See also Note 10, Business Segments, for information concerning business segment operating results.
The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $3,565,000 or 15.8% for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018.
The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $2,121,000 or 17.8% for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018.
The Company’s consolidated gross margin for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 increased approximately $368,000 or 7.4% when compared to the same period in 2018.
Gross margin increased in the six month period ended June 30, 2019 due to the increase in units shipped of approximately $740,000 at the ATG.
This is partially offset by a decrease in units shipped of approximately $1,453,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period of 2018.
The Company’s consolidated gross margin for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 increased approximately $345,000 or 11.8% when compared to the same period in 2018.
Gross margin increased in the three month period ended June 30, 2019 due to the increase in units shipped of approximately $473,000 at the ATG.
This is partially offset by a decrease in units shipped of approximately $1,389,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period of 2018.
This is primarily due to the higher interest rates on the bank loans and a full year of interest paid on the equipment financing lease obligations.
Net income for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 increased approximately $7,000, when compared to the same periods in 2018.
This increase is primarily the result of increases in revenue at both the ATG and CPG business segments partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses at both business segments.
At June 30, 2019, the Company had working capital of approximately $22,805,000 ($23,141,000 – 2018) of which approximately $1,849,000 ($2,598,000 – 2018) was comprised of cash.
The improvement in working capital is attributable to a decrease in number of day’s accounts receivable outstanding, an increase in the number of day’s accounts payable outstanding and an improvement in inventory turns.
