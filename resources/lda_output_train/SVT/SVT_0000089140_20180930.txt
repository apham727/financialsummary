The CPG consumer products are marketed throughout the United States and in select foreign markets. Consumer sales are moderately seasonal. Sales are direct to consumer, through national and international distributors, and through retailers such as big box, hardware, supermarket, variety, department, discount, gift, drug, outdoors and sporting stores. The CPG also sells knives and tools, principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives, to various branches of the United States Government which accounted for less than 5% and 7% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
The Company’s consolidated revenue from operations increased approximately $5,229,000 or 17.4% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. During this period the ATG increased commercial shipments by approximately $6,507,000 offset by the CPG commercial shipments decrease of approximately $609,000. Both ATG and CPG decreased government shipments by approximately $447,000 and $222,000, respectively, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.  
The consolidated revenue increase for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 is primarily attributed to ATG with increased number of units shipped of approximately $3,091,000 and average price increases of approximately $2,969,000. This is offset by a decrease in revenue at the CPG due to a decrease in the number of units shipped of approximately $456,000 and average price decreases of approximately $375,000 as compared to the same nine month period ended September 30, 2017. 
The Company’s consolidated revenue from operations increased approximately $1,443,000 or 12.7% for the three month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. During this period the ATG increased commercial shipments by approximately $2,142,000 offset by the CPG commercial shipments decrease of approximately $134,000. Both ATG and CPG decreased government shipments by approximately $421,000 and $144,000, respectively, during the three month period ended September 30, 2018. 
The consolidated revenue increase for the three month period ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017 is primarily attributed to increased average prices of approximately $1,155,000 and increased number of units shipped of approximately $566,000 at the ATG. This is partially offset by an overall decrease in revenue at the CPG. The decrease in revenue at the CPG is primarily attributed to average price decreases of approximately $352,000 offset slightly by volume increases of approximately $74,000 as compared to the same three month period ended September 30, 2017. 
Gross margin improved in the three month period ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to the increased number of units shipped of approximately $228,000 and increased average prices of approximately $726,000 at the ATG as compared to the same period in 2017. This is partially offset by a decrease in average prices of approximately $108,000 offset slightly by an increase in units shipped of approximately $3,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period in 2017. 
The Company utilized approximately $24,000 in cash from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The primary use of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2018 includes working capital requirements, increased receivables due to timing of shipments and payments by customers and increase in inventory raw materials for increased production offset by timing differences on payments to vendors. The Company’s primary use of cash in its financing and investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 included approximately $410,000 of principal payments on long-term debt as well as approximately $150,000 for the purchase of treasury shares. The Company also expended approximately $1,429,000 for capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
