The CPG also sells knives and tools, principally machetes, bayonets, survival knives and kitchen knives, to various branches of the United States Government which accounted for less than 2% of the Company’s consolidate revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.
The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $3,159,000 or 9.0% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018.
During this period the ATG increased both commercial shipments by approximately $3,117,000 and government shipments by approximately $781,000.
This was partially offset by the CPG decrease of commercial shipments by approximately $655,000 and government shipments by approximately $84,000.
The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations decreased approximately $406,000 or 3.2% for the three month period ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018.
During this period the ATG increased both commercial shipments by approximately $197,000 and government shipments by approximately $344,000.
The Company’s consolidated gross margin for the nine month period ended September 30, 2019 was flat when compared to the same period in 2018.
The Company’s consolidated gross margin for the three month period ended September 30, 2019 decreased approximately $405,000 or 10.3% when compared to the same period in 2018.
Interest expense increased by 10.0% and 10.7% in the nine and three month periods ended September 30, 2019, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2018.
This is primarily due to the higher interest rates on the bank loans and a full year of interest paid on the equipment financing lease obligations.
The Company’s effective tax rate was approximately 17.4% and 20.7% for the three month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Company’s primary liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relate to working capital needs; primarily inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and principal payments on debt.
The increase in working capital is attributable to an increase in inventory, mainly attributable to the ATG’s production increase slightly offset by improved number of days in accounts payable.
Cash was generated primarily through net income of approximately $1,944,000, adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash of approximately $1,042,000 and timing of accounts payable of approximately $848,000.
