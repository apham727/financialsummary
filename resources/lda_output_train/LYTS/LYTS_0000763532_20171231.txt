Product revenue is recognized on product-only orders upon passing of title and risk of loss, generally at time of shipment. In certain arrangements with customers, as is the case with the sale of some of our solid-state LED (light emitting diode) video screens, revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance of the video screen at the job site. Product revenue related to orders where the customer requires the Company to install the product is recognized when the product is installed. The Company provides product warranties and certain post-shipment service, support and maintenance of certain solid state LED video screens. 
In situations where the Company is responsible for re-imaging programs with multiple sites, each site is viewed as a separate unit of accounting and has stand-alone value to the customer. Revenue is recognized upon the Company’s complete performance at the location, which  may include a site survey, graphics products, lighting products, and installation of products. The selling price assigned to each site is based upon an agreed upon price between the Company and its customer and reflects the estimated selling price for that site relative to the selling price for sites with similar image requirements.  
The Company also evaluates the appropriateness of revenue recognition in accordance with the accounting standards on software revenue recognition. Our solid-state LED video screens and active digital signage contain software elements which the Company has determined are incidental. 
The cash balance includes cash and cash equivalents which have original maturities of less than three months. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposits and a bank money market account that is stated at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company maintains balances at financial institutions in the United States. In the United States, the FDIC limit for insurance coverage on non-interest bearing accounts is $250,000. As of  December 31, 2017 and  June 30, 2017, the Company had bank balances of $4,827,512 and $4,488,000, respectively, without insurance coverage.  
The Company maintains an inventory reserve for obsolete and excess inventory. The Company first determines its obsolete inventory reserve by considering specific known obsolete items, and then by applying certain percentages to specific inventory categories based upon inventory turns. The Company uses various tools, in addition to inventory turns, to identify which inventory items have the potential to become obsolete. A combination of financial modeling and qualitative input factors are used to establish excess and obsolete inventory reserves and management adjusts these reserves as more information becomes available about the ultimate disposition of the inventory item.  
Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment analyses, long-lived asset impairment analyses, and in the purchase price of acquired companies (if any). The accounting guidance on fair value measurement was used to measure the fair value of these nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities. 
The computation of basic earnings per common share is based on the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period net of treasury shares held in the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The computation of diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period and includes common share equivalents. Common share equivalents include the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock units, contingently issuable shares and common shares to be issued under a deferred compensation plan, all of which totaled 756,000 and 787,000 shares for the three month ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 686,000 shares and 852,000 shares for the six months ended  December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See further discussion of earnings per share in Note 4. 
In  February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after  December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company has not yet determined the impact the amended guidance will have on its financial statements.  
In  March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” This amended guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after  December 15, 2016, or the Company’s fiscal 2018. We adopted this standard on  July 1, 2017 and recognized excess tax benefits of $87,354 in income tax expense during the six months ended  December 31, 2017. The amount  may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that  may be recognized as any excess tax benefits recognized would be dependent on future stock price, employee exercise behavior and applicable tax rates. Prior to  July 1, 2017, excess tax benefits were recognized in additional paid-in capital. Additionally, excess tax benefits are now included in net cash flows provided by operating activities rather than net cash flows provided by financing activities in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The treatment of forfeitures has not changed, as the Company is electing to continue the current process of estimating forfeiture at the time of grant. The Company had no unrecognized excess tax benefits from prior periods to record upon the adoption of this ASU. 
The Company’s corporate administration activities are reported in the Corporate and Eliminations line item. These activities primarily include intercompany profit in inventory eliminations, expense related to certain corporate officers and support staff, the Company’s internal audit staff, expense related to the Company’s Board of Directors, stock option expense for options granted to corporate administration employees, certain consulting expenses, investor relations activities, and a portion of the Company’s legal, auditing and professional fee expenses. Corporate identifiable assets primarily consist of cash, invested cash (if any), refundable income taxes (if any), and deferred income taxes. 
The segment net sales reported above represent sales to external customers. Segment operating income, which is used in management’s evaluation of segment performance, represents net sales less all operating expenses. Identifiable assets are those assets used by each segment in its operations.  
Carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment. The Company  may first assess qualitative factors in order to determine if goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If through the qualitative assessment it is determined that it is more likely than not that goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not impaired, no further testing is required. If it is determined more likely than not that goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are impaired, or if the Company elects not to first assess qualitative factors, the Company’s impairment testing continues with the estimation of the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets using a combination of a market approach and an income (discounted cash flow) approach, at the reporting unit level. The estimation of the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. The estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could increase or decrease an impairment charge. Company management uses its judgment in assessing whether assets  may have become impaired between annual impairment tests. Indicators such as adverse business conditions, economic factors and technological change or competitive activities  may signal that an asset has become impaired. 
The Company identified its reporting units in conjunction with its annual goodwill impairment testing. The Company has a total of three reporting units that contain goodwill. There are two reporting units within the Lighting Segment and one reporting unit within the Graphics Segment. One reporting unit previously reported in the Technology Segment has been transferred to the Lighting Segment as a result of the merge of the Technology Segment with the Lighting Segment (See Note 3). The Company relies upon a number of factors, judgments and estimates when conducting its impairment testing including, but not limited to, the Company’s stock price, operating results, forecasts, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgments in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.

Fiscal 2018 second quarter net sales of $92,305,000 increased $6.6 million or 7.8% as compared to second quarter fiscal 2017 net sales of $85,658,000. Net sales were favorably influenced by increased net sales of the Lighting Segment (up $4.1 million or 6.3%) and increased net sales of the Graphics Segment (up $2.5 million or 12.4%). Comparable fiscal 2018 net sales excluding net sales from Atlas Lighting Products, Inc. (“Atlas”) decreased by $7.3 million or 8.5% compared to fiscal 2017 net sales. The Company acquired Atlas on February 21, 2017.  
Fiscal 2018 first half net sales of $179,771,000 increased $10 million or 5.9% as compared to first half fiscal 2017 net sales of $169,817,000. Net sales were favorably influenced by increased net sales of the Lighting Segment (up $7.3 million or 5.5%) and increased net sales of the Graphics Segment (up $2.7 million or 6.8%). Comparable fiscal 2018 net sales excluding net sales from Atlas decreased by $15.0 million or 8.8% compared to fiscal 2017 net sales. 
The reconciliation of reported net income and earnings per share to adjusted net income and earnings per share may not agree due to rounding differences and due to the difference between basic and dilutive weighted average shares outstanding in the computation of earnings per share. 
Lighting Segment net sales of $69,174,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 6.3% from fiscal 2017 same period net sales of $65,076,000. Comparable fiscal 2018 net sales excluding net sales from Atlas decreased by $9.8 million or 15.1% from fiscal 2017 second quarter sales. The Lighting Segment’s net sales of light fixtures having solid-state LED technology totaled $57.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, representing an $11.6 million or 25.1% increase from fiscal 2017 second quarter net sales of solid-state LED light fixtures of $46.1 million. Light fixtures having solid-state LED technology represent 91.7% of total lighting product net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 78.2% of total lighting product net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Total lighting product net sales excludes sales related to installation and shipping and handling. There was a reduction in the Company’s traditional lighting sales (metal halide and fluorescent light sources) from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 as customers continue to convert from traditional lighting to light fixtures having solid-state LED technology.  
Selling and administrative expenses of $13,984,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1.3 million or 9.9% from the same period of fiscal 2017, primarily as the net result of acquiring Atlas. Our comparable selling and administrative expenses excluding Atlas decreased 16.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from the same period of fiscal 2017. The more notable quarter-over-quarter changes impacting the $1.3 million increase in selling and administrative expenses are increased employee compensation and benefits expense ($0.8 million), decreased commission expense ($1.1 million), and increased amortization expense ($0.6 million).  
Graphics Segment net sales of $23,131,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $2.5 million or 12.4% from fiscal 2017 same period net sales of $20,582,000. Sales to the Retail and QSR markets increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared the second quarter of fiscal 2017, followed by a modest increase in sales to the Petroleum market.  
The Company reported $417,000 net interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to net interest income of $20,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The change from interest income in fiscal 2017 to interest expense in fiscal 2018 is the result of borrowing against the Company’s line of credit. Commitment fees related to the unused portion of the Company’s line of credit and interest income on invested cash are included in both fiscal years.  
 Lighting Segment net sales of $137,602,000 in the first half of fiscal 2018 increased 5.5% from fiscal 2017 same period net sales of $130,341,000. Comparable fiscal 2018 net sales excluding net sales from Atlas decreased by $17.7 million or 13.6% from fiscal 2017 second quarter sales. The Lighting Segment’s net sales of light fixtures having solid-state LED technology totaled $110.7 million in the first half of fiscal 2018, representing a $21.4 million or 24.0% increase from fiscal 2017 first half net sales of solid-state LED light fixtures of $89.3 million. Light fixtures having solid-state LED technology represent 88.3% of total lighting product net sales in the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to 75.2% of total lighting product net sales in the first half of fiscal 2017. Total lighting product net sales excludes sales related to installation and shipping and handling. There was a reduction in the Company’s traditional lighting sales (metal halide and fluorescent light sources) from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 as customers continue to convert from traditional lighting to light fixtures having solid-state LED technology.  
Selling and administrative expenses of $27,587,000 in the first half of fiscal 2018 excluding the $28 million goodwill impairment charge, increased $2.1 million or 8.1% from the same period of fiscal 2017 primarily as the net result of acquiring Atlas. Our comparable selling and administrative expenses excluding Atlas decreased 17.5% in the first half of fiscal 2018 from the same period of fiscal 2017. The more notable year-over-year changes impacting the $2.1 million increase in selling and administrative expenses are increased employee compensation and benefits expense ($1.3 million), increased research and development expense ($0.2 million), decreased commission expense ($1.6 million), and increased amortization expense ($1.2 million). The Company recorded a $28 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2018 with no comparable expense in fiscal 2017. The Company will perform an impairment analysis in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 in conjunction with its annual impairment test.  
Graphics Segment net sales of $42,169,000 in the first half of fiscal 2018 increased $2.7 million or 6.8% from fiscal 2017 same period net sales of $39,476,000. Sales to the Retail and QSR markets increased in the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 which more than offset a decline in sales to the Petroleum market over the same period.  
Administrative expenses of $6,312,000 in the first half of fiscal 2018 increased $0.7 million or 11.5% from the same period of the prior year. The $0.7 million increase is the result of increased employee compensation and benefit expense ($0.5 million increase) and by a net increase in other cost categories. Most of the increase in employee compensation and benefit expense is the result of the reduction of incentive-based compensation in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 which is driven by the operating results of the Company. There was no similar reduction in incentive-based compensation in fiscal 2018. Also contributing to the net change in administrative expenses are restructuring costs of $0.1 million recorded in fiscal 2017 related to the consolidation of its Beaverton, Oregon facility into other LSI facilities, with no comparable costs in fiscal 2018.  
The Company reported $820,000 net interest expense in the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to net interest income of $34,000 in the first half of fiscal 2017. The change from interest income in fiscal 2017 to interest expense in fiscal 2018 is the result of borrowing against the Company’s line of credit. Commitment fees related to the unused portion of the Company’s line of credit and interest income on invested cash are included in both fiscal years.  
The Company considers its level of cash on hand, borrowing capacity, current ratio and working capital levels to be its most important measures of short-term liquidity. For long-term liquidity indicators, the Company believes its ratio of long-term debt to equity and its historical levels of net cash flows from operating activities to be the most important measures. 
Net inventories of $48.7 million at December 31, 2017 decreased $1.4 million from $50.0 million at June 30, 2017. The decrease of $1.4 million is the result of a decrease in gross inventory of $1.0 million and an increase in obsolescence reserves of $0.4 million. Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory increases occurred in the first half of fiscal 2018 in the Graphics Segment of approximately $0.9 million which was more than offset by a decrease in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $2.2 million.
