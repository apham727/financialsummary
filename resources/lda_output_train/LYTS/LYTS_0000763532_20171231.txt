 The accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these financial statements.
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information, and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LSI Industries Inc. (an Ohio corporation) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”), all of which are wholly owned.
In certain arrangements with customers, as is the case with the sale of some of our solid-state LED (light emitting diode) video screens, revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance of the video screen at the job site.
Product revenue related to orders where the customer requires the Company to install the product is recognized when the product is installed.
The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities, other than normal warranties.
Service revenue from integrated design, project and construction management, and site permitting is recognized when all products at a customer site have been installed.
Revenue from the management of media content and digital hardware related to active digital signage is recognized evenly over the service period with the customer.
In situations where the Company is responsible for re-imaging programs with multiple sites, each site is viewed as a separate unit of accounting and has stand-alone value to the customer.
Revenue is recognized upon the Company’s complete performance at the location, which  may include a site survey, graphics products, lighting products, and installation of products.
The selling price assigned to each site is based upon an agreed upon price between the Company and its customer and reflects the estimated selling price for that site relative to the selling price for sites with similar image requirements.
The Company also evaluates the appropriateness of revenue recognition in accordance with the accounting standards on software revenue recognition.

Comparable fiscal 2018 net sales excluding net sales from Atlas Lighting Products, Inc. (“Atlas”) decreased by $7.3 million or 8.5% compared to fiscal 2017 net sales.
The increase in adjusted operating income was the net result of increased net sales, increased gross profit and increased gross profit as a percentage of sales, and an increase in selling and administrative expenses.
The change from operating income in fiscal 2017 to an operating loss in fiscal 2018 is primarily the result of a $28 million goodwill impairment in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The Company believes it is appropriate to evaluate its performance after making adjustments to the as-reported U.S. GAAP operating income, net income, and earnings per share.
The reconciliation of reported net income and earnings per share to adjusted net income and earnings per share may not agree due to rounding differences and due to the difference between basic and dilutive weighted average shares outstanding in the computation of earnings per share.
