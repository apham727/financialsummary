In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements include all normal adjustments and disclosures necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of March 31, 2018, the results of its operations for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and its cash flows for the nine month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.

In certain arrangements with customers, as is the case with the sale of some of our solid-state LED (light emitting diode) video screens, revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance of the video screen at the job site.
Product revenue related to orders where the customer requires the Company to install the product is recognized when the product is installed.
The Company provides product warranties and certain post-shipment service, support and maintenance of certain solid state LED video screens.
The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities, other than normal warranties.
Service revenue from integrated design, project and construction management, and site permitting is recognized when all products at a customer site have been installed.
Revenue from the management of media content and digital hardware related to active digital signage is recognized evenly over the service period with the customer.
In situations where the Company is responsible for re-imaging programs with multiple sites, each site is viewed as a separate unit of accounting and has stand-alone value to the customer.
Revenue is recognized upon the Company’s complete performance at the location, which may include a site survey, graphics products, lighting products, and installation of products.
The selling price assigned to each site is based upon an agreed upon price between the Company and its customer and reflects the estimated selling price for that site relative to the selling price for sites with similar image requirements.
The Company also evaluates the appropriateness of revenue recognition in accordance with the accounting standards on software revenue recognition.
Our solid-state LED video screens and active digital signage contain software elements which the Company has determined are incidental.
The Company determines its allowance for doubtful accounts by first considering all known collectability problems of customers’ accounts, and then applying certain percentages against the various aging categories based on the due date of the remaining receivables.
Receivables deemed uncollectable are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted.
