Product revenue is recognized on product-only orders upon passing of title and risk of loss, generally at time of shipment. In certain arrangements with customers, as is the case with the sale of some of our solid-state LED (light emitting diode) video screens, revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance of the video screen at the job site. Product revenue related to orders where the customer requires the Company to install the product is recognized when the product is installed. The Company provides product warranties and certain post-shipment service, support and maintenance of certain solid state LED video screens. 
In situations where the Company is responsible for re-imaging programs with multiple sites, each site is viewed as a separate unit of accounting and has stand-alone value to the customer. Revenue is recognized upon the Company’s complete performance at the location, which may include a site survey, graphics products, lighting products, and installation of products. The selling price assigned to each site is based upon an agreed upon price between the Company and its customer and reflects the estimated selling price for that site relative to the selling price for sites with similar image requirements. 
The cash balance includes cash and cash equivalents which have original maturities of less than three months. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposits and a bank money market account that is stated at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company maintains balances at financial institutions in the United States. In the United States, the FDIC limit for insurance coverage on non-interest bearing accounts is $250,000. As of March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2017, the Company had bank balances of $4,391,000 and $4,488,000, respectively, without insurance coverage. 
The Company maintains an inventory reserve for obsolete and excess inventory. The Company first determines its obsolete inventory reserve by considering specific known obsolete items, and then by applying certain percentages to specific inventory categories based upon inventory turns. The Company uses various tools, in addition to inventory turns, to identify which inventory items have the potential to become obsolete. A combination of financial modeling and qualitative input factors are used to establish excess and obsolete inventory reserves and management adjusts these reserves as more information becomes available about the ultimate disposition of the inventory item.  
Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment analyses, long-lived asset impairment analyses, and in the purchase price of acquired companies (if any). The accounting guidance on fair value measurement was used to measure the fair value of these nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities. 
The computation of basic earnings per common share is based on the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period net of treasury shares held in the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The computation of diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period and includes common share equivalents. Common share equivalents include the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock units, contingently issuable shares and common shares to be issued under a deferred compensation plan, all of which totaled 856,000 and 297,000 shares for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 289,000 shares and 853,000 shares for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See further discussion of earnings per share in Note 4. 
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company has not yet determined the impact the amended guidance will have on its financial statements.  
In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, which simplifies the testing for goodwill impairment by eliminating a previously required step. The standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, or the Company’s fiscal 2021. Early adoption of the accounting standard is permitted, and the Company elected to adopt this standard early. (See Footnote 7) 
    (c)   Options to purchase 1,945,348 common shares and 2,035,332 common shares for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and options to purchase 3,086,121 common shares and 1,391,300 common shares for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively were not included in the computation of the three month and nine month period for diluted earnings per share, respectively, because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares. For the three months ended in March 31, 2017 and nine months ended March 31, 2018, the effect of dilutive securities was not included in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because there was a net operating loss for the period.     
The carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment. The Company may first assess qualitative factors in order to determine if goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If through the qualitative assessment it is determined that it is more likely than not that goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not impaired, no further testing is required. If it is determined more likely than not that goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are impaired, or if the Company elects not to first assess qualitative factors, the Company’s impairment testing continues with the estimation of the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets using a combination of a market approach and an income (discounted cash flow) approach, at the reporting unit level. The estimation of the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. The estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could increase or decrease an impairment charge. Company management uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment tests. Indicators such as adverse business conditions, economic factors and technological change or competitive activities may signal that an asset has become impaired. 
A sustained and significant decline in the Company’s stock price in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 led management to believe that a triggering event occurred and that an interim goodwill impairment test was required for one of the reporting units in the Lighting Segment that contains goodwill, as of September 30, 2017. Because the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, the requirement to perform step 2 in the impairment test was not required. The result of the impairment test on the reporting unit in the Lighting Segment indicated that goodwill was impaired by $28,000,000. The Company will continue to monitor market conditions and other events that may result in a sustained and significant drop in its stock price whereby an interim goodwill impairment test will be required. 
As of March 1, 2018, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on the three reporting units that contain goodwill. The preliminary goodwill impairment test on one reporting unit in the Lighting Segment passed with a business enterprise value that was $21.4 million or 15% above the carrying value of this reporting unit including goodwill. The preliminary goodwill impairment test of a second reporting unit in the Lighting Segment that contains goodwill passed with an estimated business enterprise value that was $16.1 million or 69% above the carrying value of this reporting unit including goodwill. The preliminary goodwill impairment test of the reporting unit with goodwill in the Graphics Segment passed with an estimated business enterprise value that was $3.3 million or 319% above the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill. The impairment test is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. It is anticipated that the results of the test will not change when the test is complete. 
The Company performed its annual review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of March 1, 2018 and determined there was no impairment. The preliminary indefinite-lived intangible impairment test passed with a fair market value that was $20.6 million or 604% above its carrying value. The impairment test is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. It is anticipated that the results of the test will not change when the test is complete. 
The Company’s equity compensation plan, the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (“the 2012 Plan”), was approved by shareholders in November 2012. The 2012 Plan covers all of its full-time employees, outside directors and certain advisors and replaced all previous equity compensation plans. In November 2016, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the 2012 Plan that added 1,600,000 shares to the plan and implemented the use of a fungible share ratio that consumes 2.5 available shares for every full value share awarded by the Company as stock compensation. The 2012 Plan allows for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock awards, and other stock-based awards. Stock option grants or stock awards made pursuant to the 2012 Plan are granted at fair market value at the date of option grant or stock award.

Net sales were unfavorably influenced by decreased net sales of the Lighting Segment (down $0.1 million or 0.2%) which was more than offset by increased net sales of the Graphics Segment (up $0.8 million or 5.0%). Comparable fiscal 2018 net sales excluding net sales from Atlas Lighting Products, Inc. (“Atlas”) decreased by $4.8 million or 6.7% compared to fiscal 2017 net sales. The Company acquired Atlas on February 21, 2017. 
Fiscal 2018 nine month net sales of $258,614,000 increased $10.6 million or 4.3% as compared to nine month fiscal 2017 net sales of $247,973,000. Net sales were favorably influenced by increased net sales of the Lighting Segment (up $7.1 million or 3.7%) and increased net sales of the Graphics Segment (up $3.5 million or 6.3%).

Fiscal 2018 third quarter operating income of $743,000 increased $1.5 million from an operating loss of $(774,000) in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The change from an operating loss in fiscal 2017 to operating income in fiscal 2018 was the net result of increased net sales, increased gross profit and increased gross profit as a percentage of sales, and an increase in selling and administrative expenses excluding the items listed below. The Company also recorded an impairment expense of $479,000, acquisition costs of $1,480,000, and a gain on the sale of one of its facilities of $1,361,000 in selling and administrative expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 with no corresponding event in fiscal 2018. 
Fiscal 2018 nine month operating loss of $(19,524,000) represents a $22.6 million change from operating income of $3,110,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. The change from operating income in fiscal 2017 to an operating loss in fiscal 2018 is primarily the result of a $28 million goodwill impairment in fiscal 2018 with no corresponding event in fiscal 2017. The Company also recorded an impairment expense of $479,000, acquisition costs of $1,480,000, restructuring costs of $796,000 net of a gain of $1,361,000 of one of its facilities, in fiscal 2017 with no corresponding cost in fiscal 2018. Also contributing to the year-over-year change from operating income in fiscal 2017 to an operating loss in fiscal 2018 is the net result of increased net sales, increased gross profit and increased gross profit as a percentage of sales, and an increase in selling and administrative expenses. 
Lighting Segment net sales of $61,554,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 0.2% from fiscal 2017 same period net sales of $61,693,000.

The Lighting Segment’s net sales of light fixtures having solid-state LED technology totaled $51.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, representing a $6.3 million or 14.0% increase from fiscal 2017 third quarter net sales of solid-state LED light fixtures of $44.9 million. Light fixtures having solid-state LED technology represent 92.2% of total lighting product net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 81.8% of total lighting product net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Total lighting product net sales excludes sales related to installation and shipping and handling. There was a reduction in the Company’s traditional lighting sales (metal halide and fluorescent light sources) from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 as customers continue to convert from traditional lighting to light fixtures having solid-state LED technology.  
The Lighting Segment third quarter fiscal 2018 operating income of $2,982,000 decreased $1.1 million or 27.6% from operating income of $4,120,000 in the same period of fiscal 2017. The $1.1 million decrease in operating income was the net result of decreased net sales, an increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales, increased selling and administrative expenses, and the gain on the sale of the Company’s Kansas City facility with no comparable event in fiscal 2018. 
Gross profit of $3,977,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $0.5 million or 13.4% from the same period of fiscal 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of segment net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales) increased from 21.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 to 22.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The change in amount of gross profit is due to the net effect of increased net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales), an overall improvement in gross profit margins from the Company’s product, installation and shipping and handling sales, and increased outside service expense ($0.1 million). The Company incurred $185,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 related to the closure of its Woonsocket, Rhode Island facility with no comparable expense in fiscal 2018. 
The Graphics Segment third quarter fiscal 2018 operating income of $415,000 increased $0.9 million from and operating loss of $(480,000) in the same period of fiscal 2017. The increase of $0.9 million from an operating loss in fiscal 2017 to an operating profit in fiscal 2018 was primarily the net result of increased net sales, increased gross profit and increased gross profit margin as a percentage of sales, and an impairment of an intangible asset in fiscal 2017 with no comparable charge in fiscal 2018. 
The Company reported $400,000 net interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to net interest expense of $163,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in interest expense is the result of borrowing against the Company’s line of credit to acquire Atlas in February 2017. The third quarter of fiscal 2018 represents a complete quarter of interest expense whereas the third quarter of fiscal 2017 represents a partial quarter of interest expense. 
 Lighting Segment net sales of $199,156,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased 3.7% from fiscal 2017 same period net sales of $192,034,000.

Light fixtures having solid-state LED technology represents 89.5% of total lighting product net sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to 76.5% of total lighting product net sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Total lighting product net sales excludes sales related to installation and shipping and handling. There was a reduction in the Company’s traditional lighting sales (metal halide and fluorescent light sources) from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 as customers continue to convert from traditional lighting to light fixtures having solid-state LED technology.  
Selling and administrative expenses of $40,549,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 excluding the $28 million goodwill impairment charge and excluding the restructuring charges related to the closure of the Kansas City facility, increased $3.0 million or 8.0% from the same period of fiscal 2017 primarily as the net result of acquiring Atlas. When the goodwill impairment charge and the restructuring charges are removed from the year-over-year comparison of selling and administrative expenses, comparable expenses excluding Atlas decreased 14.8% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 from the same period of fiscal 2017. The more notable year-over-year changes impacting the $4.2 million increase in selling and administrative expenses are increased employee compensation and benefits expense ($1.6 million), increased research and development expense ($0.4 million), decreased commission expense ($2.0 million), and increased amortization expense ($1.5 million). The Company recorded a $28 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2018 with no comparable expense in fiscal 2017. The Company also reported a gain on the sale of its Kansas City facility of $1,361,000 in fiscal 2017 partially offset by restructuring charges with no comparable event in fiscal 2018. 
The Lighting Segment reported an operating loss of $(14,673,000) in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and represents a $25,600,000 change from operating income of $10,972,000 in the same period of fiscal 2017 primarily due to a $28 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge. The year-over-year change was also the net result of increased net sales, an increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales, increased selling and administrative expenses, and plant closure costs including the sale of its Kansas City facility in fiscal 2017 with no comparable event in fiscal 2018. 
Gross profit of $15,086,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased $2.2 million or 17.3% from the same period of fiscal 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of segment net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales) increased from 22.6% in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 to 24.9% in the same period in fiscal 2018. The change in amount of gross profit is due to the net effect of increased net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales), an overall improvement in gross profit margins from the Company’s product, installation and shipping and handling sales, and decreased employee compensation and benefit expense ($0.5 million). The Company incurred $396,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 related to the closure of its Woonsocket, Rhode Island facility with no comparable expense in fiscal 2018. 
The Graphics Segment operating income of $4,146,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased $2.4 million or 142% from operating income of $1,711,000 in the same period of fiscal 2017.
