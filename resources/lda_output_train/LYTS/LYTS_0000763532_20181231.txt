The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information, and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Significant changes to our accounting policies as a result of adopting ASU-2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) are discussed below.
For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
For digital signage products, installation is not a separate performance obligation as the product and installation is the combined item promised in digital signage contracts.
Installation revenue is recognized over time as our customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided through the installation process.
The Company disaggregates the revenue from contracts with customers by the timing of revenue recognition because the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, and timing of our revenue and cash flows.
Legacy products include lighting fixtures utilizing light sources other than LED technology and printed two and three dimensional graphic products.
The Company’s contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, as such the Company applies the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred, and have omitted disclosures on the amount of remaining performance obligations.We are in the business of designing, manufacturing and marketing lighting, graphics and technology solutions for both indoor and outdoor applications.
