A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Significant changes to our accounting policies as a result of adopting ASU-2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) are discussed below. 
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation in its customer contracts or purchase orders. Most of the Company’s products have a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. Control is generally transferred at time of shipment when title and risk of ownership passes to the customer. For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices. Payment terms are typically within 30 to 90 days from the shipping date, depending on our terms with the customer. The Company offers standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations. 
Installation is a separate performance obligation, except for our digital signage products. For digital signage products, installation is not a separate performance obligation as the product and installation is the combined item promised in digital signage contracts. The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties. 
On  July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09. “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective adoption method which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. This approach was applied to contracts that were not completed as of  June 30, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning  July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period. The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $591,000 on  July 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, as described below. 
In  February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after  December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company has an implementation team tasked with reviewing our lease obligations and determining the impact of the new standard to its financial statements. The implementation team has completed a qualitative assessment of the Company’s active leases and is compiling related data in a central repository. The Company will continue to evaluate the new standard’s impact to its financial statements.  
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation within the cash flows from operating activities section and cash flows from financing activities section of the statement of cash flows. These reclassifications have no impact on net income or earnings per share.  
The Company’s corporate administration activities are reported in the Corporate and Eliminations line item. These activities primarily include intercompany profit in inventory eliminations, expense related to certain corporate officers and support staff, the Company’s internal audit staff, expense related to the Company’s Board of Directors, equity compensation expense for various equity awards granted to corporate administration employees, certain consulting expenses, investor relations activities, and a portion of the Company’s legal, auditing and professional fee expenses. Corporate identifiable assets primarily consist of cash, invested cash (if any), refundable income taxes (if any), and deferred income taxes. 
The segment net sales reported above represent sales to external customers. Segment operating income, which is used in management’s evaluation of segment performance, represents net sales less all operating expenses. Identifiable assets are those assets used by each segment in its operations. 
    (c)   Options to purchase 3,536,732 common shares and 3,569,762 common shares for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in the computation of the three month diluted loss per share because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares. Additionally, options to purchase 3,356,101 common shares and 3,549,705 common shares for the six months ended at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in the computation of the six month diluted loss per share because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares. For the three months ended and the six months ended in December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the effect of dilutive securities was not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share because there was a net loss for the period.    
A sustained and significant decline in the Company’s stock price in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 led management to believe that a triggering event occurred and that an interim goodwill impairment test was required for one of the reporting units in the Lighting Segment that contains goodwill, as of  December 31, 2018. In accordance with ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” which was adopted in a prior period, the requirement to perform step 2 in the impairment test was not required. The result of the impairment test on the reporting unit in the Lighting Segment indicated that goodwill was impaired by $20,165,000. 
Amortization expense for intangible assets was $689,000 and $690,000 for the three months ended  December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $1,380 and $1,380 for the six months ended  December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Future amortization expense (in thousands) associated with these intangible assets is expected to be $2,761 in 2019, $2,687 in 2020, $2,682 in 2021, $2,460 in 2022, $2,412 in 2023, and $18,985 after 2023.

Fiscal 2019 second quarter net sales of $89,541,000 decreased $2.8 million or 3% as compared to second quarter fiscal 2018 net sales of $92,305,000. Net sales were favorably influenced by increased net sales of the Graphics Segment (up $2.8 million or 12%) more than offset by decreased net sales of the Lighting Segment (down $5.5 million or 8%). 
Fiscal 2019 second quarter operating loss of $(20.3) million represents a $24.8 million change from operating income of $4.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The $24.8 million change from operating income in fiscal 2018 to an operating loss in fiscal 2019 was mostly the result of a pre-tax $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge in the Lighting Segment in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Adjusted fiscal 2019 second quarter operating income of $1.5 million decreased $3.1 million or 66% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $4.6 million. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. The decrease in adjusted operating income was the result of decreased net sales and decreased gross profit slightly offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses. 
The Graphics Segment second quarter fiscal 2019 operating income of $861,000 decreased $1.4 million or 62% from operating income of $2,255,000 in the same period of fiscal 2018. The decrease of $1.4 million was primarily the net result of a shift in customer mix on higher sales and an increase in selling and administrative expenses. 
Administrative expenses of $2,667,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $0.3 million from the same period of the prior year. The change is primarily the result of a reduction in wage and benefit expense partially offset by an increase in legal and professional fees. 
The Company reported $615,000 net interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $417,000 net interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The change in interest expense from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is the result of higher interest rates on the Company’s line of credit and higher commitment fees on its unused portion of the line of credit. 
The Company reported a net loss of $(15,782,000) in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to net loss of $(1,468,000) in the same period of the prior year. The change in the net loss in fiscal 2018 to the net loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 is mostly driven by the $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 with no comparable charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Also contributing to the quarter-over-quarter change is a $4.7 million charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the re-valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets with no comparable charge in fiscal 2019. To a lesser degree, there were other non-GAAP charges in both fiscal years besides the goodwill impairment and the re-valuation of the deferred tax assets impacting the comparable quarter-over-quarter results (refer to the non-GAAP tables above.) When the impact of all non-GAAP charges is removed from both fiscal years, the fiscal 2019 adjusted net income of $875,000 decreased $2.4 million from fiscal 2018 adjusted net income of $3,267,000. The change in adjusted net income is primarily the net result of decreased net sales, decreased gross profit, decreased selling and administrative expenses, increased interest expense, and a lower tax rate. Diluted loss per share of $(0.61) was reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to $(0.06) diluted loss per share in the same period of fiscal 2018. The weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 were 26,083,000 shares as compared to 25,858,000 shares in the same period last year. 
Graphics Segment net sales of $49,412,000 in the first half of fiscal 2019 increased $7.2 million or 17% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $42,169,000. Most of the increase in sales is from growth in sales to the Petroleum and Quick Service Restaurant markets including digital technology. 
The Graphics Segment first half fiscal 2019 operating income of $3,248,000 decreased $0.5 million or 13% from operating income of $3,731,000 in the same period of fiscal 2018. The decrease of $0.5 million was primarily the net result of a shift in customer mix on higher sales and a modest increase in selling and administrative expenses. 
Administrative expenses of $5,974,000 in the first half of fiscal 2019 decreased $0.3 million from the same period of the prior year. The change is primarily the result of a reduction in wage and benefit expense partially offset by an increase in legal and professional fees. 
The Company reported $1,133,000 net interest expense in the first half of fiscal 2019 compared to $820,000 net interest expense in the first half of fiscal 2019. The change in interest expense from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is the result of higher interest rates on the Company’s line of credit and higher commitment fees on its unused portion of the line of credit. 
The Company reported a net loss of $(14,033,000) in the first half of fiscal 2019 compared to net loss of $(17,097,000) in the same period of the prior year. The change from the net loss in fiscal 2018 to the net loss in the second half of fiscal 2019 is mostly driven by the $20.2 million and the $28 million goodwill impairment charges in the first of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. Also contributing to the year-over-year change is a $4.7 million charge in the first half of fiscal 2018 related to the re-valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets with no comparable charge in fiscal 2019. To a lesser degree, there were other non-GAAP charges in both fiscal years besides the goodwill impairment and the re-valuation of the deferred tax assets impacting the comparable year-over-year results. (Refer to the non-GAAP tables above.) When the impact of all non-GAAP charges is removed from both fiscal years, the fiscal 2019 adjusted net income of $3,078,000 decreased $1.9 million from fiscal 2018 adjusted net income of $5,001,000. The change in adjusted net income is primarily the net result of decreased net sales, decreased gross profit, decreased selling and administrative expenses, increased interest expense, and a larger tax benefit. Diluted loss per share of $(0.54) was reported in the first half of fiscal 2019 as compared to $(0.66) diluted loss per share in the same period of fiscal 2018. The weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share in the first half of fiscal 2019 were 26,058,000 shares as compared to 25,824,000 shares in the same period last year. 
The Company considers its level of cash on hand, borrowing capacity, current ratio and working capital levels to be its most important measures of short-term liquidity. For long-term liquidity indicators, the Company believes its ratio of long-term debt to equity and its historical levels of net cash flows from operating activities to be the most important measures. 
At December 31, 2018, the Company had working capital of $74.8 million, compared to $67.9 million at June 30, 2018. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.49 to 1 as compared to a ratio of 2.61 to 1 at June 30, 2018. The $6.9 million increase in working capital from June 30, 2018 to December 31, 2018 was primarily related to the net effect of increased cash and cash equivalents ($6.4 million), increased net accounts receivable ($5.8 million), increased net inventory ($3.1 million), an increase in accrued expenses ($0.7 million), a decrease in refundable income taxes ($0.8 million), and an increase in accounts payable ($8.8 million). Of the $5.8 million increase in accounts receivable, $5.3 million is attributed to the adoption of the new revenue guidance. The Company proactively manages its working capital, including reduction of the accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) and reduction of inventory levels, without reducing service to its customers. 
Net inventories of $54.1 million at December 31, 2018 increased $3.1 million from $51.0 million at June 30, 2018. The increase of $3.1 million is the result of an increase in gross inventory of $3.8 million and an increase in obsolescence reserves of $0.7 million. Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory increased 4.8 million in the first half of fiscal 2019 in the Graphics Segment which was partially offset by a decrease in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $1.7 million. 
Cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the Company’s line of credit is the Company’s primary source of liquidity. The Company has a secured $100 million revolving line of credit with its bank, with $48.4 million of the credit line available as of January 28, 2019. This line of credit is a $100 million five-year credit line expiring in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company believes that its $100 million line of credit plus cash flows from operating activities are adequate for the Company’s fiscal 2019 operational and capital expenditure needs. The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants.
