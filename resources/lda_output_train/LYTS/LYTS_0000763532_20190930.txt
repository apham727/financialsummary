The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligations in its customer contracts or purchase orders. Most of the Company’s products have a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. Control is generally transferred at time of shipment when title and risk of ownership passes to the customer. For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices. Payment terms are typically within 30 to 90 days from the shipping date, depending on our terms with the customer. The Company offers standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations. 
Installation is a separate performance obligation, except for our digital signage products. For digital signage products, installation is not a separate performance obligation as the product and installation is the combined item promised in digital signage contracts. The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties. 
Legacy products include lighting fixtures utilizing light sources other than LED technology and printed two- and three-dimensional graphic products. Turnkey services and other includes installation services along with shipping and handling charges. 
On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09. “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective adoption method which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. This approach was applied to contracts that were not completed as of June 30, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period. The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $591,000 on July 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, as described below. 
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance effective July 1, 2019 using a modified-retrospective transition method, under which it elected not to adjust comparative periods. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the new guidance to not reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification, and initial direct costs. In addition, the Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease component and the accounting policy election to not present leases with an initial term of twelve months or less on the balance sheet. 
The Company’s most significant leases are those relating to its two manufacturing facilities along with a small office space. Besides these three real estate leases, most other leases are insignificant and consist of leases related to a vehicle, forklifts, small tooling, and various office equipment. All of the Company’s leases are operating leases and are included in other long-term assets with the corresponding liability in other long-term liabilities. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company used its incremental borrowing rate when determining the present value of lease payments. The adoption of the new lease standard resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets (ROU assets) of $10.4 million and lease liabilities of 10.8 million which includes the impact of existing deferred rents and tenant improvement allowances on the consolidated balance sheets as of July 1, 2019 for the Company’s real estate leases. The adoption of the standard resulted in no material impact to consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flow. (Refer to Note 15) 
The segment net sales reported above represent sales to external customers. Segment operating income, which is used in management’s evaluation of segment performance, represents net sales less all operating expenses. Identifiable assets are those assets used by each segment in its operations. 
    (c)   Options to purchase 2,861,423 common shares and 3,146,466 common shares at September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were not included in the computation of the three month period for diluted earnings per share, respectively, because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares.     
In February 2019, the Company amended its secured line of credit to a $75 million facility from a $100 million facility in order to better match its financing needs with an appropriate borrowing capacity. The line of credit expires in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Interest on the revolving line of credit is charged based upon an increment over the LIBOR rate as periodically determined, or at the bank’s base lending rate, at the Company’s option. The increment over the LIBOR borrowing rate, as periodically determined, fluctuates between 125 and 250 basis points depending upon the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), as defined in the line of credit agreement. The increment over LIBOR borrowing rate will be 200 basis points for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The fee on the unused balance of the $75 million committed line of credit is 20 basis points. Under the terms of this line of credit, the Company has agreed to a negative pledge of real estate assets and is required to comply with financial covenants that limit the ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA and require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. As of September 30, 2019, there was $23.2 million borrowed against the line of credit, and $51.8 million was available as of that date. Based on the terms of the line of credit and the maturity date, the debt has been classified as long term. 
In November 2019, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2019 Omnibus Award Plan. The purpose of the plan is to provide a means through which the Company may attract and retain key personnel and to provide a means by which directors, officers, and employees can acquire and maintain an equity interest in the Company. This plan replaced the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan. The number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the plan is 2,650,000 which will be combined with the remaining shares available under the previous plan of 1,147,429 shares as of September 30, 2019 for total number of shares available for issuance of approximately 3.8 million. The plan implements the use of a fungible share ratio that consumes 2.5 available shares for every full value share awarded by the Company as stock compensation. The 2019 Omnibus Award Plan allows for the grant of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, performance stock units, and other stock-based awards. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company sold its New Windsor, New York facility. The net proceeds from the sale was $12.3 million resulting in a gain of $4.8 million. The Company also incurred additional restructuring costs totaling $233,000 related to closure of the New York facility which impacted both the Lighting and Graphics segment. 
The Company leases two of its manufacturing facilities along with a small office space, a company vehicle, several forklifts, several small tooling items, and various items of office equipment. All of the Company’s leases are operating leases and are included in other long-term assets with the corresponding liability in other long-term liabilities. Leases have a remaining term of 1 to 5 years some of which have an option to renew. The Company does not assume renewals in determining the lease term unless the renewals are deemed reasonably certain. The lease agreements do not contain any material residual guarantees or material variable lease payments.

Fiscal 2020 first quarter operating income of $6.9 million increased $4.0 million from operating income of $2.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The $4.0 million increase in operating income in fiscal 2019 was impacted by the sale of the Company’s New Windsor, New York facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 which favorably resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4.8 million. Also contributing to the period-over-period change in operating income is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million with no comparable event in fiscal 2020. When the impact of the sale of the New Windsor facility along with the other restructuring and plant closure costs are removed from the operating results along with the one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019, operating income period-over-period remained relatively flat. Refer to the discussions in the “results of operations” for each of the Company’s reportable segments for further explanation of the period-over-period change in sales and operating income. 
Selling and administrative expenses of $8,060,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 decreased $3.6 million from the same period of fiscal 2019 selling and administrative expenses of $11,625,000, primarily due to the $4.8 million gain on the sale of the New Windsor, New York facility. When the $4.8 million gain is removed from fiscal 2020 results, there was a $1.3 million or 11.1% increase in selling and administrative expenses. The increase in selling and administrative expenses is mostly driven by higher commission expense which is the result of increased sales volume and a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 with no comparable event in fiscal 2020. 
The Lighting Segment first quarter fiscal 2019 operating income of $9,159,000 increased $5.3 million from operating income of $3,850,000 in the same period of fiscal 2019 primarily due to the $4.8million gain on the sale of its New Windsor, New York facility. When the impact of $4.8 million gain is removed from fiscal 2020 results along with the restructuring and plant closure costs in both fiscal years, fiscal 2020 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income of $4,510,000 was $70,000 higher than fiscal 2019 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income of $4,440,000. The increase in sales volume and gross profit was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses.  
The Company reported $431,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $518,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The change from interest expense from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 is primarily the result of reduced borrowings against the Company’s line of credit. The Company also incurred $82,000 expense related to net foreign currency transaction losses from transactions with its customer and suppliers through its Mexican subsidiary. 
The Company considers its level of cash on hand, borrowing capacity, current ratio and working capital levels to be its most important measures of short-term liquidity. For long-term liquidity indicators, the Company believes its ratio of long-term debt to equity and its historical levels of net cash flows from operating activities to be the most important measures. 
The Company generated $6.4 million of cash from operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to a source of cash of $2.2 million in the same period of the prior year. This $4.2 million increase in net cash flows from operating activities is the result the Company’s strategy to aggressively manage its working capital which includes the reduction of the accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO), increasing inventory turns while simultaneously reducing inventory levels, and effectively managing the Company’s supply chain which includes partnering with its suppliers to find the appropriate service level while effectively managing payment terms. 
Net accounts receivable was $58.4 million and $54.7 million at September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. DSO decreased to 57 days at September 30, 2019 from 63 days at June 30, 2019. The Company believes that its receivables are ultimately collectible or recoverable, net of certain reserves, and that aggregate allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate. 
Net inventories of $43.1 million at September 30, 2019 decreased $0.4 million from $43.5 million at June 30, 2019. The decrease of $0.4 million is the result of a decrease in gross inventory of $0.3 million and an increase in obsolescence reserves of $0.1 million. Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory decreased 0.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in the Graphics Segment which more than offset an increase in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $0.4 million. 
Cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the Company’s line of credit is the Company’s primary source of liquidity. The Company has a secured $75 million revolving line of credit with its bank, with $53.0 million of the credit line available as of October 21, 2019. This line of credit is a $75 million five-year credit line expiring in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company believes that its $75 million line of credit plus cash flows from operating activities are adequate for the Company’s fiscal 2020 operational and capital expenditure needs. The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants. 
In November 2019, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable November 26, 2019 to shareholders of record as of November 18, 2019. The indicated annual cash dividend rate for fiscal 2020 is $0.20 per share. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy regarding dividends which indicates that dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion based upon its evaluation of earnings, cash flow requirements, financial condition, debt levels, stock repurchases, future business developments and opportunities, and other factors deemed relevant. 
A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
