The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation in its customer contracts or purchase orders.
For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
For digital signage products, installation is not a separate performance obligation as the product and installation is the combined item promised in digital signage contracts.

Installation revenue is recognized over time as our customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided through the installation process.
Legacy products include lighting fixtures utilizing light sources other than LED technology and printed two and three dimensional graphic products.

Fiscal 2019 first quarter net sales of $84,957,000 decreased $2.5 million or 2.9% as compared to first quarter fiscal 2018.
Fiscal 2019 first quarter operating income of $2.9 million increased $27.7 million from an operating loss of $(24,814,000) in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The $27.7 million change from an operating loss in fiscal 2018 to operating income in fiscal 2019 was mostly the result of a pre-tax $28 million goodwill impairment charge in the Lighting Segment in fiscal 2018.
Adjusted fiscal 2019 operating income of $3.5 million (which reflects the removal of plant closure costs) increased 10.6% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $3.2 (which reflects the removal of the goodwill impairment).
The closure is part of ongoing actions to align the Company’s supply chain to more cost effectively serve the changing requirements of the lighting market.
The Company believes it is appropriate to evaluate its performance after making adjustments to the as-reported U.S. GAAP operating income, net income, and earnings per share.
There continues to be a reduction in the Company’s traditional lighting sales (metal halide and fluorescent light sources) as customers convert from traditional lighting to light fixtures having solid-state LED technology.
When the impact of the goodwill charge is removed from fiscal 2018 results and the restructuring and plant closure costs of $590,000 are removed from the fiscal 2019 results, fiscal 2019 adjusted operating income of $4,440,000 was $630,000 lower than fiscal 2018 adjusted operating income of $5,070,000.
Graphics Segment net sales of $23,525,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $4.5 million or 23.6% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $19,038,000.
Gross profit as a percentage of segment net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales) decreased from 26.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 to 24.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Also contributing to the year-over-year change in gross profit was a $0.6 million increase in overhead spending mostly driven by an increase in wage expense.
