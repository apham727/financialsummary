The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation in its customer contracts or purchase orders. Most of the Company’s products have a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. Control is generally transferred at time of shipment when title and risk of ownership passes to the customer. For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices. Payment terms are typically within 30 to 90 days from the shipping date, depending on our terms with the customer. The Company offers standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations. 
On  July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09. “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective adoption method which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. This approach was applied to contracts that were not completed as of  June 30, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning  July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period. The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $591,000 on  July 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, as described below. 
In  February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after  December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the amended guidance will have on its financial statements.  
The Company’s corporate administration activities are reported in the Corporate and Eliminations line item. These activities primarily include intercompany profit in inventory eliminations, expense related to certain corporate officers and support staff, the Company’s internal audit staff, expense related to the Company’s Board of Directors, equity compensation expense for various equity awards granted to corporate administration employees, certain consulting expenses, investor relations activities, and a portion of the Company’s legal, auditing and professional fee expenses. Corporate identifiable assets primarily consist of cash, invested cash (if any), refundable income taxes (if any), and deferred income taxes. 
The carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment. The Company  may first assess qualitative factors in order to determine if goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If through the qualitative assessment it is determined that it is more likely than not that goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not impaired, no further testing is required. If it is determined more likely than not that goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are impaired, or if the Company elects not to first assess qualitative factors, the Company’s impairment testing continues with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of a market approach and an income (discounted cash flow) approach, at the reporting unit level. The estimation of the fair value of reporting unit requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. The estimates of the fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could increase or decrease an impairment charge. Company management uses its judgment in assessing whether assets  may have become impaired between annual impairment tests. Indicators such as adverse business conditions, economic factors and technological change or competitive activities  may signal that an asset has become impaired. 
The Company paid cash dividends of $1,296,000 and $1,286,000 in the three months ended  September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Dividends on restricted stock units in the amount of $31,553 and $29,106 were accrued as of  September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These dividends will be paid upon the vesting of the restricted stock units when shares are issued to the award recipients. In  November 2018, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable  November 27, 2018 to shareholders of record as of  November 16, 2018. The indicated annual cash dividend rate is $0.20 per share. 
The Company’s equity compensation plan, the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (“the 2012 Plan”), was approved by shareholders in  November 2012. The 2012 Plan covers all of the Company’s full-time employees, outside directors and certain advisors and replaced all previous equity compensation plans. In  November 2016, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the 2012 Plan that added 1,600,000 shares to the plan and implemented the use of a fungible share ratio that consumes 2.5 available shares for every full value share awarded by the Company as stock compensation. The 2012 Plan allows for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock awards, performance stock units, and other stock-based awards. Stock option grants or stock awards made pursuant to the 2012 Plan are granted at fair market value at the date of option grant or stock award.  
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company granted Performance Stock Units (PSUs). PSUs are full value awards and consume the pool of available shares at the fungible rate of 2.5 for every full share awarded. The vesting of the PSUs is subject to the achievement of Return on Net Assets (RONA) and EBITDA objectives over a three year performance cycle. If certain one year performance objectives are met, one-third of the PSU’s will vest and be released. If the one year performance objectives are not met, the entire PSU awards may be earned over the remaining three-year performance cycle. 
The Company has a non-qualified deferred compensation plan providing for both Company contributions and participant deferrals of compensation. This plan is fully funded in a Rabbi Trust. All plan investments are in shares of common stock of the Company. The Company also awards its directors shares of common stock as part of their compensation. Stock compensation awards are made in the form of newly issued common shares of the Company.  
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company granted 422,900 serviced-based stock options with an exercise price of $4.94 and 134,350 PSUs at a fair value of $4.94. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company granted 724,037 service-based and performance-based stock options with an exercise price of $5.92 and 91,490 Restricted Stock Units with a fair value of $5.92.

On  April 23, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors announced the appointment of an interim Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Operating Officer in connection with the departure of Dennis Wells, the Company’s former CEO. The $1,772,000 severance liability reported as of  June 30, 2018 represents the severance benefits Mr. Wells is entitled to receive under his employment agreement. Of the total $1,575,000 reported as of  September 30, 2018, $590,000 has been classified as a current liability and will be paid out over the next twelve months. The remaining $985,000 has been classified as a long-term liability.

The restructuring charges consist primarily of transportation costs to move inventory to Blue Ash, the impairment of equipment, costs to restore the leased facility, and severance benefits. The Company also incurred $435,000 related to the write-down of inventory which is not included in the table below. All restructuring costs are reported in cost of sales in the Lighting Segment.

Fiscal 2019 first quarter operating income of $2.9 million increased $27.7 million from an operating loss of $(24,814,000) in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The $27.7 million change from an operating loss in fiscal 2018 to operating income in fiscal 2019 was mostly the result of a pre-tax $28 million goodwill impairment charge in the Lighting Segment in fiscal 2018. Adjusted fiscal 2019 operating income of $3.5 million (which reflects the removal of plant closure costs) increased 10.6% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $3.2 (which reflects the removal of the goodwill impairment). Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. The increase in adjusted operating income was the result of decreased net sales and decreased gross profit more than offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses. Also contributing to the period-over-period results is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million. 
On October 29, 2018, The Company announced that it will permanently close its New Windsor, New York manufacturing facility. The facility manufactures indoor lighting products and is included in the results of the Lighting Segment. Production will be transferred to the Company’s Erlanger, Kentucky and Blue Ash, Ohio facilities, also included in the Lighting Segment. The New Windsor facility has a workforce of 140 employees. The closure is part of ongoing actions to align the Company’s supply chain to more cost effectively serve the changing requirements of the lighting market. The closure will also allow the Company to improve utilization of existing manufacturing capacity. The transfer of production is expected to be completed by June 30, 2019. 
Lighting Segment net sales of $61,432,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 10.2% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $68,428,000. The Lighting Segment’s net sales of light fixtures having solid-state LED technology totaled $49.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 which represent 91% of total lighting product net sales. There continues to be a reduction in the Company’s traditional lighting sales (metal halide and fluorescent light sources) as customers convert from traditional lighting to light fixtures having solid-state LED technology.  
Administrative expenses of $3,307,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased slightly from the same period of the prior year. The change is primarily the result of a decrease in employee compensation and benefit expense ($0.6 million) offset by an equal an increase in outside service expense ($0.4 million), and a net increase in various other expense categories ($0.2 million). 
The Company reported $518,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $403,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The change from interest expense from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is the result of higher interest rates on the Company’s line of credit and higher commitment fees on its unused portion of the line of credit. 
The Company considers its level of cash on hand, borrowing capacity, current ratio and working capital levels to be its most important measures of short-term liquidity. For long-term liquidity indicators, the Company believes its ratio of long-term debt to equity and its historical levels of net cash flows from operating activities to be the most important measures. 
At September 30, 2018, the Company had working capital of $72.6 million, compared to $67.9 million at June 30, 2018. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.59 to 1 as compared to a ratio of 2.61 to 1 at June 30, 2018. The $4.7 million increase in working capital from June 30, 2018 to September 30, 2018 was primarily related to the net effect of increased cash and cash equivalents ($1.0 million), increased net accounts receivable ($9.2 million), decreased net inventory ($1.4 million), an increase in accrued expenses ($2.3 million), a decrease in refundable income taxes ($0.6 million), and an increase in accounts payable ($5.8 million). The $4.1 million of the increase in accounts receivable is the result of the adoption of the new revenue guidance. The Company has a strategy of aggressively managing working capital, including reduction of the accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) and reduction of inventory levels, without reducing service to its customers. 
The Company generated $2.2 million of cash from operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to a use of cash of $2.7 million in the same period of the prior year. This $4.9 million increase in net cash flows from operating activities is primarily the net result of an increase rather than a decrease in accounts payable (favorable change of $7.3 million), a smaller increase in net accounts receivable (favorable change of $1.2 million), an increase rather than a decrease in net inventory (unfavorable change of $4.2 million), a smaller decrease in refundable income taxes (favorable change of $0.2 million), an increase in customer prepayments (favorable change of $0.4 million), and an increase in net income in fiscal 2019 from a net loss in fiscal 2018 offset by several non-cash add-backs (favorable change of $0.4 million). 
Net inventories of $49.6 million at September 30, 2018 decreased $1.4 million from $51.0 million at June 30, 2018. The decrease of $1.4 million is the result of a decrease in gross inventory of $0.9 million and an increase in obsolescence reserves of $0.5 million. Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory increased 1.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in the Graphics Segment which was more than offset by a decrease in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $3.2 million. 
Cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the Company’s line of credit is the Company’s primary source of liquidity. The Company has a secured $100 million revolving line of credit with its bank, with $46.1 million of the credit line available as of October 29, 2018. This line of credit is a $100 million five year credit line expiring in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company believes that its $100 million line of credit plus cash flows from operating activities are adequate for the Company’s fiscal 2019 operational and capital expenditure needs. The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants. 
In November 2018, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable November 27, 2018 to shareholders of record as of November 16, 2018. The indicated annual cash dividend rate for fiscal 2019 is $0.20 per share. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy regarding dividends which indicates that dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion based upon its evaluation of earnings, cash flow requirements, financial condition, debt levels, stock repurchases, future business developments and opportunities, and other factors deemed relevant. 
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company has not yet determined the impact the amended guidance will have on its financial statements.
