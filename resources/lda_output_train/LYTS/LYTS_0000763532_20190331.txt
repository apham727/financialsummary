A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Significant changes to our accounting policies as a result of adopting ASU-2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) are discussed below. 
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation in its customer contracts or purchase orders. Most of the Company’s products have a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. Control is generally transferred at time of shipment when title and risk of ownership passes to the customer. For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices. Payment terms are typically within 30 to 90 days from the shipping date, depending on our terms with the customer. The Company offers standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations. 
Installation is a separate performance obligation, except for our digital signage products. For digital signage products, installation is not a separate performance obligation as the product and installation is the combined item promised in digital signage contracts. The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties. 
The Company disaggregates the revenue from contracts with customers by the timing of revenue recognition because the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, and timing of our revenue and cash flows. The table presents a reconciliation of the disaggregation by reportable segments. 
On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09. “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective adoption method which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. This approach was applied to contracts that were not completed as of June 30, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period. The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $591,000 on July 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, as described below. 
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company has an implementation team tasked with reviewing our lease obligations and determining the impact of the new standard to its financial statements. The Company will continue to evaluate the new standard’s impact to its financial statements.  
In April 2019, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its manufacturing facility in New Windsor, New York. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will receive approximately $12 million of gross proceeds related to the sale and expects to report a gain between $3 million to $5.5 million. The transaction is expected to close on or before June 30, 2019 subject to the final approval from the New Windsor town officials. 
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation within the cash flows from operating activities section and cash flows from financing activities section of the statement of cash flows. These reclassifications have no impact on net income or earnings per share.  
The segment net sales reported above represent sales to external customers. Segment operating income, which is used in management’s evaluation of segment performance, represents net sales less all operating expenses. Identifiable assets are those assets used by each segment in its operations. 
    (c)   Options to purchase 3,787,519 common shares and 1,945,348 common shares for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were not included in the computation of the three month diluted loss per share because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares. Additionally, options to purchase 3,702,031 common shares and 3,086,121 common shares for the nine months ended at March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were not included in the computation of the nine month diluted loss per share because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares. For the three months ended in March 31, 2019 and the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the effect of dilutive securities was not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share because there was a net loss for the period.    
A sustained and significant decline in the Company’s stock price in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 led management to believe that a triggering event occurred and that an interim goodwill impairment test was required for one of the reporting units in the Lighting Segment that contains goodwill, as of December 31, 2018. In accordance with ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” which was adopted in a prior period, the requirement to perform step 2 in the impairment test was not required. The result of the impairment test on the reporting unit in the Lighting Segment indicated that goodwill was impaired by $20,165,000. The Company will continue to monitor market conditions and other events that may result in a sustained and significant drop in its stock price which would require an interim goodwill impairment test. 
As of March 1, 2019, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on the two reporting units that contain goodwill. The preliminary goodwill impairment test on one reporting unit in the Lighting Segment passed with a business enterprise value that was $38.9 million or 54% above the carrying value of this reporting unit including goodwill. The preliminary goodwill impairment test of the reporting unit with goodwill in the Graphics Segment passed with an estimated business enterprise value that was $3.0 million or 297% above the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill. The definitive impairment test is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. It is anticipated that the results of the test will not change when the test is complete.

Fiscal 2019 third quarter net sales of $72,832,000 decreased $6.0 million or 8% as compared to third quarter fiscal 2018 net sales of $78,843,000. Net sales were favorably influenced by increased net sales of the Graphics Segment (up $2.8 million or 16%) more than offset by decreased net sales of the Lighting Segment (down $8.8 million or 14%). 
Fiscal 2019 first nine months net sales of $247,330,000 decreased $11.3 million or 4% as compared to first nine months fiscal 2018 net sales of $258,614,000. Net sales were favorably influenced by increased net sales of the Graphics Segment (up $10.0 million or 17%) more than offset by decreased net sales of the Lighting Segment (down $21.3 million or 11%). 
Lighting Segment net sales of $52,785,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $8.8 million or 14% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $61,554,000. The 14% drop in sales is attributed to continued competitiveness in the Company’s project and stock and flow markets. The Company also elected not to run any quarter-end promotional programs in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to several promotional programs which were conducted at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, the Company’s realignment of its sales organization and focus on market priorities were disruptive and contributed to the decline in third quarter sales.  
The Company reported $579,000 net interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $400,000 net interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The change in interest expense from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is the result of higher interest rates on the Company’s line of credit. The Company also recorded other expense of $183,000 in the third quarter related to net foreign currency transaction losses from transactions with its customers and suppliers through its Mexican subsidiary. 
The $133,000 income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a pre-tax loss is the result of a cumulative change to the Company’s estimated annual tax rate. The Company has announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its New Windsor, New York facility. The closing of the sale is expected in the fourth quarter and is expected to generate a gain resulting from the sale. This gain will be offset by a capital loss carryforward resulting in a tax benefit. This event was part of the calculation of the estimated annual income tax rate. The $123,000 income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 represents a consolidated effective tax rate of 35.9%. This is the net result of adjusting the Company’s year-to-date tax expense to an overall income tax rate of 28.9% influenced by the first quarter goodwill impairment and by certain permanent book-tax differences and adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions. 
The Company reported a net loss of $(3,168,000) in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to net income of $220,000 in the same period of the prior year. The change from net income in fiscal 2018 to a net loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 is the net result of decreased net sales, decreased gross profit, decreased selling and administrative expenses, and increased interest expense. Also impacting the period-over-period comparison is $368,000 of restructuring charges and $183,000 of net foreign currency transactions losses of which there were no comparable events in fiscal 2018. Diluted loss per share of $(0.12) was reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to $ 0.01 diluted earnings per share in the same period of fiscal 2018. The weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 were 26,132,000 shares as compared to 26,437,000 shares in the same period last year. 
The Lighting Segment first nine month fiscal 2019 operating loss of $(13,911,000) decreased $0.8 million from an operating loss of $(14,673,000) in the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a $20.2 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2019 compared to a $28.0 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2018. When the goodwill impairment charges are removed from both fiscal years along with the restructuring charges of $1,991,000 ($1,859,000 in cost of sales and $132,000 in selling and administrative expenses) and severance expense ($77,000 in cost of sales and $160,000 in selling and administrative expense) from the current fiscal year, fiscal 2019 adjusted operating income of $8,482,000 was $4.9 million lower than fiscal 2018 adjusted operating income of $13,335,000. The reduction in sales volume and gross profit was partially offset by lower selling and administrative expenses. 
The Company reported $1,712,000 net interest expense in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to $1,220,000 net interest expense in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The change in interest expense from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is the result of higher interest rates on the Company’s line of credit. The Company also recorded other expense of $183,000 in the third quarter related to net foreign currency transaction losses from transactions with its customers and suppliers through its Mexican subsidiary. 
The $4,304,000 income tax benefit in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 represents a consolidated effective tax rate of 20.0%, which is inclusive of a cumulative change to the estimated annual tax rate mostly due to the tax treatment related to the fourth quarter sale of its New Windsor, New York facility. The Company has announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its New Windsor, New York facility. The closing of the sale is expected in the fourth quarter and is expected to generate a gain resulting from the sale. This gain will be offset by a capital loss carryforward resulting in a tax benefit. Also impacting the consolidated tax benefit is the second quarter goodwill impairment charge and a 30% tax rate on taxable income from pre-tax profits recognized by the Company’s Mexican subsidiary. The $3,867,000 tax benefit in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 represents a consolidated effective rate of 18.6%. This is the net result of an overall income tax rate of 28.9% influenced by the first quarter goodwill impairment, by the second quarter $4.7 million tax adjustment related to the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets, and by certain permanent book-tax differences and adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions. 
The Company reported a net loss of $(17,201,000) in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to net loss of $(16,877,000) in the same period of the prior year. The increase in the net loss from fiscal 2018 to the net loss in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 is mostly driven by decreased net sales, decreased gross profit, decreased selling and administrative expenses, increased interest expense, and a larger tax benefit. Diluted loss per share of $(0.66) was reported in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 as compared to $(0.65) diluted loss per share in the same period of fiscal 2018. The weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 were 26,083,000 shares as compared to 25,835,000 shares in the same period last year. 
The Company considers its level of cash on hand, borrowing capacity, current ratio and working capital levels to be its most important measures of short-term liquidity. For long-term liquidity indicators, the Company believes its ratio of long-term debt to equity and its historical levels of net cash flows from operating activities to be the most important measures. 
At March 31, 2019 the Company had working capital of $68.3 million, compared to $67.9 million at June 30, 2018. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.59 to 1 as compared to a ratio of 2.61 to 1 at June 30, 2018. The $0.4 million increase in working capital from June 30, 2018 to March 31, 2019 was primarily related to the net effect of decreased cash and cash equivalents ($1.5 million), increased net accounts receivable ($1.5 million), increased net inventory ($0.6 million), a decrease in accrued expenses ($2.1 million), a decrease in refundable income taxes ($0.3 million), an increase on other current assets ($0.6 million), and an increase in accounts payable ($2.7 million). Of the $1.5 million increase in accounts receivable, $4.6 million of the total increase is attributed to the adoption of the new revenue guidance. The Company proactively manages its working capital, including reduction of the accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) and reduction of inventory levels, without reducing service to its customers. 
The Company generated $6.4 million of cash from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 as compared to a source of cash of $7.9 million in the same period of the prior year. This $1.5 million decrease in net cash flows from operating activities is primarily the net result of an increase rather than a decrease in accounts payable (favorable change of $5.8 million), a decrease rather than an increase in net accounts receivable (favorable change of $3.7 million), a greater increase in net inventory (unfavorable change of $4.0 million), a greater decrease in accrued expenses and other (unfavorable change of $1.3 million), and an increase in net loss from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 along with unfavorable change of non-cash add-backs to the change in net loss (unfavorable change of $6.1 million). 
Net inventories of $51.6 million at March 31, 2019 increased $0.6 million from $51.0 million at June 30, 2018. The increase of $0.6 million is the result of an increase in gross inventory of $1.5 million and an increase in obsolescence reserves of $0.9 million. Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory increased $3.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 in the Graphics Segment which was partially offset by a decrease in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $3.0 million. 
Cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the Company’s line of credit is the Company’s primary source of liquidity. The Company has a secured $75 million revolving line of credit with its bank, with $30.6 million of the credit line available as of April 14, 2019. (The Company amended its revolving line of credit in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and reduced its available line of credit from $100 million to $75 million in order to better match its financing needs with an appropriate borrowing capacity.) This line of credit is a $75 million five-year credit line expiring in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company believes that its $75 million line of credit plus cash flows from operating activities are adequate for the Company’s fiscal 2019 operational and capital expenditure needs. The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants.
