Depending upon geographic location, after shipment, a machine may be installed at the customer’s facilities by a distributor, independent contractor or by one of our service technicians.
We consider the machine installation process for our three-axis machines to be inconsequential and perfunctory.
We recognize installation revenue on a prorata basis over the period of the installation process.
