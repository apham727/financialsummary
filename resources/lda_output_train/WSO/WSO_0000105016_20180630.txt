The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this report include the accounts of Watsco, all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of three joint ventures with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), in each of which Watsco maintains a controlling interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
The results of operations for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2018. Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment, and parts and supplies are seasonal. Furthermore, results of operations can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on weather patterns, primarily during the Summer and Winter selling seasons. Demand related to the residential central air conditioning replacement market is typically highest in the second and third quarters, and demand for heating equipment is usually highest in the fourth quarter. Demand related to the new construction market is generally evenly distributed throughout the year, subject to weather and economic conditions, including their effect on the number of housing completions.  
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued a standard on revenue recognition that provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. The standard is principle-based and provides a five-step model to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. In 2015 and 2016, the FASB issued several updates to this standard. The adoption of this standard and its related amendments (collectively, the New Revenue Standard) on January 1, 2018 did not result in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings under the modified retrospective approach, nor did it have a significant impact on our consolidated net income, balance sheet or cash flow. See Note 2.  
In May 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. This guidance must be applied prospectively and became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for hedging derivatives. This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We elected to adopt this guidance during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases. We will apply this guidance using a modified retrospective approach, and it will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Based on our preliminary assessment of our lease portfolio, we expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. However, we do not expect a material impact on our consolidated statements of income. We are in the process of collecting data and designing processes and controls to account for our leases in accordance with the new guidance. Our current minimum lease commitments are disclosed in Note 16 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  
In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this updated standard, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. An entity also should consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if any. This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
We adopted the New Revenue Standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. The New Revenue Standard did not have an impact on the amount and timing of our revenue recognition; however, certain payments to customers were reclassified from expense to a reduction from revenues, resulting in an immaterial impact to the individual financial statement line items of our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income. Results for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2018 are presented under the New Revenue Standard, while prior period results have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.  
 obligation under such contracts when we transfer control of the product to the customer. Some contracts contain a combination of product sales and services, the latter of which is distinct and accounted for as a separate performance obligation. We satisfy our performance obligations for services when we render the services within the agreed-upon service period. Total service revenue is not material and accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated revenues for both the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018.  
We estimate sales incentives expected to be paid over the term of the program based on the most likely amount. Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction in the transaction price and are generally paid on an annual basis. Accrued sales incentives of $11,600 and $13,001 as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets.  
We maintain an unsecured, syndicated revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases and issuances of letters of credit. Effective February 5, 2018, we decreased the borrowing capacity under this credit agreement from $600,000 to $300,000. Included in the credit facility are a $90,000 swingline subfacility, a $10,000 letter of credit subfacility and a $75,000 multicurrency borrowing sublimit. The credit agreement matures on July 1, 2019.  
At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $141,600 and $21,800, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants with respect to consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, and other customary restrictions. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2018.  
On February 13, 2017, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise Northeast LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise II, for cash consideration of $42,688, which increased our controlling interest from 70% to 80%. Carrier Enterprise II was formed in 2011 as a joint venture with Carrier. Carrier Enterprise II had sales of approximately $545,000 in 2017 from 40 locations in the northeastern United States and 14 locations in Mexico.  
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement of these derivatives results in reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings for the period in which the settlement of these instruments occurs. The maximum period for which we hedge our cash flow using these instruments is 12 months. Accordingly, at June 30, 2018, all of our open foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of one year or less. The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at June 30, 2018 was $31,700, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through March 2019.  
During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018, 12,924 shares of Common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $2,213 were withheld as payment in lieu of cash to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of non-vested restricted stock. These shares were retired upon delivery. During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017, 20,100 shares of Common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $2,771 were withheld as payment in lieu of cash to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of non-vested restricted stock. These shares were retired upon delivery.

In 2009, we formed a joint venture with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, in which Carrier contributed 95 of its company-owned locations in 13 Sun Belt states and Puerto Rico, and its export division in Miami, Florida, and we contributed 15 locations that distributed Carrier products. In July 2012, we exercised our option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased our ownership interest to 70%; and, on July 1, 2014, we exercised our last remaining option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased our controlling interest to 80%. Neither Watsco nor Carrier has any remaining options to purchase additional ownership interests in Carrier Enterprise I or any of our other joint ventures with Carrier, which are described below.  
Revenues for the second quarter of 2018 increased $56.8 million, or 5%, including $6.0 million from locations opened during the preceding 12 months, offset by $3.2 million from locations closed. On a same-store basis, revenues increased $54.0 million, or 4%, as compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting a 6% increase in sales of HVAC equipment (68% of sales), which included a 6% increase in residential HVAC equipment and a 5% increase in commercial HVAC equipment, a 5% increase in sales of other HVAC products (28% of sales) and a 1% increase in sales of commercial refrigeration products (4% of sales). The increase in same-store revenues was primarily due to demand for the replacement of residential and commercial HVAC equipment. Revenues from sales of residential HVAC equipment also benefited from an improved sales mix of higher-efficiency air conditioning and heating systems, which sell at higher unit prices.  
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2018 increased $5.6 million, or 3%, primarily due to increased revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 decreased to 14.0% versus 14.2% for the same period in 2017. On a same-store basis, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% as compared to the same period in 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses included $0.7 million of additional costs for 2018 in excess of 2017 for ongoing technology initiatives.  
Net income attributable to Watsco for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 increased $16.2 million, or 22%, compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenues, expanded operating margin, lower interest expense, net, and lower income taxes as discussed above.  
Revenues for the first half of 2018 increased $111.3 million, or 5%, including $10.6 million from locations opened during the preceding 12 months, offset by $6.5 million from locations closed. On a same-store basis, revenues increased $107.2 million, or 5%, as compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting a 6% increase in sales of HVAC equipment (67% of sales), which included a 7% increase in residential HVAC equipment and a 5% increase in commercial HVAC equipment, a 6% increase in sales of other HVAC products (29% of sales) and flat sales of commercial refrigeration products (4% of sales). The increase in same-store revenues was primarily due to strong demand for the replacement of residential and commercial HVAC equipment. Revenues from sales of residential HVAC equipment also benefited from an improved sales mix of higher-efficiency air conditioning and heating systems, which sell at higher unit prices.  
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first half of 2018 increased $14.3 million, or 4%, primarily due to increased revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2018 decreased to 16.2% versus 16.3% for the same period in 2017. On a same-store basis, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4% as compared to the same period in 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses included $1.0 million of additional costs for 2018 in excess of 2017 for ongoing technology initiatives.  
Net income attributable to Watsco for the first half of 2018 increased $24.2 million, or 24%, compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenues, expanded operating margin, lower interest expense, net, and lower income taxes as discussed above.  
We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand, and funds available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that our current sources of available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements.  
We maintain an unsecured, syndicated revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases, and issuances of letters of credit. Effective February 5, 2018, we decreased the borrowing capacity under this credit agreement from $600.0 million to $300.0 million. Included in the credit facility are a $90.0 million swingline subfacility, a $10.0 million letter of credit subfacility and a $75.0 million multicurrency borrowing sublimit. The credit agreement matures on July 1, 2019. We believe we will refinance the credit agreement at or prior to its maturity on similar terms and subject to similar conditions.  
At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $141.6 million and $21.8 million were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement, respectively. The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants with respect to consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, and other customary restrictions. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2018.  
Additionally, at June 30, 2018, $1.5 million of short-term borrowings were outstanding under a credit line established by our Mexican subsidiary. This line of credit has a one-year term, maturing on June 12, 2019, is non-committed and provides for borrowings of up to approximately $3.8 million (MXN 75.0 million) for general corporate purposes. No short-term borrowings were outstanding under this credit line at December 31, 2017.  
We paid cash dividends of $2.70 and $2.10 per share of both Common stock and Class B common stock during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. On July 2, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $1.45 per share of both Common and Class B common stock that is payable on July 31, 2018 to shareholders of record as of July 17, 2018.  
In September 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, at managements discretion, of up to 7,500,000 shares of common stock in the open market or via private transactions. Shares repurchased under the program are accounted for using the cost method and result in a reduction of shareholders equity. No shares were repurchased during the quarters ended June 30, 2018 or  
2017. In aggregate, 6,370,913 shares of Common and Class B common stock have been repurchased at a cost of $114.4 million since the inception of the program. At June 30, 2018, there were 1,129,087 shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the program.
