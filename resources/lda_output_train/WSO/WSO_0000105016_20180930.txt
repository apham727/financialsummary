The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this report include the accounts of Watsco, all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of three joint ventures with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), in each of which Watsco maintains a controlling interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The guidance requires the use of a modified retrospective approach to apply the standard at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements. In July 2018, updated guidance was issued which provides an additional transition method of adoption that allows entities to initially apply the standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We will adopt the guidance on January 1, 2019 using this additional transition method and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.  
In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this updated standard, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. An entity also should consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if any. This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
We adopted the New Revenue Standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. The New Revenue Standard did not have an impact on the amount or timing of our revenue recognition; however, certain payments to customers were reclassified from expenses to a reduction from revenues, resulting in an immaterial impact to the individual financial statement line items of our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income. Results for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2018 are presented under the New Revenue Standard, while prior period results have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.  
We maintain an unsecured, syndicated revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases and issuances of letters of credit. Effective February 5, 2018, we decreased the borrowing capacity under this revolving credit agreement from $600,000 to $300,000. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $116,400 and $21,800, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. The credit agreement matures on July 1, 2019 and, accordingly,  
 borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement are classified as current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet at September 30, 2018. We believe that we will refinance the credit agreement at or prior to its maturity on similar terms and subject to similar conditions.  
On February 13, 2017, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise Northeast LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise II, for cash consideration of $42,688, which increased our controlling interest from 70% to 80%. Carrier Enterprise II was formed in 2011 as a joint venture with Carrier. Carrier Enterprise II had sales of approximately $545,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 40 locations in the northeastern United States and 14 locations in Mexico.  
On June 21, 2017, our first joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise, LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, acquired an approximately 35% ownership interest in Russell Sigler, Inc. (RSI), an HVAC distributor with 2017 sales of approximately $680,000, operating from 30 locations in the Western U.S. We have an 80% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise I, and Carrier has a 20% non-controlling interest. Carrier Enterprise I acquired its ownership interest in RSI for cash consideration of $63,600, of which we contributed $50,880, and Carrier contributed $12,720. Effective June 29, 2018, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an additional 1.4% ownership interest in RSI, which increased Carrier Enterprise Is ownership interest in RSI to 36.3%. Total cash consideration of $3,760 was paid on July 5, 2018, of which we contributed $3,008 and Carrier contributed $752. Carrier Enterprise I is a party to a shareholders agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) with RSI and its shareholders. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, RSIs shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on either book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price paid for its investment in RSI. RSIs shareholders may transfer their respective shares of RSI common stock only to members of the Sigler family or to Carrier Enterprise I, and, at any time from and after the date on which Carrier Enterprise I owns 85% or more of RSIs outstanding common stock, it has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from RSIs shareholders the remaining outstanding shares of RSI common stock. Additionally, Carrier Enterprise I has the right to appoint two of RSIs six board members. Given Carrier Enterprise Is 36.3% ownership interest in RSI and its right to appoint two out of RSIs six board members, this investment in RSI is accounted for under the equity method.  
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement of these derivatives results in reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings for the period in which the settlement of these instruments occurs. The maximum period for which we hedge our cash flow using these instruments is 12 months. Accordingly, at September 30, 2018, all of our open foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of one year or less. The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at September 30, 2018 was $36,800, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through June 2019.  
The following table summarizes the fair value of derivative instruments, which consist solely of foreign exchange contracts, included in other current assets and accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets. See Note 10.  
Derivative financial instruments  these derivatives are foreign currency forward and option contracts. See Note 9. Fair value is based on observable market inputs, such as forward rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivatives within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  
During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2017, we sold 35,000 shares of Common stock under the ATM Program for net proceeds of $5,391. Direct costs of $285 incurred in connection with the offering were charged against the proceeds from the sale of Common stock and reflected as a reduction of paid-in capital. At September 30, 2017, $244,560 remained available for sale under the Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, we had completed the offering of shares under the ATM Program. The net proceeds were primarily used to repay outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes.  
During the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, 8,830, 12,354, 21,754 and 32,454 shares of Common stock, respectively, with aggregate fair market values of $1,562, $1,893, $3,775 and $4,664, respectively, were withheld as payment in lieu of cash to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of non-vested restricted stock. These shares were retired upon delivery.  
During the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, 8,600, 9,084, 53,184 and 25,084 stock options, respectively, were exercised for Common stock. Cash received from common stock issued as a result of stock options exercised during the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, was $856, $801, $4,837 and $2,111, respectively.  
During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2018, 376 shares of Common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $69 and 7,027 shares of Common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $1,269, respectively, were withheld as payment in lieu of cash for stock option exercises and related tax withholdings. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2017, 350 shares of Common stock with an aggregate fair market value of $53 were withheld as payment in lieu of cash for stock option exercises and related tax withholdings. These shares were retired upon delivery.

In 2009, we formed a joint venture with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, in which Carrier contributed 95 of its company-owned locations in 13 Sun Belt states and Puerto Rico, and its export division in Miami, Florida, and we contributed 15 locations that distributed Carrier products. In July 2012, we exercised our option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased our ownership interest to 70%; and, on July 1, 2014, we exercised our last remaining option to acquire an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise I, which increased our controlling interest to 80%. Neither Watsco nor Carrier has any remaining options to purchase additional ownership interests in Carrier Enterprise I or any of our other joint ventures with Carrier, which are described below.  
Our critical accounting policies are included in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2018. We believe that there have been no significant changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2018 to the critical accounting policies disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  
Revenues for the third quarter of 2018 increased $66.4 million, or 5%, including $3.4 million from locations opened and acquired during the preceding 12 months, offset by $3.8 million from locations closed. On a same-store basis, revenues increased $66.8 million, or 5%, as compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting a 7% increase in sales of HVAC equipment (68% of sales), which included a 6% increase in residential HVAC equipment and a 9% increase in commercial HVAC equipment, a 4% increase in sales of other HVAC products (28% of sales) and flat sales of commercial refrigeration products (4% of sales). The increase in same-store revenues was primarily due to realization of price increases, demand for the replacement of residential and commercial HVAC equipment and a higher mix of high-efficiency air conditioning and heating systems, which sell at higher unit prices.  
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2018 increased $16.7 million, or 9%, primarily due to increased revenues, additional sales and service-related headcount and an increase in performance-based compensation specific to certain markets. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased to 15.5% versus 14.9% for the same period in 2017. On a same-store basis, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9% as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to our inability to leverage fixed operating costs to the same extent as in 2017.  
Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $177.7 million, or 5%, including $14.0 million from locations opened and acquired during the preceding 12 months, offset by $10.3 million from locations closed. On a same-store basis, revenues increased $174.0 million, or 5%, as compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting a 7% increase in sales of HVAC equipment (68% of sales), which included a 7% increase in residential HVAC equipment and a 6% increase in commercial HVAC equipment, a 5% increase in sales of other HVAC products (28% of sales) and flat sales of commercial refrigeration products (4% of sales). The increase in same-store revenues was primarily due to realization of price increases and demand for the replacement of residential and commercial HVAC equipment. Revenues from sales of residential HVAC equipment also benefited from an improved sales mix of higher-efficiency air conditioning and heating systems, which sell at higher unit prices.  
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $31.0 million, or 6%, primarily due to increased revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased to 15.9% versus 15.8% for the same period in 2017. On a same-store basis, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to our inability to leverage fixed operating costs to the same extent as in 2017.  
We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand, and funds available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that our current sources of available funds will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements. While we have the intent and current ability to refinance our revolving credit agreement on similar terms and subject to similar conditions on a long-term basis prior to its maturity in 2019, there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance with the same terms and conditions.  
The individual items contributing to cash flow changes for the periods presented are detailed in the condensed consolidated unaudited statements of cash flows contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the timing of payments for accrued expenses and other current liabilities and higher accounts receivable driven by increased sales volume, partially offset by a lower increase in inventory and higher net income in the 2018 period.  
Net cash used in investing activities was lower due to the purchase of an ownership interest in RSI for $63.6 million in 2017, partially offset by an acquisition for cash consideration of $5.9 million and the purchase of an additional ownership interest in RSI for $3.8 million in 2018.  
We maintain an unsecured, syndicated revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases, and issuances of letters of credit. Effective February 5, 2018, we decreased the borrowing capacity under this revolving credit agreement from $600.0 million to $300.0 million. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $116.4 million and $21.8 million were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement, respectively. The credit agreement matures on July 1, 2019 and accordingly, borrowings outstanding are classified as current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet at September 30, 2018. We believe that we will refinance the credit agreement at or prior to its maturity on similar terms and subject to similar conditions.  
On February 13, 2017, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II for cash consideration of $42.7 million, which increased our controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise II to 80%. We used borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to finance this acquisition.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that are, among other things, designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Senior Vice President (SVP) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure and appropriate SEC filings.
