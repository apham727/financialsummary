Under U.S. GAAP, an entity must separately account for the debt component and the embedded conversion option of convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash or in shares of common stock upon conversion, such as our New Senior Convertible Notes, in a manner that reflects the issuerâ€™s effective interest cost.As of September 28, 2019, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $1.1 billion, compared to $819 million outstanding as of December 31, 2018.
