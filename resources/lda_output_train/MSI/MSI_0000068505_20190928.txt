The accounting for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash or in shares of common stock could have a material effect on our reported financial results. 
Under U.S. GAAP, an entity must separately account for the debt component and the embedded conversion option of convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash or in shares of common stock upon conversion, such as our New Senior Convertible Notes, in a manner that reflects the issuer’s effective interest cost. The fair value of the embedded conversion option is classified as an addition to stockholder’s equity. The difference between book carrying cost and face value of the debt represents a non-cash discount. This difference will be amortized into interest expense over the estimated life of the New Senior Convertible Notes using the effective yield method. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discount over the term of the New Senior Convertible Notes. Accordingly, we will report lower net income because of the recognition of both the current period’s discount amortization and the New Senior Convertible Notes’ coupon interest, which could adversely affect the trading price of our shares of common stock and the trading price (if any) of the New Senior Convertible Notes.

On September 5, 2019, we extended our strategic partnership with Silver Lake with new $1.0 billion 1.75% senior convertible notes. In exchange, we settled the outstanding $800 million 2.00% senior convertible notes with the issuance of 5.5 million shares and $1.1 billion in cash, of which, $600 million was paid subsequent to quarter end.
On March 11, 2019, we announced that we acquired Avtec, Inc. ("Avtec"), a provider of dispatch communication equipment for U.S. public safety and commercial customers for a purchase price of $136 million in cash, net of cash acquired. This acquisition expands our commercial portfolio with new capabilities, allowing us to offer an enhanced platform for customers to communicate, coordinate resources, and secure their facilities. 
On January 7, 2019, we announced that we acquired VaaS International Holdings ("VaaS"), a company that is a global provider of data and image analytics for vehicle location for $445 million, inclusive of share-based compensation withheld at a fair value of $38 million that will be expensed over an average service period of one year. The acquisition was settled with $231 million of cash, net of cash acquired, and 1.4 million of shares issued at a fair value of $160 million for a purchase price of $391 million.
On March 28, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Avigilon Corporation ("Avigilon"), a provider of advanced security and video solutions including video analytics, network video management hardware and software, video cameras and access control solutions for a purchase price of $974 million in cash, net of cash acquired, debt assumed, and transaction costs paid.
On March 7, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Plant Holdings, Inc. ("Plant"), the parent company of Airbus DS Communications for a purchase price of $237 million in cash, net of cash acquired.

The Products and Systems Integration segment’s net sales represented 68% of our consolidated net sales in the third quarter of 2019 and 69% in the third quarter of 2018. The Services and Software segment’s net sales represented 32% of our consolidated net sales in the third quarter of 2019 and 31% in the third quarter of 2018.
The reduction of Other charges in the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the third quarter of 2018 is primarily due to a $57 million environmental reserve expense that was recorded in the third quarter of 2018 and $15 million of net reorganization of business charges in the third quarter of 2019 as compared to $21 million in the third quarter of 2018 (see further detail in “Reorganization of Businesses” section).
The Products and Systems Integration segment’s net sales represented 66% of our consolidated net sales in the first nine months of 2019 and 67% in the first nine months of 2018. The Services and Software segment’s net sales represented 34% of our consolidated net sales in the first nine months of 2019 and 33% in the first nine months of 2018.
Net gains on sales of investments and businesses were $4 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $16 million during the first nine months of 2018. The net gains in the first nine months of 2019 were related to the sale of our two-way communications rental business and various equity method investments. The net gains in the first nine months of 2018 were primarily related to the sale of two investments. 
Cash payments for employee severance in connection with the reorganization of business plans were $44 million in the first nine months of 2019 and employee severance costs were $48 million in the first nine months of 2018. The reorganization of business accrual at September 28, 2019 was $77 million, of which relate to employee separation costs that are expected to be paid within one year.
In February of 2018, we issued $500 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2028. After debt issuance costs and debt discounts, we recognized net proceeds of $497 million. These proceeds were then used to make a $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan in the first quarter of 2018. During the second half of 2018, we issued an additional $200 million on the outstanding 4.6% senior notes bringing the total outstanding principal to $700 million. We recognized net proceeds of $196 million after debt issuance costs and debt discounts, which was then used to pay the $200 million principal due to Silver Lake Partners on October 15, 2018.
In August of 2019, we issued a follow-on $150 million to the outstanding 4.60% senior notes due 2029 bringing the outstanding total to $800 million. We recognized net proceeds of $159 million after debt premiums and debt issuance costs. These proceeds were then used to repurchase the remaining $150 million principal amount of the 3.5% senior notes due 2021 for a purchase price of $155 million, excluding approximately $2 million of accrued interest. After accelerating the amortization of debt issuance costs, we recognized a loss of approximately $7 million related to this repurchase in Other, net within Other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
On September 5, 2019, we entered into an agreement with Silver Lake Partners to issue $1.0 billion of 1.75% senior convertible notes which mature in September 2024 ("New Senior Convertible Notes"). Interest on these notes is payable semiannually. The notes are convertible anytime on or after two years from their issuance date, except in certain limited circumstances. The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 4.9140 per $1,000 principal amount (which is equal to an initial conversion price of $203.50 per share). In the event of conversion, we intend to settle the principal amount of the New Senior Convertible Notes in cash. We recorded a debt liability associated with the New Senior Convertible Notes by determining the fair value of an equivalent debt instrument without a conversion option. Using a discount rate of 2.45%, which was determined based on a review of relevant market data, we calculated the debt liability to be $986 million, indicating a $14 million discount to be amortized over the expected life of the debt instrument. The remaining proceeds of $14 million were allocated to the conversion option and accordingly, increased Additional paid-in capital. 
As of September 28, 2019, we had a $2.2 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in April 2022 (the "2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement"). The 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a $500 million letter of credit sub-limit with $450 million of fronting commitments. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above LIBOR, at our option. An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if our credit rating changes. We must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with our financial covenants as of September 28, 2019. During the first quarter of 2018, we borrowed $400 million to facilitate the Avigilon acquisition, which was subsequently paid during the fourth quarter of 2018. There were no borrowings outstanding or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility as of September 28, 2019.
During the nine months ended September 28, 2019, we paid an aggregate of $170 million, including transaction costs, to repurchase approximately 1.4 million shares at an average price of $122.31 per share. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had used approximately $12.6 billion of the share repurchase authority to repurchase shares, leaving $1.4 billion of authority available for future repurchases.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20) - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans,” which modifies the disclosure requirements for the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans. The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2021 with early adoption permitted. The ASU requires a retrospective adoption method. We do not believe the ASU will have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. This was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-01, “Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842,” ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases,” and ASU No. 2018-11, “Targeted Improvements” (collectively "ASC 842"). ASC 842 establishes a right-of-use model ("ROU") that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with an initial term longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and presentation of expense recognition in the income statement.
ASC 842 provides for a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We elected the practical expedients, which permit us to not reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs under ASC 842. We did not elect the "use-of hindsight" practical expedient to determine the lease term or in assessing the likelihood that a lease purchase option will be exercised, allowing us to carry forward the lease term as determined prior to adoption of ASC 842. Finally, we also elected the practical expedient related to land easements, which enabled us to continue our accounting treatment for land easements on existing agreements as of January 1, 2019.
ASC 842 also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. A short-term lease is one with a term of 12 months or less, including any optional periods that are reasonably certain of exercise. For those leases that qualify, the exemption allows us to not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, including not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases at transition. Short-term lease costs are recognized as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term consistent with our prior accounting. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all current lease categories.

As of September 28, 2019, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $1.1 billion, compared to $819 million outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Management believes that these financial instruments should not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should generally offset gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions.

On January 3, 2019, as partial consideration for the acquisition of VaaS International Holdings ("VaaS"), a company that is a global provider of data and image analytics for vehicle location, we issued 1,802,379 shares of common stock the Company at a fair value of $198 million, inclusive of $38 million related to compensation withheld from the purchase that will be expensed over an average service period of one year, to certain of the former owners of VaaS.

The sale was completed in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Company relied on such exemption from registration based in part on representations made by the investment agreement with Silver Lake Partners.
On September 5, 2019, in connection with the agreement with Silver Lake Partners to settle a portion of the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes, the Company issued 5,471,271 million shares of common stock. These shares were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in a privately negotiated transaction not involving any public offering of solicitation. Subsequently, the shares were registered for resale by the selling securityholders pursuant to a registration statement filed on September 6, 2019. The selling securityholders will receive all of the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the shares of common stock. The Company will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the shares of common stock.
