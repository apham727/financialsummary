In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on a customerÂ’s accounting for implementation costs incurred in cloud-computing arrangements that are hosted by a vendor.
The new guidance expands the scope of financial instruments subject to impairment, including off-balance sheet commitments and residual value.
The company expects to elect the package of practical expedients not to reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs and the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components for all asset classes.
The company will make a policy election to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases for all asset classes.
A cross-functional implementation team is evaluating the lease portfolio, system, process, control and policy change requirements.
The company has made significant progress in these areas as well as in gathering the necessary data elements for the lease population.

In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance which addresses aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.
At adoption, $557 million was reclassified from notes and accounts receivable-trade and deferred income-current to prepaid expenses and other current assets to establish the opening balance for net contract assets.
In-scope sales commission costs previously recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings were capitalized in deferred costs in accordance with the transition guidance, in the amount of $737 million.
The company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2017, and it did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.
In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets, other than inventory, at the time of transfer.

The guidance was effective and adopted by the company on January 1, 2017, and it did not have a material impact in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
