We adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to contracts that were not substantially complete at the end of fiscal year 2018.
We recorded a $5.5 million adjustment to increase retained earnings to reflect the cumulative impact of adopting this standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2019, primarily related to certain long-term contracts our Filtration and Technical Packaging segments have that converted to the cost-to-cost method for revenue recognition.
Revenue is recognized when control of the goods or services promised under the contract is transferred to the customer either at a point in time (e.g., upon delivery) or over time (e.g., as we perform under the contract).
A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer and represents the unit of accounting for revenue recognition.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the expected consideration, or the transaction price, is allocated to each performance obligation identified in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation.
Revenue is then recognized for the transaction price allocated to the performance obligation when control of the promised goods or services underlying the performance obligation is transferred.
The contracts may contain multiple products, which are capable of being distinct as the customer could benefit from each product on its own or together with other readily available resources.
Selecting the method to measure progress towards completion for the commercial and military contracts requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or service to be provided.
Total contract cost is estimated utilizing current contract specifications and expected engineering requirements.
Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals.The decrease in net earnings and diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to the $25.1 million net tax benefit the Company recorded in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017.
Net sales increased $9.1 million, or 5.2%, to $182.6 million in the first quarter of 2019 from $173.5 million in the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to net sales increases from Morgan Schaffer and the Vanguard Instruments product line and new products and software solutions at Doble partially offset by a decrease in net sales at NRG due to softness in the renewable energy market.
The Company received new orders totaling $198.1 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $200.5 million in the first quarter of 2018.
Of the new orders received in the first quarter of 2019, $83.7 million related to Filtration products, $45.4 million related to Test products, $52.0 million related to USG products, and $17.0 million related to Technical Packaging products.
Amortization expenses consist of amortization of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily software).
