The Company’s earnings from continuing operations and net earnings from continuing operations were 405% and 504% higher, respectively, in the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 and 219% and 270% higher, respectively, in the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period primarily as a result of higher sales, higher net interest income due to the elimination of interest expense as a result of the Company’s voluntary prepayment of long-term debt and a lower tax provision compared to last year’s comparable periods.
The Company’s gross profit from continuing operations in the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 was higher than its gross profit from continuing operations in the prior year’s comparable period, and the gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales for the Company’s worldwide operations in the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 increased to 29.8% from 27.9% in the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
The higher gross profit margins from continuing operations for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 were principally a result of higher sales, reduced salaried headcount, primarily through attrition, and the partially fixed nature of overhead expenses in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased by $526,000 during the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018, or by 21%, and decreased by $989,000 during the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, or by 14%, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, and these expenses, measured as percentages of sales from continuing operations, were 15.4% and 18.0%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to 24.5% and 23.7%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
The decreases in such expenses during the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 were primarily the result of lower payroll, travel and entertainment and stock option expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations included stock option expenses of $194,000 and $594,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, compared to stock option expenses of $234,000 and $709,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
Interest income decreased 46% and 51%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 primarily as a result of lower average balances of marketable securities held by the Company in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates.
During the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, the Company earned interest income principally from its investments, which consisted primarily of short-term instruments and money market funds.
The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and a gain of $2,945 realized on the sale of its New England Laminates Co., Inc. facility located in Newburgh, New York.
The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 39-week period ended November 25, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period, primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and higher sales, compared to last year’s comparable period, and a one-time litigation expense of $375,000 in the 39-week period ended November 26, 2017.
During the 2018 fiscal year, the Company consolidated its Nelco Products, Inc. Electronics Business Unit located in Fullerton, California and its Neltec, Inc. Electronics Business Unit located in Tempe, Arizona.
The restructuring expenses were $61,000 and $231,000 during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 25, 2018, respectively, and $360,000 and $4.4 million during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 26, 2017, respectively.
In the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.10 and $0.23, respectively, including, in both such periods, the tax benefit described above.
Of the $112.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at November 25, 2018, $3.7 million was owned by certain of the Company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries.
The decrease in working capital at November 25, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 was due principally to the decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by the increase in inventories and the decrease in accounts payable.
During the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, the Company's net earnings, before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of bond premium and changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $5.2 million.
