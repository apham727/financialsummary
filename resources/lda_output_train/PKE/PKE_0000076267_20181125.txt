The Company’s total net sales from continuing operations worldwide in the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018 increased to $12.9 million from $10.2 million in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017. The Company’s total net sales from continuing operations worldwide in the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 increased to $34.5 million from $30.3 million in the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017. The increase in sales was due to the ramping up of programs on which the Company’s materials are qualified. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased by $526,000 during the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018, or by 21%, and decreased by $989,000 during the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, or by 14%, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, and these expenses, measured as percentages of sales from continuing operations, were 15.4% and 18.0%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to 24.5% and 23.7%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017. The decreases in such expenses during the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 were primarily the result of lower payroll, travel and entertainment and stock option expenses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations included stock option expenses of $194,000 and $594,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, compared to stock option expenses of $234,000 and $709,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017. 
Interest and other income from continuing operations was $393,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, compared to $734,000 and $2.2 million, respectively, for last fiscal year's comparable periods. Interest income decreased 46% and 51%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018 primarily as a result of lower average balances of marketable securities held by the Company in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates. During the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, the Company earned interest income principally from its investments, which consisted primarily of short-term instruments and money market funds. 
The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 13 weeks ended November 25, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and a gain of $2,945 realized on the sale of its New England Laminates Co., Inc. facility located in Newburgh, New York. The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 39-week period ended November 25, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period, primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and higher sales, compared to last year’s comparable period, and a one-time litigation expense of $375,000 in the 39-week period ended November 26, 2017. 
During the 2018 fiscal year, the Company consolidated its Nelco Products, Inc. Electronics Business Unit located in Fullerton, California and its Neltec, Inc. Electronics Business Unit located in Tempe, Arizona. The restructuring expenses were $61,000 and $231,000 during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 25, 2018, respectively, and $360,000 and $4.4 million during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 26, 2017, respectively. 
In the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.10 and $0.23, respectively, including, in both such periods, the tax benefit described above. This compared to basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.02 and $0.06 in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, respectively. The net impact of the tax benefit described above increased basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.04 the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018. 
During the 39 weeks ended November 25, 2018, the Company's net earnings, before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of bond premium and changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $5.2 million. During the same 39-week period, the Company expended $399,000 for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, compared with $428,000 during the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017. The Company paid $6.1 million in cash dividends in each of the 39-week periods ended November 25, 2018 and November 26, 2017. 
The Company believes its financial resources will be sufficient, through the 12 months following the filing of this Form 10-Q Quarterly Report and for the foreseeable future thereafter, to provide for continued investment in working capital and property, plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes. The Company’s financial resources are also available for purchases of the Company's common stock, appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the Company's business including the recently announced expansion in Kansas.

The Company's contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as lease agreements, consist only of (i) operating lease commitments and (ii) commitments to purchase raw materials. The Company has no other long-term debt, capital lease obligations, unconditional purchase obligations or other long-term obligations, standby letters of credit, guarantees, standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments or contingent commitments, other than two standby letters of credit in the total amount of $980,000 to secure the Company's obligations under its workers' compensation insurance program. 
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. This guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and expands the related disclosure requirements. The new standard was originally scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. In August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date of this guidance for one year. With the delay, the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and the interim periods within those fiscal years, with an option to adopt the standard on the originally scheduled effective date. The Company has adopted the guidance effective February 26, 2018, the first day of the 2019 fiscal year, and the adoption of this guidance did not impact its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position or disclosures.
