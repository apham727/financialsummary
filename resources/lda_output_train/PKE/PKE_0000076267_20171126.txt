The Company's total net sales worldwide in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 were 1% and 4% lower, respectively, than in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016 principally as a result of lower sales of the Company’s printed circuit materials in Asia and North America, partially offset by higher sales of the Company’s aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies. The Company’s total net sales worldwide in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 were lower than such sales in the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017 primarily as a result of lower sales of the Company’s printed circuit materials in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017.  
The Company’s total net sales worldwide in the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 decreased to $26.1 million from $26.5 million in the 13 weeks ended November 27, 2016 primarily as a result of lower sales of the Company’s printed circuit materials products in Asia and North America, partially offset by higher sales of the Company’s aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies. The Company’s total net sales worldwide in the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 decreased to $83.4 million from $87.0 million in the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016 primarily as a result of lower sales of the Company’s printed circuit materials products in Asia and North America, partially offset by higher sales of the Company’s aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies.  
The Company’s total net sales of its aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies products were $10.2 million and $30.3 million, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, or 39% and 36%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in such periods, compared to $7.5 million and $24.0 million, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, or 28% of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in each such periods. The Company’s total net sales of its printed circuit materials products were $15.9 million and $53.1 million, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, or 61% and 64%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in such periods, compared to $19.0 million and $63.0 million, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, or 72% of the Company’s total net sales worldwide in each such periods.  
The Company's foreign sales were $9.6 million and $33.4 million, respectively, during the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, or 37% and 40%, respectively, of the Company's total net sales worldwide during such periods, compared with $13.4 million and $41.1 million, respectively, of foreign sales, or 51% and 47%, respectively, of total net sales worldwide during last fiscal year's comparable periods. The Company’s foreign sales during the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 26, 2017 decreased 28% and 19%, respectively, from the comparable 2016 fiscal year periods. The decreases in the 13-week and 39-week periods were primarily due to the lower sales in Asia described above.  
In the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017, the Company’s sales in North America, Asia and Europe were 63%, 28% and 9%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide compared to 49%, 41% and 10%, respectively, in the 13 weeks ended November 27, 2016. In the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, the Company’s sales in North America, Asia and Europe were 60%, 32% and 8%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide compared to 53%, 39% and 8%, respectively, in the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016. The Company’s sales in North America increased 27%, its sales in Asia decreased 32% and its sales in Europe decreased 15% in the 13-week period ended November 26, 2017 compared to the 13-week period ended November 27, 2016, and its sales in North America increased 9%, its sales in Asia decreased 21% and its sales in Europe decreased 10% in the 39-week period ended November 26, 2017 compared to the 39-week period ended November 27, 2016. The decreases in Asia and Europe were primarily due to declines in the Company’s sales of printed circuit materials. 
During the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 26, 2017, total net sales worldwide of high performance printed circuit materials were 92% and 93%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide of printed circuit materials compared to the 13-week and 39-week periods ended November 27, 2016, during which total net sales worldwide of high performance printed circuit materials were 94% and 93% respectively, of the Company’s total net sales worldwide of printed circuit materials. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $193,000 during the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017, or by 4%, and decreased by $1,084,000 during the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, or by 7%, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, and these expenses, measured as percentages of sales, was 18.4% and 16.7%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 compared to 17.4% and 17.3%, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016. The increase in such expenses during the 13 weeks ended November 26, 2017 were primarily the result of advisory fees of $190,000. The decrease in such expenses during the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 was primarily the result of lower payroll, profit sharing and stock option expenses. During the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses included the advisory fees mentioned above and a one-time litigation expense of $375,000. 
In the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $472,000 and $4,735,000, respectively, compared to $113,000 and $206,000, respectively, in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, in connection with the consolidation of the Company’s electronics Business Units in North America in the 2018 fiscal year and the closure, in a prior year, of its facility located in Newburgh, New York. 
For the reasons set forth above, the Company’s earnings from operations were $801,000 and $867,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, which included the aforementioned restructuring charges of $472,000 and $4.7 million, respectively, and the $375,000 litigation expense in the 39-week period, compared to $1.9 million and $7.4 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016, which included the aforementioned restructuring charges of $113,000 and $206,000, respectively.

Interest income increased 71% and 90%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017 primarily as a result of higher weighted average interest rates and larger average balances of marketable securities held by the Company in the 13 weeks and 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods. During the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, the Company earned interest income principally from its investments, which consisted primarily of short-term instruments and money market funds. 
Of the $241.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash at November 26, 2017, $233.0 million was owned by certain of the Company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operating activities through the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter after giving consideration to the repayment of the Company’s debt in January 2018, payment of income taxes on repatriated foreign earnings in January 2018 and the expected payment of a special dividend in February 2018. 
During the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, the Company's net earnings, before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of bond premium and changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $5.0 million. During the same 39 week period, the Company expended $703,000 for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, compared with $194,000 during the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016. The Company paid $6.1 million in cash dividends in each of the 39-week periods ended November 26, 2017 and November 27, 2016.  
The Company's contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as lease agreements, consist only of (i) operating lease commitments and (ii) commitments to purchase raw materials. The Company has no other long-term debt, capital lease obligations, unconditional purchase obligations or other long-term obligations, standby letters of credit, guarantees, standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments or contingent commitments, other than two standby letters of credit in the total amount of $1.0 million to secure the Company's obligations under its workers' compensation insurance program.  
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. This guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and expands the related disclosure requirements. The new standard was originally scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. In August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date of this guidance for one year. With the delay, the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, with an option to adopt the standard on the originally scheduled effective date. The Company has concluded that this new guidance will not have a significant impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position and disclosures.
