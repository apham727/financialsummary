The Company's total net sales from continuing operations in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 were $11.2 million and $21.6 million, respectively, compared to $11.4 million and $20.1 million in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017, respectively. 
The Company’s earnings from continuing operations and net earnings from continuing operations were 6% and 112% higher, respectively, in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017 primarily as a result of higher net interest income due to the elimination of interest expense as a result of the voluntary prepayment of long-term debt and a lower tax provision compared to last year’s comparable period. 
The Company’s earnings from continuing operations and net earnings from continuing operations were 116% and 184% higher, respectively, in the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period primarily as a result of higher sales, higher net interest income due to the elimination of interest expense as a result of the voluntary prepayment of long-term debt and a lower tax provision compared to last year’s comparable period. 
The Company’s total net sales from continuing operations worldwide in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 decreased to $11.2 million from $11.4 million in the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017. The Company’s total net sales from continuing operations worldwide in the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 increased to $21.6 million from $20.1 million in the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017. 
The Company’s gross profit from continuing operations in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 was lower than its gross profit from continuing operations in the prior year’s comparable period, and the gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales for the Company’s worldwide operations in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 decreased to 28.1% from 28.3% in the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017. The Company’s gross profit from continuing operations in the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 was higher than its gross profit from continuing operations in the prior year’s comparable period, and the gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales for the Company’s worldwide operations in the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 increased to 27.8% from 27.4% in the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017. The lower gross profit margin from continuing operations for the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017 was principally due to the lower sales in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017. The higher gross profit margin from continuing operations for the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017 was principally a result of higher sales in the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017. 
For the reasons set forth above, the Company’s earnings from continuing operations were $1.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017. 
Interest and other income from continuing operations was $357,000 and $697,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, compared to $751,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, for last fiscal year's comparable periods. Interest income decreased 52% and 54%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 primarily as a result of lower average balances of marketable securities held by the Company in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates. During the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, the Company earned interest income principally from its investments, which consisted primarily of short-term instruments and money market funds. 
The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017 primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges, partially offset by lower sales, compared to last year’s comparable period. The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 26-week period ended August 26, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period, primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and higher sales, compared to last year’s comparable period, and a one-time litigation expense of $375,000 in the 26-week period ended August 27, 2017. 
For the reasons set forth above, the Company's net earnings from continuing operations for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 were $1.8 million and $2.6 million, respectively, compared to net earnings of $859,000 and $931,000, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017. 
In the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.09 and $0.13, respectively, including, in both such periods, the tax benefit described above. This compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.04 and $0.05 in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017, respectively. The net impact of the tax benefit described above increased basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.04 in each of the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018. 
The Company believes its financial resources will be sufficient, through the 12 months following the filing of this Form 10-Q Quarterly Report and for the foreseeable future thereafter, to provide for continued investment in working capital and property, plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes. The Company’s financial resources are also available for purchases of the Company's common stock, appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the Company's business. 
The Company's contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as lease agreements, consist only of (i) operating lease commitments and (ii) commitments to purchase raw materials. The Company has no other long-term debt, capital lease obligations, unconditional purchase obligations or other long-term obligations, standby letters of credit, guarantees, standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments or contingent commitments, other than two standby letters of credit in the total amount of $980,000 to secure the Company's obligations under its workers' compensation insurance program. 
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. This guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and expands the related disclosure requirements. The new standard was originally scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. In August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date of this guidance for one year. With the delay, the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and the interim periods within those fiscal years, with an option to adopt the standard on the originally scheduled effective date. The Company has adopted the guidance effective February 26, 2018, the first day of the 2019 fiscal year, and the adoption of this guidance did not impact its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position or disclosures.
