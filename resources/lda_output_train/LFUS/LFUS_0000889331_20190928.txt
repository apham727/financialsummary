For the third quarter of 2019, the Company recognized net sales of $362.0 million compared to $439.2 million in the third quarter of 2018 representing a decrease of $77.2 million, or 17.6%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in the Electronics and Automotive segments and $4.4 million or 1.0% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher volume in the Industrial segment. The Company recognized net income of $35.6 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2019 compared to net income of $53.5 million, or $2.10 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018. The decrease in net income reflects lower operating income in the Electronics segment and foreign exchange losses, partially offset by lower non-segment charges compared to prior year primarily due to the IXYS acquisition.
The Company continues to take actions to improve its cost structure and drive the synergies from the integration of IXYS. The Company expects to realize cost savings from the restructuring activities taken during 2019 including the reorganization of certain manufacturing, selling and administrative functions across all segments and the closure of a European manufacturing facility in the automotive sensors business within the Automotive segment. 
The following table summarizes the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods presented. The third quarter of 2019 includes $5.7 million ($17.9 million year-to-date) of non-segment charges, of which $2.5 million ($11.0 million year-to-date) of restructuring charges are primarily related to employee termination costs and other restructuring charges and $3.2 million ($6.9 million year-to-date) of acquisition-related and integration charges are primarily related to the IXYS acquisition and other contemplated acquisitions.
The third quarter of 2018 includes approximately $10.1 million ($75.6 million year-to-date) of charges related to the IXYS acquisition, which include $36.9 million year-to-date of purchase accounting inventory step-up charges previously recorded during the first and second quarters of 2018, $2.4 million ($16.1 million year-to-date) in acquisition-related and integration costs primarily related to legal, accounting and other expenses, $3.1 million ($8.7 million year-to-date) in backlog amortization costs, $4.6 million ($7.3 million year-to-date) of employee termination costs and other restructuring charges, and $4.5 million year-to-date stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior service periods and $2.1 million year-to-date change in control expense related to IXYS. In addition, there were $0.4 million ($1.6 million year-to-date) of employee termination costs, other restructuring, impairment charges of $1.1 million associated with the exit of the Custom business in the second quarter, and $0.7 million ($1.1 million year-to-date) of acquisition-related expenses for other contemplated acquisitions.
Income before income taxes was $41.4 million, or 11.4% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2019 compared to $68.2 million, or 15.5% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2018. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before taxes was primarily impacted by increased foreign exchange losses of $4.0 million during the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the three months ended September 29, 2018, unrealized investment gains of $2.0 million associated with our equity investments during the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to unrealized losses of $2.6 million during the three months ended September 29, 2018, and increased interest income of $1.0 million during  three months ended September 28, 2019 compared to the three months ended September 29, 2018.

The effective tax rate for the 2019 period is lower than the effective tax rate for the 2018 period primarily due to lower taxes in certain non-US jurisdictions, including the impact of a tax holiday in China which was applicable in the 2019 period but not the 2018 period. The effective tax rate for the 2019 period was lower than the applicable U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to income earned in lower tax jurisdictions.
Net sales decreased $45.5 million, or 10.3%, in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 primarily due to lower volume in electronics products and semiconductor businesses within the Electronics segment, lower volume in automotive sensor and commercial vehicle businesses in the Automotive segment, the exit of the Custom business within Industrial segment during the second quarter of 2018 and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $0.7 million.
Net sales decreased $8.7 million, or 9.7%, in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower volume in semiconductor business within the Electronics segment, lower volume in passenger car products and commercial vehicle businesses within the Automotive segment and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $3.2 million, partially offset by higher volume in electronics products within the Electronics segment and higher volume across all businesses within Industrial segments.
