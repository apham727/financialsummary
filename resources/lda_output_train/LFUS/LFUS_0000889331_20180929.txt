Founded in 1927, Littelfuse is a global manufacturer of leading technologies in circuit protection, power control and sensing.
The Company has products in automotive and commercial vehicles, industrial applications, data and telecommunications, medical devices, consumer electronics and appliances.
The increase in net income reflects operating income increases across the Electronics segment, partially offset by lower operating income in the Automotive segment.
Additionally, the per share results reflect an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 2.1 million resulting from the shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of IXYS.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $252.1 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2018 as compared to $181.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflected higher earnings and favorable working capital management, which more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs and higher cash tax payments.
On July 6, 2018, the Trump administration imposed Section 301 tariffs on certain products (known as List1) that are imported into the United States where the country of origin is China.
The third quarter of 2018 includes $11.2 million ($79.4 million year-to-date) of non-segment charges primarily related to the IXYS acquisition, which includes $36.9 million year-to-date of purchase accounting inventory step-up charges previously recorded during the first and second quarters of 2018, $2.5 million ($16.3 million year-to-date) in acquisition-related and integration costs related to legal, accounting and other expenses $3.1 million ($8.7 million year-to-date) in backlog amortization costs, $4.6 million ($9.4 million year-to-date) of severance and other restructuring charges, $4.5 million year-to-date stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior services periods.
In addition, for the three months ended September 29, 2018, there were charges of $1.0 million ($3.6 million year-to-date) of severance, other restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges, of which $1.1 million of charges associated with the exit of the Custom business in the second quarter.
These charges were primarily attributable to acquisition-related and integration costs related to legal, accounting and other expenses associated with completed or contemplated acquisitions of approximately $4.8 million ($6.6 million year-to-date), including $1.6 million ($1.6 million year-to-date) of purchase accounting inventory charges related to the Company’s 2017 acquisition of U.S. Sensor and $1.5 million ($1.5 million year-to-date) of charges related to restructuring and production transfers in our Asia operations.
Net sales for the first nine months of 2018 increased $399.5 million, or 43.6%, compared to the first nine months of 2017 with increases of $286.2 million and $6.5 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, respectively and $20.0 million of favorable changes in foreign exchange rates.
Gross profit was $498.2 million, or 37.9% of net sales, in the first nine months of 2018, compared to $379.9 million, or 41.4% of net sales in the first nine months of 2017.
The increase in gross profit reflects the IXYS acquisition and volume growth and expense leverage across all segments.
Total operating expenses were $103.4 million, or 23.5% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $75.0 million, or 23.6% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2017.

Total operating expenses as a percent of net sales increased from 23.1% for the first nine months of 2017 to 24.7% for the first nine months of 2018 primarily due to the higher amortization expense and acquisition-related and integration charges noted above.
Operating income was $76.2 million, an increase of $17.6 million, or 30.1%, for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $58.6 million for the third quarter of 2017.
Operating margins decreased from 18.4% in the third quarter of 2017 to 17.4% in the third quarter of 2018 driven by higher amortization expense, restructuring and integration charges.

In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above income before income taxes was favorably impacted by increases in foreign exchange gains of $4.9 million and increases in other income of $1.4 million primarily due to unrealized investment gains in our equity investments partially offset by higher interest expense of $7.1 million mainly resulting from increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition.
The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2018 was higher than the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2017 primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform and the acquisition of IXYS.
The Industrial segment net sales increased $8.7 million, or 10.9% in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 due to higher volumes primarily in the power fuse and relay operations.
Management expects that the Company’s (i) current level of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, (ii) current and forecasted cash flows from operations, (iii) availability under existing funding arrangements, and (iv) access to capital in the capital markets will provide sufficient funds to support the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, investments, and debt obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.
