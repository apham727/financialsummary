On July 6, 2018, the Trump administration imposed Section 301 tariffs on certain products (known as List1) that are imported into the United States where the country of origin is China.

These tariffs primarily impact the Electronics segment and to a lesser extent our Automotive segment. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on our future results of operations.

The remaining increase in net sales was driven by higher volume primarily in the Electronics businesses and higher volume in the Industrial segment.
Operating income was $76.2 million, an increase of $17.6 million, or 30.1%, for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $58.6 million for the third quarter of 2017. The increase in operating income is due to the acquisition of IXYS and higher volume due to the strong demand across various end markets and geographies within our Electronics segment that was partially offset by lower operating income in the Automotive segment. Operating margins decreased from 18.4% in the third quarter of 2017 to 17.4% in the third quarter of 2018 driven by higher amortization expense, restructuring and integration charges. 
Operating income for the first nine months of 2018 was $173.4 million compared to $167.7 million for the first nine months of 2017. The increase in operating income is primarily due to the acquisition of IXYS and higher volume in the electronics and industrial businesses partially offset by $36.9 million of purchase accounting inventory charges, higher acquisition and integration charges and amortization expense. Operating margins decreased from 18.3% to 13.2% in 2018 driven by the purchase accounting inventory charges, higher amortization expense and acquisition and integration charges that negatively impacted margins by 2.8%, 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively.

In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above income before income taxes was favorably impacted by increases in foreign exchange gains of $4.9 million and increases in other income of $1.4 million primarily due to unrealized investment gains in our equity investments partially offset by higher interest expense of $7.1 million mainly resulting from increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition.
European net sales increased $115.4 million, or 63.2%, in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 . The increase in net sales was primarily due to incremental net sales related to the IXYS acquisition of $86.7 million with strong growth especially in the passive and sensor businesses in the Electronics segment and continued growth in commercial vehicle, automotive sensor businesses as well as favorable foreign currency effects of $14.4 million partially offset by lower volumes in the passenger car business.

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, "Leases" (Topic 842). This ASU requires lessees to recognize, on the balance sheet, assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases of greater than twelve months. The accounting by lessors will remain largely unchanged. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Adoption will require a modified retrospective transition. The Company will adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019. The Company has made progress on assessing the Company’s portfolio of leases and compiling a central repository of all active leases. We are in the process of assessing the design of the future lease process and drafting a policy to address the new standard requirements. Key lease data elements are being evaluated including developing a methodology for determining the incremental borrowing rate across all countries where we have operations. While the Company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact the new lease accounting standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company expects to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for its operating leases in the Consolidated Balance Sheet upon adoption.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14 "Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, which amends ASC 715-20, Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General. The amended guidance modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other post-retirement plans by removing and adding certain disclosures for these plans. The eliminated disclosures include (a) the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI") expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit costs over the next fiscal year, and (b) the effects of a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates on the net periodic benefit costs and the benefit obligation for post-retirement health care benefits. Additional disclosures include descriptions of significant gains and losses affecting the benefit obligation for the period. The adoption of this guidance will modify our disclosures but will not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
