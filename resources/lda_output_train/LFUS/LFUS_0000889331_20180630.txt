Founded in 1927, Littelfuse is a global leader in circuit protection products with advancing platforms in power control and sensor technologies, serving customers in the electronics, automotive, and industrial markets.
Net sales for Electronics increased $130.0 million, or 76.7%, primarily due to the acquisition of IXYS and strong growth across all the business units and favorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $8.0 million.
Net sales in the Industrial segment increased $5.1 million or 18.7% due to volume growth across all the segment’s business units.
The Company recognized net income of $42.3 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $48.6 million, or $2.11 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017.
Additionally, the per share results reflect an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 2.1 million resulting from the shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of IXYS.
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflected higher earnings and favorable working capital management that more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs and higher cash taxes.
The exit of the Radio Pulse business resulted in restructuring charges of $2.1 million, of which $1.4 million was for severance charges and $0.7 million of other restructuring charges.
The charges related to the IXYS acquisition total $24.4 million ($63.2 million year-to-date) and include $19.0 million ($36.9 million year-to-date) of purchase accounting inventory charges, $2.3 million ($14.1 million year-to-date) in acquisition-related and integration costs primarily related to legal, accounting and other expenses associated with the acquisition of IXYS, $3.1 million ($5.6 million year-to-date) in backlog amortization costs, stock compensation expense recognized immediately upon close for converted IXYS options related to prior services periods of $4.5 million year-to-date and other charges of $2.1 million year-to-date.

Net sales for the first six months of 2018 increased $278.2 million, or 46.5%, compared to the first six months of 2017 with increases of $186.5 million and $6.5 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions, respectively.

The increase in gross profit reflects the IXYS acquisition and volume growth across all segments and expense leverage across all segments.
Total operating expenses were $109.4 million, or 23.8% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $72.3 million, or 23.1% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2017.

Increases in operating income across the Electronics segment were more than offset by purchase accounting inventory charges of $19.0 million, higher amortization charges of $7.2 million and higher restructuring and impairment charges of $4.3 million along with the costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the IXYS acquisition as described above.
Operating income for the first six months of 2018 was $97.2 million, or 11.1% of net sales, compared to $109.1 million, or 18.2% of net sales, for the first six months of 2017.
The decrease in operating income is primarily due to the purchase accounting inventory charges of $36.9 million along with the costs associated with the acquisition and integration of IXYS as described above.
Income before income taxes was $52.3 million, or 11.4% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $57.4 million, or 18.3% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2017.
In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before income taxes was impacted by increased unfavorable foreign exchange losses of $3.8 million primarily due to fluctuations in the Euro and Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and increased interest expense of $2.5 million associated with the increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition.
Income before income taxes for the first six months of 2018 was $97.0 million, or 11.1% of net sales compared to $104.8 million, or 17.5% of net sales, for the first six months of 2017.

The Electronics segment net sales increased $240.6 million, or 74.5%, in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 due to incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions of $186.5 million and $6.5 million, respectively, higher volume across all businesses driven by the continued strong electronics cycle and favorable foreign exchange impacts of $8.5 million.
The Automotive segment net sales increased $29.0 million, or 12.9%, in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 due to increased volume across all businesses with the commercial vehicle and sensor businesses having the most growth as well as favorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $11.9 million.
