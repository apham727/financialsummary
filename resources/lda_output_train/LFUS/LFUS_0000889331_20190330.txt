For the first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized net sales of $405.5 million compared to $417.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 representing a decrease of $12.3 million, or 2.9%. The decrease was primarily driven by $9.9 million or 2.4% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and decreased volume in the passenger car and automotive sensors businesses within the Automotive segment, partially offset by higher volumes in the semiconductor business in the Electronics segment as result of the IXYS acquisition completed on January 17, 2018. The Company recognized net income of $37.0 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to net income of $36.0 million, or $1.45 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in net income reflects lower non-segment charges compared to prior year primarily due to the IXYS acquisition, partially offset by lower operating income across all segments and foreign exchange losses. 
The Company continues to take actions to improve its cost structure and drive the synergies from the integration of IXYS. The Company expects to realize cost savings from the restructuring activities taken during the first quarter of 2019 including the reorganization of certain manufacturing, selling and administrative functions within the Electronics and Automotive segments. In April 2019, we announced the closure of a European manufacturing facility in the automotive sensor business within the Automotive segment. The Company estimates the restructuring costs associated with this plant closure to be approximately $5.0 million to $7.0 million.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $30.9 million for the three months ended March 30, 2019 as compared to $69.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
