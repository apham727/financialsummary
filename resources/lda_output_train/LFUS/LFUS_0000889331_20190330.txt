For the first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized net sales of $405.5 million compared to $417.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 representing a decrease of $12.3 million, or 2.9%.
The decrease was primarily driven by $9.9 million or 2.4% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and decreased volume in the passenger car and automotive sensors businesses within the Automotive segment, partially offset by higher volumes in the semiconductor business in the Electronics segment as result of the IXYS acquisition completed on January 17, 2018.
In April 2019, we announced the closure of a European manufacturing facility in the automotive sensor business within the Automotive segment.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $30.9 million for the three months ended March 30, 2019 as compared to $69.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Net sales decreased $12.3 million or 2.9% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to $9.9 million or 2.4% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, lower volume in the automotive sensors and passenger car businesses within the Automotive segment, partially offset by higher sales in the semiconductor business driven by the IXYS acquisition.
Gross profit was $155.2 million, or 38.3% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $149.6 million, or 35.8% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018.

Income before income taxes was $46.4 million, or 11.5% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $44.6 million, or 10.7% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018.
Income tax expense was $9.5 million, or an effective tax rate of 20.3%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $8.6 million, or an effective tax rate of 19.3%, for the first quarter of 2018.
Net sales increased $1.0 million, or 0.4%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to $10.2 million increase in the semiconductor business due to the IXYS acquisition completed on January 17, 2018, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impact of $5.3 million and lower electronics products volume.
Net sales decreased slightly by $0.6 million, or 2.4%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to the exit of the Custom business during the second quarter of 2018 and unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $0.2 million, partially offset by higher volume across the power fuse and relay businesses.
