In 1989, we were formed and incorporated in California. We maintain a majority-owned subsidiary in Mexico (since 1998) and two divisions in each of Taiwan (since 1998) and China (since 2005). Our Mexico location closed all operations in May 2013 (final closure is pending sale of our local 15,000 sq. ft. office and warehouse facility) and our Taiwan and China locations are for supporting overseas customers, inventory sourcing, purchases and coordinating the manufacture of our products. Our China location also serves as the engineering designs support center responsible for arranging pre-production scheduling and mass production runs with joint venture partners for our projects, making component datasheets and test specifications, preparing samples, monitoring quality of shipments and performing failure analysis reports. 
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all wholly owned divisions, including its 60% majority-owned subsidiary, Taitron Components Mexico, S.A. de C.V. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new accounting standard on leasing. The new standard will require companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also proposes a dual model for recognizing expense. This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 with early adoption permitted. We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and we are preparing for the changes to be made to our consolidated financial statements. We expect the adoption of these accounting changes will not impact our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets. 
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. This guidance will be effective for the year ending December 31, 2019 and interim reporting periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted. We expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
On January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09) applying the modified retrospective method. The primary impact of adoption relates to additional disclosures and presentation of revenue by primary geographical market, major product line and the timing of revenue recognition. 
Our $50,000 investment in joint venture as of June 30, 2018, relates to our 49% ownership of Grand Shine Management Limited (Dong Guan, China), an electronic device contract manufacturer, and joint venture with its 51% owner, Teamforce Company Limited. Our investment is accounted for under the equity method basis of accounting. As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we have recorded our 49% share of cumulative unrealized losses from the inception of our investment in Grand Shine Management of $1,126,000 and $991,000, respectively. 
On April 21, 2008 we entered into a $3,000,000 credit facility, collateralized by real property, from K.S. Best International Co. Ltd., a company controlled by the brother of our Chief Executive Officer. Credit is available in $500,000 advances, each advance is payable in monthly interest only installments, at the rate of Prime + 0.25% per annum. As of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the aggregate outstanding balance on this credit facility was $0 and $500,000, respectively. 
We made payments to K.S. Best International Co. Ltd., a company controlled by the brother of our Chief Executive Officer of approximately $6,000 for both of the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. These payments were for professional fees related to the operational management of our Taiwan office. In addition, we also made interest expense payments on our credit facility of approximately $3,000 and $11,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively and $9,000 and $21,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 4.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.  
References to “Taitron,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Taitron Components Incorporated and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise specifically defines. 
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our June 30, 2018, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 49% of current assets and 34% of total assets. However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash. We cannot assure you that demand in the discrete semiconductor market will increase and that market conditions will improve. Therefore, it is possible that further declines in our carrying values of inventory may result. 
Net sales in the second quarter of 2018 totaled $2,150,000 versus $1,773,000 in the comparable period for 2017, an increase of $377,000 or 21.3% over the same period last year. The increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales volume. 
Other income, net of other expense, in the second quarter of 2018 was $29,000 versus $31,000 in the comparable period for 2017. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 
Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $1,633,000 versus $1,630,000 in the comparable period for 2017, and gross margin percentage of net sales was approximately 42.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 41.4% for 2017, respectively. 
Other income, net of other losses, in the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $77,000 versus $60,000 in the comparable period for 2017. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $785,000 as opposed to $70,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of $715,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from inventory, accounts payables and accounts receivables compared to the prior period. 
Inventory is included in current assets; however, it will take over one year for the inventory to turn. Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash. 
We believe that funds generated from, or used in operations, in addition to existing cash balances are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of short-term commercial loans, asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities.
