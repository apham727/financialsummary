In 1989, we were formed and incorporated in California. We maintain a majority-owned subsidiary in Mexico (since 1998) and two divisions in each of Taiwan (since 1997) and China (since 2005). Our Mexico location closed all operations in May 2013 (final closure is pending sale of our local 15,000 sq. ft. office and warehouse facility) and our Taiwan and China locations are for supporting overseas customers, inventory sourcing, purchases and coordinating the manufacture of our products. Our China location also serves as the engineering design support center responsible for arranging pre-production scheduling and mass production runs with joint venture partners for our projects, making component datasheets and test specifications, preparing samples, monitoring quality of shipments and performing failure analysis reports. 
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all wholly owned divisions, including its 60% majority-owned subsidiary, Taitron Components Mexico, S.A. de C.V. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard on leasing. The new standard will require companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also proposes a dual model for recognizing expense. This guidance was effective in our first quarter of 2019. We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and the adoption of these accounting changes have not impacted our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets. 
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. This guidance was effective in our first quarter of 2019. The adoption of this guidance has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to receive. 
In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by primary geographical market, major product line, and timing of revenue recognition. 
$193,000 relates to 1,322,552 common shares of ZT and represents approximately 9% of their total outstanding shares although we do not have significant influence or control.    
We made payments to K.S. Best International Co. Ltd., a company controlled by the brother of our Chief Executive Officer of approximately $0 and $6,000 for three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively and $0 and $12,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. These payments were for professional fees related to the operational management of our Taiwan office. In addition, we also made interest expense payments on our credit facility of approximately $0 and $3,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively and $0 and $9,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.  
References to “Taitron,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Taitron Components Incorporated and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise specifically defines. 
Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer. Reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns. Sales returns for both the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $1,000 and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $4,000 and $3,000, respectively. The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 aggregated $40,000 and $38,000, respectively. 
Net sales in the second quarter of 2019 totaled $1,772,000 versus $2,150,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $378,000 or 17.6% over the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of ODM project sales volume. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2019 totaled $616,000 versus $550,000 in the comparable period for 2018. The $66,000 increase was primarily driven by an increase in salaries for severance pay incurred during the second quarter of 2019. 
Other income, net of other expense, in the second quarter of 2019 was $31,000 versus $29,000 in the comparable period for 2018. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 
Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $1,518,000 versus $1,633,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was approximately 48.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 42.9% for 2018, respectively. The approximately 5% gross profit increase was driven by shipments of new higher gross margin ODM projects. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2019 totaled $1,146,000 versus $1,110,000 in the comparable period for 2018, an increase of $36,000 or 3.2% over the same period last year. The $36,000 increase was primarily driven by an increase of $66,000 in salaries primarily for severance pay incurred during the second quarter of 2019, offset by a decrease of $23,000 in professional fees paid for engineering design services. 
Other income, net of other expenses, in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $56,000 versus $77,000 in the comparable period for 2018. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 
We believe that funds generated from operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, related party short-term loans, are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities. Otherwise, we may need to liquidate assets to generate the necessary working capital. 
Inventory is included and classified as a current asset. As of June 30, 2019, inventory represented approximately 45% of current assets and 32% of total assets. However, it is likely to take over one year for the inventory to turn and therefore is likely not saleable within a one-year time frame. Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash.
