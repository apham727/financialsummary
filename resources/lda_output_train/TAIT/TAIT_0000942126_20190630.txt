We maintain a majority-owned subsidiary in Mexico (since 1998) and two divisions in each of Taiwan (since 1997) and China (since 2005).
Our China location also serves as the engineering design support center responsible for arranging pre-production scheduling and mass production runs with joint venture partners for our projects, making component datasheets and test specifications, preparing samples, monitoring quality of shipments and performing failure analysis reports.
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all wholly owned divisions, including its 60% majority-owned subsidiary, Taitron Components Mexico, S.A. de C.V. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The new standard will require companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also proposes a dual model for recognizing expense.
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to receive.
Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of products sold.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 1 of Part 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
References to “Taitron,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Taitron Components Incorporated and its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise specifically defines.
These estimates have a significant impact on our valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns, doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and deferred income taxes.
Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer.
Inventory – Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) or net realizable value.
We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,356,000 and $4,597,000 at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,274,000 and $7,189,000, respectively.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our June 30, 2019, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 45% of current assets and 32% of total assets.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
Net sales in the second quarter of 2019 totaled $1,772,000 versus $2,150,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $378,000 or 17.6% over the same period last year.
Gross profit for the second quarter of 2019 was $835,000 versus $979,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 47.1% in the second quarter of 2019 versus 45.5% in the comparable period for 2018.
Net income was $256,000 for the second quarter of 2019 versus $399,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $143,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above.
Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $1,518,000 versus $1,633,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was approximately 48.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 42.9% for 2018, respectively.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2019 totaled $1,146,000 versus $1,110,000 in the comparable period for 2018, an increase of $36,000 or 3.2% over the same period last year.
The $36,000 increase was primarily driven by an increase of $66,000 in salaries primarily for severance pay incurred during the second quarter of 2019, offset by a decrease of $23,000 in professional fees paid for engineering design services.
