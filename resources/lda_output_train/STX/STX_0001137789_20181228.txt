Seagate Technology plc (the Company) is a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions. Its principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, the Company produces a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSDs) and storage subsystems.  
Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, and most SSDs use NAND flash memory.  
The Companys HDD products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems; edge compute applications, where its products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing; and edge non-compute applications, where its products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as portable external storage systems, surveillance systems, digital video recorders (DVRs), network-attached storage (NAS), and gaming consoles. The Companys SSD products mainly include serial attached SCSI (SAS) and Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) SSDs.  
The results of operations for the three and six months ended December 28, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for any subsequent interim period or for the Companys fiscal year ending June 28, 2019. The Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal year of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to June 30. Both the three and six months ended December 28, 2018 and the three and six months ended December 29, 2017 consisted of 13 weeks and 26 weeks, respectively. Fiscal year 2019, which ends on June 28, 2019, and fiscal year 2018, which ended on June 29, 2018, are both comprised of 52 weeks. The fiscal quarters ended December 28, 2018, September 28, 2018, and December 29, 2017, are also referred to herein as the December 2018 quarter, the September 2018 quarter and the December 2017 quarter, respectively.  
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 (ASC Subtopic 350-40), Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software - Customers Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract. This ASU aligns the accounting for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the accounting for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 (ASC Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and FASB also issued certain interpretive clarifications on this new guidance which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes the revenue recognition guidance under ASC 605. It also requires entities to disclose both quantitative and qualitative information that enable financial statements users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This ASU became effective and was adopted by the Company in the September 2018 quarter retrospectively with a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit at the date of adoption (modified retrospective transition approach). The Company has completed the adoption and implemented policies, processes and controls to support the new standards measurement and disclosure requirements.  
$800 million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.75% Senior Notes due November 2018 (the 2018 Notes). The interest on the 2018 Notes was payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The issuer under the 2018 Notes was Seagate HDD Cayman, and the obligations under the 2018 Notes were fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by the Company. During the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, the Company repurchased $128 million and $150 million aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes, respectively, for cash at a premium to their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a loss of approximately $2 million on repurchases during the three and six months ended December 29, 2017 which is included in Other, net on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. On November 15, 2018, the 2018 Notes matured and the Company repaid the entire outstanding principal amount of $499 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  
$750 million Aggregate Principal Amount of 4.25% Senior Notes due March 2022 (the 2022 Notes). The interest on the 2022 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The issuer under the 2022 Notes is Seagate HDD Cayman, and the obligations under the 2022 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by the Company.

The Company recorded income tax provisions of $14 million and $32 million in the three and six months ended December 28, 2018, respectively. The income tax provision for the three and six months ended December 28, 2018 included approximately $5 million and $4 million of net discrete tax benefits, respectively, primarily associated with the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.  
During the six months ended December 28, 2018, the Companys unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties decreased by approximately $20 million to $40 million. The unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate were $40 million at December 28, 2018, subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals. During the twelve months beginning December 29, 2018, the Company expects that its unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by approximately $7 million, primarily as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.  
Other intangible assets consist primarily of existing technology, customer relationships and trade names acquired in business combinations. Intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over the respective estimated useful lives of the assets. Amortization is charged to Operating expenses in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Our SSD products mainly include serial attached SCSI (SAS) and Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) SSDs.  
Our enterprise data solutions (formerly referred to as the cloud systems and solutions) portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturer (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers.  
Revenue for the six months ended December 28, 2018 increased by $160 million from the six months ended December 29, 2017 as a result of an increase in exabytes shipped due to higher demand for our high capacity HDD product portfolio, partially offset by price erosion.  
Compared to the six months ended December 29, 2017, gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the six months ended December 28, 2018 increased primarily driven by favorable product mix and improved factory utilization as a result of increased revenue from our high capacity HDD product portfolio, partially offset by a decline in prices for NAND flash memory and general price erosion.

Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investment portfolio including investment in debt security in Toshiba Memory Corporation (TMC, formerly known as K.K. Pangea). As of December 28, 2018, we had no other-than-temporary impairment for our investment in debt security and we had no available-for-sale debt securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months. We determined no available-for-sale debt securities were other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 28, 2018.  
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. From time to time, we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures. Our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. At this time, we have not identified any material exposure associated with the potential changes related to the British vote to exit the European Union.
