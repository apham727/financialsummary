Seagate Technology plc (the Company) is a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions. Its principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, the Company produces a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSDs) and storage subsystems.  
Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, and most SSDs use NAND flash memory.  
The Companys HDD products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems; edge compute applications, where its products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing; and edge non-compute applications, where its products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as portable external storage systems, surveillance systems, digital video recorders (DVRs), network-attached storage (NAS), and gaming consoles. The Companys SSD products mainly include serial attached SCSI (SAS) and Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) SSDs.  
The results of operations for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for any subsequent interim period or for the Companys fiscal year ending June 28, 2019. The Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal year of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to June 30. Both the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018 consisted of 13 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively. Fiscal year 2019, which ends on June 28, 2019, and fiscal year 2018, which ended on June 29, 2018, are both comprised of 52 weeks. The fiscal quarters ended March 29, 2019, December 28, 2018, September 28, 2018, and March 30, 2018, are also referred to herein as the March 2019 quarter, the December 2018 quarter, the September 2018 quarter and the March 2018 quarter, respectively.  
Revenue from sales of products is generally recognized upon transfer of control to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products, net of sales taxes. This typically occurs upon shipment from the Company. When applicable, the Company includes shipping charges billed to customers in Revenue and includes the related shipping costs in Cost of revenue on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15 (ASC Subtopic 350-40), Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software - Customers Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract. This ASU aligns the accounting for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the accounting for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 (ASC Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and FASB also issued certain interpretive clarifications on this new guidance which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes the revenue recognition guidance under ASC 605. It also requires entities to disclose both quantitative and qualitative information that enable financial statements users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This ASU became effective and was adopted by the Company in the September 2018 quarter retrospectively with a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit at the date of adoption (modified retrospective transition approach). The Company has completed the adoption and implemented policies, processes and controls to support the new standards measurement and disclosure requirements.  
As of March 29, 2019 and June 29, 2018, the Company had approximately $1.3 billion investment in non-convertible preferred stock of Toshiba Memory Corporation (TMC, formerly known as K.K. Pangea). The Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity. As such, the investment, with a contractual maturity of six years starting from May 31, 2018, is accounted for as a held-to-maturity debt security, carried at cost and adjusted for amortization of transaction costs into interest income. Additionally, the debt security has a contractual payment-in-kind (PIK) income which will be paid in cash upon redemption of the investment. PIK income computed at the contractual rate is accrued into Interest income in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and added to the carrying value of the Investment in debt security on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, the PIK income earned was $16 million and $47 million, respectively. There was no other-than-temporary impairment identified for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019. Please refer to Note 8 - Fair Value for more details.  
On February 20, 2019, the Company terminated its senior unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire on January 15, 2020, under which the Company was able to draw up to $700 million. Upon termination, the Company and its subsidiary Seagate HDD Cayman entered into a new credit agreement (the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility) which provides the Company with a $1.3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The term of the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility is through February 20, 2024. The loans made under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a variable margin that will be determined based on the corporate credit rating of the Company. The Company and certain other material subsidiaries of the Company fully and unconditionally guarantee the revolving credit facility. The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility also allows the Company to increase the facility by up to an aggregate of $300 million, provided that (i) there has been, and will be after giving effect to such increase, no default, (ii) the increase is at least $25 million, and (iii) the existing commitments under the facility receive 0.50% most favored nation protection. An aggregate amount of up to $75 million of the facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit, and an aggregate amount of up to $50 million of the facility is also available for swing line loans.  
$500 million Aggregate Principal Amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due March 2024 (the 2024 Notes). The interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year. The issuer under the 2024 Notes is Seagate HDD Cayman, and the obligations under the 2024 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by the Company.  
$1 billion Aggregate Principal Amount of 4.75% Senior Notes due January 2025 (the 2025 Notes). The interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually on January 1 and July 1 of each year. The issuer under the 2025 Notes is Seagate HDD Cayman, and the obligations under the 2025 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by the Company.  
$700 million Aggregate Principal Amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due June 2027 (the 2027 Notes). The interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The issuer under the 2027 Notes is Seagate HDD Cayman, and the obligations under the 2027 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by the Company.  
$500 million Aggregate Principal Amount of 5.75% Senior Notes due December 2034 (the 2034 Notes). The interest on the 2034 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The issuer under the 2034 Notes is Seagate HDD Cayman, and the obligations under the 2034 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by the Company.  
The Company recorded income tax provisions of $20 million and $52 million in the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019, respectively. The income tax provision for the three and nine months ended March 29, 2019 included approximately $9 million and $5 million of net discrete tax expense, respectively, primarily associated with a deferred withholding tax liability resulting from a change in indefinite reinvestment assertion for a foreign subsidiary. This was partially offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation.

Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, and most SSDs use NAND flash memory.  
Our HDD products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems; edge compute applications, where our products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing; and edge non-compute applications, where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as portable external storage systems, surveillance systems, digital video recorders (DVRs), network-attached storage (NAS) and gaming consoles. Our SSD products mainly include serial attached SCSI (SAS) and Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) SSDs.  
During the March 2019 quarter, we shipped 77 exabytes of HDD storage capacity. We generated revenue of approximately $2.3 billion, gross margin of 26% and our operating cash flow was $438 million. We repurchased approximately 7 million of our ordinary shares for $327 million and paid $178 million in dividends. We entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility) and borrowed $200 million from the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.  
We maintain various sales incentive programs such as channel rebates and price masking. Sales incentive programs were approximately 13%, 13% and 12% of gross drive revenue for the March 2019, December 2018 and March 2018 quarters, respectively. Adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales incentive programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods were less than 1% of quarterly gross revenue in all periods presented.  
In the March 2019 quarter, total warranty cost was 0.6% of revenue and included a favorable change in estimates of prior warranty accruals of 0.5% of revenue due to improvements in return rates on newer generation products. Warranty cost related to new shipments was 1.1%, 1.1% and 1.3% of revenue for the March 2019, December 2018 and March 2018 quarters, respectively.  
Product development expense. Product development expense for the March 2019 quarter decreased by $8 million compared to the December 2018 quarter due to a $7 million decrease in other general expenses mainly as a result of timing of materials purchases, a $4 million decrease in variable compensation expense, offset by a $2 million increase in share-based compensation expense.  
Compared to the corresponding nine months ended March 30, 2018, Product development expense for the nine months ended March 29, 2019 decreased by $17 million primarily due to an $18 million decrease in variable compensation expense and a $5 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits primarily due to the voluntary early exit program and restructuring of our workforce in prior periods, partially offset by a $9 million increase in share-based compensation expense.

Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investment portfolio including investment in debt security in Toshiba Memory Corporation (TMC, formerly known as K.K. Pangea). As of March 29, 2019, we had no other-than-temporary impairment for our investment in debt security and we had no available-for-sale debt securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than 12 months. We determined no available-for-sale debt securities were other-than-temporarily impaired as of March 29, 2019.  
We have fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations. We enter into debt obligations for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs. Our 2019 revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus a variable margin.
