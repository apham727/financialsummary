Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance.
We refer to our term software licenses, security software licenses, SaaS, and associated service arrangements as subscription offers.In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we had strong performance across the business and delivered strong revenue growth, margins and operating cash flow.
Our product revenue reflected growth in Infrastructure Platforms, Applications and Security, and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions.
Notwithstanding the third quarter fiscal 2019 results, we continue to operate in a challenging and highly competitive environment.
While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term.
In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas increased $534 million, driven in large part by product revenue growth in the United States.Instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the pending United Kingdom “Brexit” withdrawal from the European Union, the current economic challenges in China, including global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties, and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions.
Our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment.
In addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government could affect customers’ perception of the products of IT companies which design and manufacture products in the United States.
Impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the United States and could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
