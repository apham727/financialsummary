 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842). The FASB issued this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the new standard. 
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”. This update provides guidance on how to record eight specific cash flow issues. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and a retrospective transition method to each period should be presented. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this update on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)”, requiring that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective approach which requires application of the guidance for all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard and does not expect the adoption will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
 Approximately 31% and 55% of net benchtop laboratory equipment sales (48% and 30% of total revenues) for the three month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories. 
 Approximately 36% and 52% of net benchtop laboratory equipment sales (46% and 36% of total revenues) for the six month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories. 
 Approximately 16% and 23% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (21% and 16% of total revenues) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, two customers accounted in the aggregate for approximately 11% and 16% of net sales of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (15% and 11% of the Company’s total revenues). 
 In valuing assets and liabilities, the Company is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company calculated the fair value of its Level 1 and 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments where available or based on other observable instruments. These calculations take into consideration the credit risk of both the Company and its counterparties. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. 
 The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria. The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the following tables. 
 Total amortization expense was $61,100 and $76,200 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively and $122,200 and $154,100 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets is $124,700 for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, $185,800 for fiscal 2019, $65,400 for fiscal 2020, $48,000 for fiscal 2021, $27,000 for fiscal 2022, and $7,400 thereafter.

The Company reflected a loss before income tax benefit of $290,100 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4,700 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 mainly due to decreased catalyst research instrument sales and product development costs as previously discussed. The results reflected total non-cash amounts for depreciation and amortization of $77,000 and $154,100 for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2017 compared to $93,800 and $189,500 for the corresponding three and six month periods in 2016.

 Total other income decreased by $2,200 (26.5%) from $8,300 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 to $6,100 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 due to lower interest on its investment securities.

The benchtop laboratory equipment sales reflected $664,200 of Torbal brand product sales for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $685,500 in the six months ended December 31, 2016. 
 The overall gross profit percentage for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was 38.4% compared to 34.5% for the six months ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations (which is sold at higher margins) consisting of a higher percentage of total sales for the year.

  The Company has a Demand Line of Credit through June 2018 with First National Bank of Pennsylvania which provides for borrowings of up to $300,000 for regular working capital needs, bearing interest at prime, currently 4.5%. Advances on the line, are secured by a pledge of the Company’s assets including inventory, accounts, chattel paper, equipment and general intangibles of the Company. As of December 31, 2017 $40,000 which was borrowed by our subsidiary, Altamira Instruments, was outstanding under such line. In addition, the Company utilized $245,400 of its borrowing availability under the line as collateral for a warranty standby letter of credit required during a two year warranty period as a condition of sale for a large order of catalyst research instruments shipped in a prior fiscal year and installed in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, leaving an available borrowing balance of $14,600 under the line of credit.
