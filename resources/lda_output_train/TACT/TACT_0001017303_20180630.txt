We have reviewed those policies and determined that they remain our critical accounting policies for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 was driven by the initial shipments of the AccuDate XL to two existing customers in support of large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal.
Shipments of AccuDate XL terminals exceeded sales of AccuDate 9700 terminals for the first time in the second quarter of 2018.
We expect sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to continue to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 as we benefit from the strategic selling and marketing investments implemented during 2017.
