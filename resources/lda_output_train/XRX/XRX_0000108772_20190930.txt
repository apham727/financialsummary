On March 6, 2019, the Xerox Board of Directors approved a reorganization (the “Reorganization”) of the Company's corporate structure into a holding company structure.
On July 31, 2019, Xerox completed the Reorganization, pursuant to which Xerox became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox Holdings.
The business operations, directors and executive officers of the Company did not change as a result of the Reorganization.
Each share of Xerox Holdings Series A Preferred Stock has the same designations, rights, powers and preferences, and the same qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the shares of Xerox Series B Preferred Stock, with the addition of certain voting rights.
Subsequent to the Reorganization, Xerox Holdings contributed the Xerox Series B Preferred Stock it held to Xerox in exchange for additional capital and Xerox subsequently extinguished the Series B Preferred Stock.
In March 2019, as part of Project Own It, we entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we are outsourcing certain global administrative and support functions, including, among others, selected information technology and finance functions (excluding accounting).
HCL is expected to make certain up-front and ongoing investments in software, tools and other technology to consolidate, optimize and automate the transferred functions with the goal of providing improved service levels and significant cost savings.
The shared services arrangement with HCL includes a total aggregate spending commitment by us of approximately $1.3 billion over the next 7 years.

We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency.
Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $68 million including capital expenditures of $48 million and acquisitions of $42 million partially offset by proceeds from the sale of non-core assets.
This impact gradually mitigated during the latter part of the second quarter and was much less of an impact in the third quarter.
We expect total revenues to decline approximately 7.9% in 2019, including an approximate 1.5-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency.
Additionally, we continue to expect share repurchases of at least $600 million and dividend payments to shareholders of $250 million in 2019 and we increased our expectations for full year 2019 cash flows from operations to be between $1,175 million and $1,275 million, up from between $1,150 million to $1,250 million, and decreased our expectations for capital expenditures to $75 million, down from $150 million.
