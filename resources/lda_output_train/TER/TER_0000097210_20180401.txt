The consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of Teradyne and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Teradyne adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.
Teradyne determines performance obligations by assessing whether the products or services are distinct from the other elements of the contract.
Transaction price is allocated to each individual performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of that performance obligation.
In order to determine the appropriate timing for revenue recognition, Teradyne first determines if the transaction meets any of three criteria for over time recognition.
Teradyne uses input variables such as hours or months utilized or costs incurred to determine the amount of revenue to recognize in a given period.
For transactions which do not meet the criteria for over time recognition, Teradyne will recognize revenue at a point in time based on an assessment of the five criteria for transfer of control.
Typically acceptance of Teradynes products and services is a formality as Teradyne delivers similar systems, instruments and robots to standard specifications.
The following table provides information about disaggregated revenue by primary geographical market, major product line and timing of revenue recognition.
Customers have the option to purchase an extended warranty, which extends the warranty period for systems and robots beyond the one year standard warranty.
The relative standalone selling price of the extended warranty is recognized ratably over the course of the extended warranty based on months completed.
Teradyne sells training and applications support to customers either in standalone transactions or included with system purchases.
Training and applications support included in system orders are valued based on their standalone selling price and all training and applications support is recognized over time as the customer receives and consumes the benefit associated with each.
Teradyne has estimated the standalone selling price for these services based on adjusted market assessments.
Teradyne does not have material remaining performance obligations from contracts with an original expected duration of greater than one year.
Teradyne has adopted the practical expedients available within ASC 340 Other Assets and Deferred Costs for contract assets, specifically in relation to incremental costs of obtaining a contract.
Teradyne has adopted the practical expedient which states an entity need not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the entity expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.
Differences are the result of timing differences between the recognition of revenue under ASC 606 and ASC 605 primarily with respect to software transactions deferred due to lack of vendor specific objective evidence of price under ASC 605 and Teradynes assessment of acceptance under ASC 606.
 Cost. Teradyne retrospectively adopted the new accounting guidance on presentation of net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs in the first quarter of 2018.
