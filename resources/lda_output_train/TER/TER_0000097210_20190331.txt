The accompanying financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Teradynes Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 1, 2019, for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Under this method of adoption, the comparative information in the consolidated financial statements has not been revised and continues to be reported under the previously applicable lease accounting guidance (ASC 840).
Teradyne also utilized the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance which included the carry-forward of historical lease classification.
Adoption of ASC 842 resulted in recording ROU assets and lease liabilities of approximately $50.1 million and $54.3 million, respectively.
The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on beginning retained earnings, the consolidated statement of operations, cash flows, or earnings per share.
Teradyne determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations.
Teradyne determines if the lease is operating or finance at the lease commencement date based upon the terms of the lease and the nature of the asset.
The lease term used to calculate the lease liability includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.
As Teradyne is typically unable to determine the implicit rate, Teradyne uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and economic environment at commencement date.
The ROU asset is initially measured as the amount of lease liability, adjusted for any initial lease costs, prepaid lease payments, and reduced by any lease incentives.
On January 30, 2019, Teradyne acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Lemsys SA (Lemsys) for a total purchase price of approximately $9.1 million.
As of the acquisition date, Teradynes preliminary purchase price allocation was goodwill of $1.2 million, which is not deductible for tax purposes, acquired intangible assets of $5.5 million with an average estimated useful life of 4.9 years, and $2.4 million of net tangible assets.
On April 25, 2018, Teradyne acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Mobile Industrial Robots Aps (MiR), a Danish limited liability company located in Odense, Denmark.

The allocation of the total purchase price to MiRs net tangible liabilities and identifiable intangible assets was based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.
Pro forma results for the three months ended April 1, 2018 were adjusted to exclude $0.6 million of acquisition related costs.
As of the acquisition date, Teradynes purchase price allocation was goodwill of $14.4 million which is deductible for tax purposes, acquired intangible assets of $12.3 million with an average estimated useful life of 7.7 years, and $1.0 million of net tangible assets.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, Teradyne also recognized $1.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively, of revenues from leases of Teradyne systems, which are accounted for outside of ASC 606.
