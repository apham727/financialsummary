The accompanying financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Teradynes Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 1, 2018, for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Teradyne adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.
Teradyne determines performance obligations by assessing whether the products or services are distinct from the other elements of the contract.
Transaction price is allocated to each individual performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of that performance obligation.
In order to determine the appropriate timing for revenue recognition, Teradyne first determines if the transaction meets any of three criteria for over time recognition.
If the transaction meets the criteria for over time recognition, Teradyne recognizes revenue as the good or service is delivered.
For transactions that do not meet the criteria for over time recognition, Teradyne will recognize revenue at a point in time based on an assessment of the five criteria for transfer of control.
Teradyne has concluded that revenue should be recognized when shipped or delivered based on contractual terms.
Typically acceptance of Teradynes products and services is a formality as Teradyne delivers similar systems, instruments and robots to standard specifications.
In cases where acceptance is not deemed a formality, Teradyne will defer revenue recognition until customer acceptance.
The following table provides information about disaggregated revenue by primary geographical market, major product line and timing of revenue recognition.
The extended warranty is purchased in the same transaction as the system or robot purchase and is classified as a separate performance obligation, which meets the criteria for over time recognition.Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which are not historical facts, so called forward-looking statements, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
