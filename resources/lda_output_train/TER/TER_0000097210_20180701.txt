The accompanying financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Teradynes Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 1, 2018, for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Teradyne adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.
Teradyne determines performance obligations by assessing whether the products or services are distinct from the other elements of the contract.
In order to determine the appropriate timing for revenue recognition, Teradyne first determines if the transaction meets any of three criteria for over time recognition.
For transactions that do not meet the criteria for over time recognition, Teradyne will recognize revenue at a point in time based on an assessment of the five criteria for transfer of control.
Typically acceptance of Teradynes products and services is a formality as Teradyne delivers similar systems, instruments and robots to standard specifications.
For the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, Teradyne also recognized $3.6 million and $7.9 million, respectively, in revenue on leases of Teradyne systems, which are accounted for outside of ASC 606.
The following table provides information about disaggregated revenue by primary geographical market, major product line and timing of revenue recognition.
Customers have the option to purchase an extended warranty, which extends the warranty period for systems and robots beyond the one-year standard warranty.
Teradyne sells training and applications support to customers either in standalone transactions or included with system purchases.
Training and applications support included in system orders are valued based on their standalone selling price and all training and applications support is recognized over time as the customer receives and consumes the benefit associated with each.
Teradyne provides support services for certain systems and robots outside of warranty.
Teradyne has estimated the standalone selling price for these services based on adjusted market assessments.
Customers typically pay for these services net 30 to 60 days from the date that transfer of control of the associated system or product occurs.
Teradyne has adopted the practical expedients available within ASC 340 Other Assets and Deferred Costs for contract assets, specifically in relation to incremental costs of obtaining a contract.
Teradyne has adopted the practical expedient, which states an entity need not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the entity expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.
Differences are the result of timing differences between the recognition of revenue under ASC 606 and ASC 605 primarily with respect to software transactions deferred due to lack of vendor specific objective evidence of price under ASC 605 and Teradynes assessment of acceptance under ASC 606.
Teradyne continues to record realized gains in interest income and realized losses in interest expense.
