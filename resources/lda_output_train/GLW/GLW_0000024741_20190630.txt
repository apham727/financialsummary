The Framework outlined our leadership priorities and articulated the opportunities we saw across our businesses.
Under the Framework, we targeted generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.
As of June 30, 2019, Corning met its goal of returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and is on track to invest $11 billion for growth and extended leadership.
From 2020 to 2023, the company plans to invest $10 billion to $12 billion for growth and to return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders.
Net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $2,940 million and $5,752 million, compared to $2,747 million and $5,247 million, respectively, during the same periods in 2018.
Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased $67 million and $245 million, respectively.
Growth from multi-year hyperscale data center projects drove the increase in enterprise sales in both periods.
The acquisition of 3M’s Communication Markets Division (“CMD”), which took place during the second quarter of 2018, also contributed to sales growth.
Higher costs of $33 million, primarily accelerated depreciation, within the Display Technologies segment.
Diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.69 per share when compared to the second quarter of 2018, driven by the decrease in net income described, offset by the repurchase of 35.8 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.53 per share when compared to the first half of 2018, driven by the increase in net income described above, offset by the repurchase of 35.8 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.
We believe 2019 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework and recently introduced Strategy and Growth Framework.
