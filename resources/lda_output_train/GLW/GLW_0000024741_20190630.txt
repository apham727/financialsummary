We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.
As of June 30, 2019, Corning met its goal of returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and is on track to invest $11 billion for growth and extended leadership.
From 2020 to 2023, the company plans to invest $10 billion to $12 billion for growth and to return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders.
Net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $2,940 million and $5,752 million, compared to $2,747 million and $5,247 million, respectively, during the same periods in 2018.
Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased $67 million and $245 million, respectively.
Growth from multi-year hyperscale data center projects drove the increase in enterprise sales in both periods.
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $68 million and $141 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, with volume increases in the mid-teens in percentage terms more than offsetting moderate price declines.
The increases in net income outlined above were offset by other net charges and credits of $20 million, primarily driven by accelerated depreciation within the Display Technologies segment and other corporate charges.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.
We believe 2019 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework and recently introduced Strategy and Growth Framework.
In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase by a low-to-mid-single digit percentage, including the impact of a full year of sales from the acquisition of CMD.
We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, the rate of which will depend on the adoption of our innovations.
We anticipate a mid-single digit percentage growth in sales for the Life Sciences segment.
Movements in foreign exchange rates decreased Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $34 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019, when compared to the prior year.
Movements in foreign exchange rates decreased Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $59 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019, when compared to the prior year.
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, gross margin decreased by $7 million and 1% and increased by $137 million or 7%, respectively.
When compared to the second quarter of 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses were similar in the three months ended June 30, 2019.
When compared to the first half of 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $98 million, or 11%, in the six months ended June 30, 2019.
As a percentage of sales, these expenses decreased by 1% and remained constant, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year.
Equity in earnings of affiliated companies for the six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased by $12 million, driven primarily by the absence of a gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018 resulting from a legal settlement.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated income before income taxes in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.
For the three months ended June 30, 2019 comprehensive income decreased by $152 million when compared to the same period in 2018, due to lower net income of $646 million offset by $466 million of positive impacts from the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses, driven primarily by the Japanese yen and Korean won.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019 comprehensive income increased by $515 million when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in net income of $442 million and $92 million of positive impacts from the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses, driven primarily by the euro and the Chinese yuan.
Corning utilizes constant-currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and new Taiwan dollar currencies.
Effective January 1, 2019, Corning also began using constant-currency reporting for our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments for the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan.
