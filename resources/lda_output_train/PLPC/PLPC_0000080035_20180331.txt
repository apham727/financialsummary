Basic earnings per share were computed by dividing Net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for each respective period.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, 12,000 and 33,350 stock options, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
The Company performs its annual impairment test for goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology, market comparables, and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit.

However, the Company believes that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units.
