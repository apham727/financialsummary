In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases. This ASU requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets related to the rights and obligations created by those leases. The ASU also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to the nature, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if “the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.” The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
During March 2016, the Company announced the shutdown of its Bioconnect division, which comprised the entire operations of the Medical Cabling and Interconnect segment. The closure is part of the Company’s ongoing plan to close or dispose of underperforming divisions that are not part of the Company’s core operations. For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2017, the Company recognized approximately $0 and $10,000 of income from sale of equipment for the Bioconnect division, respectively, which amounts have been included within discontinued operations. 
One vendor accounted for 46% of inventory purchases for the three months ended July 31, 2018. This same vendor accounted for 41% of inventory purchases for the nine months ended July 31, 2018. One vendor accounted for 11% of inventory purchases for the three months ended July 31, 2017. No vendor accounted for greater than 10% of inventory purchases for the nine months ended July 31, 2017. The Company has arrangements with these vendors to purchase products based on purchase orders periodically issued by the Company. 
The Company’s current stock incentive plan provides for the granting of qualified and nonqualified options to the Company’s officers, directors and employees. The Company satisfies the exercise of options by issuing previously unissued common shares. On July 17, 2017, the Company granted 100,000 incentive stock options to its newly hired President and Chief Executive Officer. These options, which expire in ten years from the date of grant, vested as to 10,000 shares on the date of grant, and the balance thereafter vests as to 10,000 shares per annum over the remaining nine years of the grant. On December 13, 2017, the Company granted 80,000 incentive stock options to an employee. These options vested 8,000 shares on the date of grant, and the balance vests as to 8,000 shares per year thereafter on each of the next nine anniversaries of December 13, 2017, and expire ten years from date of grant. No other options were granted to Company employees during the three and nine months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017. 
Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock price and other factors. The Company used the historical method to calculate the expected life of the 2018 and 2017 option grants. The expected life represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate with a maturity date corresponding to the options’ expected life. The dividend yield is based upon the historical dividend yield. 
Non-employee directors receive $50,000 annually, which is paid one-half in cash and one-half through the grant of non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. During the quarter ended January 31, 2018, the Company granted each of its five non-employee directors 37,927 non-qualified stock options. The number of stock options granted to each director was determined by dividing $25,000 by the fair value of a stock option grant using the Black-Scholes model ($0.659 per share). These options vest ratably over fiscal year 2018 and expires five year from the date of grant. During the quarter ended July 31, 2018, the Company did not grant any options. 
During the nine months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, stock-based compensation expense totaled $189,000 and $161,000, respectively. During the three months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, stock-based compensation expense totaled $57,000 and $62,000, respectively. For the nine months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, stock-based compensation classified in cost of sales amounted to $0 and $9,000, respectively, and stock-based compensation classified in selling and general expense amounted to $189,000 and $152,000, respectively. 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with high-credit quality financial institutions. At July 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of federally insured limits in the amount of approximately $10.5 million. 
One customer who is a distributor, accounted for approximately 56% of the Company’s net sales for the nine-month period ended July 31, 2018. This same customer accounted for approximately 51% of the Company’s net sales for the three-month period ended July 31, 2018. At July 31, 2018, this customer’s accounts receivable balance accounted for approximately 53% of the total net accounts receivable balance. For the nine-month period ended July 31, 2017, two customers, a distributor and data center solutions provider accounted for approximately 18% and 13% of the Company’s net sales, respectively. These same two customers accounted for approximately 22% and 11% of the Company’s net sales, respectively, for the three months ended July 31, 2017. At July 31, 2017, these customers’ accounts receivable balances accounted for approximately 26% and 10% of the Company’s total net accounts receivable balance, respectively. Although these customers have been on-going major customers of the Company, the written agreements with these customers do not have any minimum purchase obligations and they could stop buying the Company’s products at any time and for any reason. A reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from these customers or the loss of these customers could significantly reduce the Company’s future revenues and profits.  
The RF Connector and Cable Assembly segment consisted of one division and the Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment was composed of three divisions. The four divisions that met the quantitative thresholds for segment reporting are Connector and Cable Assembly, Cables Unlimited, Comnet and Rel-Tech. The specific customers are different for each division; however, there is some overlapping of product sales to them. The methods used to distribute products are similar within each division aggregated.  
As reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Company evaluates the performance of each segment based on income or loss before income taxes. The Company charges depreciation and amortization directly to each division within the segment. Accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets are the only assets identified by segment. Except as discussed above, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same for the Company as a whole.

The Company assesses property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which are considered definite-lived assets, for impairment. Definite-lived assets are reviewed when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. 
We test our goodwill and trademarks and indefinite-lived assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances requires significant judgment and could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition and sale or disposition of all or a portion of a division. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. 
The purchase agreement for the Rel-Tech acquisition provides for earn-out payments of up to $800,000, payable through May 31, 2018. As of July 31, 2018, the remaining earn-out obligation of $210,000 had not yet been paid out, however, subsequently in August 2018, the Company paid the $210,000 earn-out liability relieving the Company of its earn-out obligations. The initial earn-out liability was valued at its fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation and is included as a component of the total purchase price. The earn-out was revalued quarterly using a present value approach, and any resulting increase or decrease has been recorded into selling and general expenses. Any changes in the assumed timing and amount of the probability of payment scenarios could have impacted the fair value. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the earn-out as of the acquisition date. 
RF Industries, Ltd. (together with subsidiaries, the “Company”) is a national manufacturer and marketer of interconnect products and systems, including coaxial and specialty cables and connectors, fiber optic cables and connectors, and electrical and electronic specialty cables and components. Through its four manufacturing and production facilities, the Company provides a wide selection of interconnect products and solutions primarily to telecommunications carriers and equipment manufacturers, wireless and network infrastructure carriers and manufacturers, Data Center and Co-location companies, and to various original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in several market segments. 
Subsequent to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, the Company experienced a substantial increase in orders for its products in the Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment. As a result of these increased orders, the Company’s backlog had increased to $20.2 million as of January 31, 2018. During the quarter ended April 30, 2018, the Company filled most of the January 31, 2018 backlog, which contributed to the large sale increase for the three months ended April 30, 2018. Despite shipping most of the January 31, 2018 backlog in the three month period ended April 30, 2018, backlog stood at $9.5 million and $7.8 million, as of April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2018, respectively, as a result of additional new orders received during the second and third quarter. Since purchase orders are submitted from customers based on the timing of their requirements, the Company’s ability to predict orders in future periods or trends in future periods is limited. Furthermore, purchase orders may be subject to cancellation from customers, although the Company has not historically experienced material cancellations of purchase orders. As a result of the Company’s backlog balance as of July 31, 2018, the Company’s liquidity and available capital resources are expected to continue to improve during the balance of the current fiscal year. 
The Company generated cash of $5.6 million during the nine months ended July 31, 2018 due largely to the impact of increased sales, which resulted in net income of $5.4 million. An increase in accounts receivable ($2.0 million) and inventories ($0.7 million) were partially offset by increased accounts payable ($0.5 million) and accrued expenses ($1.2 million). This net decrease in cash was partially offset by an increase in cash from noncash credits of $0.6 million primarily from depreciation and amortization, and $0.2 million of stock-based compensation expense. In addition, during the nine months ended July 31, 2018, the Company received $1.0 million from the exercise of stock options and paid out $0.5 million in dividends. 
The Company does not anticipate needing material additional capital equipment in the next twelve months. In the past, the Company has financed some of its equipment and furnishings requirements through capital leases. No additional capital equipment purchases have been currently identified that would require significant additional leasing or capital expenditures during the next twelve months. Management also believes that based on the Company’s current financial condition, its current backlog of unfulfilled orders and its anticipated future operations, the Company would be able to finance its expansion, if necessary. 
Net sales of $13.9 million increased by 77%, or $6.0 million, for the three months ended July 31, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 quarter”) when compared to the three months ended July 31, 2017 (the “fiscal 2017 quarter”). Net sales for the fiscal 2018 quarter at the Company’s Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment (Custom Cabling) increased by $5.9 million, or 121%, when compared to the fiscal 2017 quarter as a result of increased sales of fiber optics cable, copper cabling, custom patch cord assemblies and wiring harnesses. The Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly segment saw an increase in new sales due, in large part, to project work in the OEM and wireless carrier markets in addition to an increase in traditional run rate business. Net sales for the fiscal 2018 quarter at the RF Connector and Cable Assembly segment (RF Connector) increased by $0.1 million, or 3%, to $3.1 million as compared to $3.0 million for the fiscal 2017 quarter. 
Selling and general expenses increased $0.3 million to $2.1 million compared to $1.8 million in the third quarter last year due to higher compensation related to the sales gains at Custom Cabling. Despite this increase in expenses, selling and general expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 15% of sales compared to 23% of sales in the third quarter last year indicating the Company’s increased operational efficiencies. 
For the fiscal 2018 quarter, income from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $1.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively, as compared to $30,000 and $0.2 million for the comparable third quarter last year. The increase in income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling and RF Connector segments was primarily due to the increase in sales. 
For the fiscal 2018 quarter, net income was $1.7 million and fully diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.18 per share as compared to a net income of $0.2 million and fully diluted EPS of $0.02 per share for the fiscal 2017 quarter. For the fiscal 2018 quarter, the diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 9,729,608 as compared to 8,915,794 for the fiscal 2017 quarter. 
The Company’s gross profit as a percentage of sales in the fiscal 2018 nine month period increased by 7% to 34% compared to 27% in the fiscal 2017 nine month period due primarily to the increased revenues at the Custom Cabling division. The improvement in gross margins was primarily due to the revenue increase at the Custom Cabling segment which had the effect of spreading certain fixed manufacturing costs over a larger revenue base.
