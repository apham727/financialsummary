The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on its consolidated financial statements.
The new guidance requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be presented in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, and allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization in assets.
If a separate line item is not used, the line item used in the income statement to present the other components of net benefit cost must be disclosed.
The update will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, using a modified retrospective approach.
