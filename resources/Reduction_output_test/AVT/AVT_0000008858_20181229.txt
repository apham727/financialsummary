Topic 606 supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance and requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services.
Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the consolidated statements of operations for the second quarter and six months ended December 29, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the second quarter and six months ended December 30, 2017 were not retrospectively adjusted, as such results were recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policy discussed under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date and as of and for the six months ended December 29, 2018.
For a nominal portion of the Company’s contracts where the accounting did change, the adoption of Topic 606 resulted in an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings of $2.0 million as of July 1, 2018.
For these contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the goods transfers through the manufacturing process, rather than when the goods are delivered, and title, risk and reward of ownership are passed to the customer, as under previous revenue recognition guidance.
The Company adopted this standard effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, which required changes to the classification of net periodic pension costs in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.
In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of hedge accounting compared to current GAAP.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on its consolidated financial statements.
Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replace revenue recognition policies discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Revenue is recognized at the point at which control of the underlying products are transferred to the customer, which includes determining whether products are distinct and separate performance obligations.
The Company does not have material product warranty obligations as the assurance type product warranties provided by the component manufacturers are passed through to the Company’s customers.
For contracts related to the specialized manufacture of products for customers with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, the Company recognizes revenue over time as control of the products transfer through the manufacturing process.
When the Company offers the right or has a history of accepting returns of product, historical experience is utilized to establish a liability for the estimate of expected returns and an asset for the right to recover the product expected to be returned.
In December 2018, the Company acquired Softweb Solutions (“Softweb”) a privately held software and artificial intelligence company that delivers software solutions for Internet of Things (IoT) applications and systems designed to increase efficiency, speed time to market, and help businesses transform.
In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Technology Solutions business (“TS business”) to Tech Data Corporation (the “Buyer”).
