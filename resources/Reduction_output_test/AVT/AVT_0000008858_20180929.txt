Topic 606 supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance and requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services.
Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 29, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the three months ended September 30, 2017 were not retrospectively adjusted, as such results were recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policy discussed under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date and as of and for the three months ended September 29, 2018.
For a nominal portion of the Company’s contracts where the accounting did change, the adoption of Topic 606 resulted in an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings of $2.0 million as of July 1, 2018.
For these contracts, the Company now recognizes revenue over time as control of the goods transfers through the manufacturing process, rather than when the goods are delivered, and title, risk and reward of ownership are passed to the customer, as under previous revenue recognition guidance.
The Company adopted this standard effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, which required changes to the classification of net periodic pension costs in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.
In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on its consolidated financial statements.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of Topic 842 on its consolidated financial statements and expects that most of its operating lease commitments related to the Company’s real estate portfolio will be subject to the new standard and recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption, which will materially increase total assets and total liabilities relative to such amounts prior to adoption.
Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replace revenue recognition policies discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s Fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were $5.09 billion, an increase of 9.2% from sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $4.66 billion.
Avnet operating income margin was 2.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared with 1.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Excluding these expenses from both periods, adjusted operating income margin was 3.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to 2.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were $5.09 billion, an increase of 9.2%, or $428.9 million, from the prior year first quarter sales of $4.66 billion.
EC sales of $4.71 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $403.6 million or 9.4% from the prior year first quarter sales of $4.31 billion.
PF sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were $379.1 million, an increase of $25.4 million or 7.2% from the prior year first quarter sales of $353.7 million driven by growth in all three regions.
As discussed in Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 did not have a material impact on the amounts of sales reported or the comparability of sales and gross profit margins year over year.As a result primarily of certain former manufacturing operations, Avnet has incurred and may have future liability under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing pollution and exposure to, and the handling, storage and disposal of, hazardous substances.
