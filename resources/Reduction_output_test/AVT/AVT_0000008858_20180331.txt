The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2017.
The new guidance requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be presented in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, and allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization in assets.
If a separate line item is not used, the line item used in the income statement to present the other components of net benefit cost must be disclosed.
The update will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, using a modified retrospective approach.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.
For the revenue streams assessed, the Company does not anticipate a material impact in the timing or amount of revenue recognized.
In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Technology Solutions (“TS”) business to Tech Data Corporation (the “Buyer”).
Included in the gain on sale recorded upon completion of the sale were estimates for certain income taxes due on the gain and additional cash consideration expected from the Buyer related to a closing date net working capital sales price adjustment (the “closing date adjustment”).
The Company is finalizing the closing date adjustment with the Buyer as provided for in the sales agreement and has included an estimate of this amount as primary component of the $305.1 million of prepaid and other current assets as of March 31, 2018.
The final closing date adjustment, as determined through the established process outlined in the sales agreement, may be materially different from the Company’s estimate.Sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $4.80 billion, an increase of 8.0% from sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 of $4.44 billion.
Avnet operating loss margin was (1.1)% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared with 2.6% of operating income margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Excluding these expenses from both periods, adjusted operating income margin was 3.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to 3.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
The following table presents the reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
Sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $4.80 billion, an increase of 8.0%, or $353.2 million, from the prior year third quarter sales of $4.44 billion.
EC sales of $4.40 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $313.2 million or 7.7% from the prior year third quarter sales of $4.09 billion.
This increase was primarily driven by increased sales in Asia due to organic growth and in EMEA primarily due to the benefit from the weakening of the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by declines in the Americas region due to supplier channel and program changes.As a result primarily of certain former manufacturing operations, Avnet has incurred and may have future liability under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing pollution and exposure to, and the handling, storage and disposal of, hazardous substances.
