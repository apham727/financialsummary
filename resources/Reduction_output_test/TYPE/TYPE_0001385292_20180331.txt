The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of March 31, 2018 and for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) for interim financial reporting and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
In managements opinion, these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements contain all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements for the interim periods presented.
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, as reported in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Companys significant accounting policies and practices are as described in the Annual Report, except for the adoption of the accounting standards described in Note 3 below.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606), which outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on principle that replaces virtually all existing revenue recognition rules under U.S. GAAP and which requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
The standard requires retrospective application; however, it allows entities to choose either full retrospective adoption, in which the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective adoption, in which the cumulative catch-up adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings is recognized at the date of application, with additional disclosures required to describe these effects.
We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, and applied the modified retrospective method of adoption and have elected to apply the new standard only to contracts not completed at January 1, 2018, which represents contracts for which all (or substantially all) of the revenues have not been recognized under existing guidance as of the date of adoption.
These amounts are included in cost of revenue  license in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
   Under legacy GAAP, revenue related to our term licenses that were bundled with service-related performance obligations when vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) did not exist was required to be recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
The application of this provision is particularly impactful to our new Mosaic product offering which was launched in the first quarter of 2018.
   We have a limited number of contracts in which we offered extended payment terms for term licenses to our customers, including cases in which the license is delivered in full at the beginning of the contract.
Under legacy GAAP, revenue was recognized when the payments became due, based upon the requirement that the fee be fixed or determinable.

For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 56.2% and 55.0%, respectively, of our total revenue.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 23.0% and 31.3% of our total revenue, respectively.
Our gross profit is subject to variability from period-to-period, depending on the product mix and the level of custom font design and SaaS based service revenue.
License revenue increased primarily due to the growth in sales of revenue from our enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic product offering, partially offset by decreases due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
Additionally, we recorded lower royalty based revenue as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.
This change had the effect of shifting traditional holiday seasonality revenue for consumer electronics from the first quarter to the fourth quarter.
While revenue from services has grown to a level of significance requiring separate disclosure, we continue to operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.
The following discussion compares the three months ended March 31, 2018 with the three months ended March 31, 2017.
