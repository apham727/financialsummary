The Companys significant accounting policies and practices are as described in the Annual Report, except for the adoption of the accounting standards described in Note 3 below.
A highly inflationary economy is one where the cumulative inflation rate for the three years preceding the beginning of the reporting period, including interim reporting periods, is in excess of 100 percent.
For a highly inflationary economy, we followed the guidance in ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters, (Subtopic ASC 830-10-45) and accounted for the change in functional currency from the Argentinian peso to the U.S. dollar effective July 1, 2018.
Under this guidance, translation adjustments are not removed from equity, and the translated amounts for nonmonetary assets and liabilities at the end of the prior period become the accounting basis for those assets both in the period of the change and in subsequent periods.For the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 54.5% and 53.8%, respectively, of our total revenue.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 55.3% and 56.3%, respectively, of our total revenue.
For the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 26.9% and 27.5% of our total revenue, respectively.
License revenue decreased primarily due to certain one-time printer revenue recognized in the third quarter of 2017, as a result of conversion of customers to fixed fee contracts from royalty bearing contracts.
In addition, our royalty based revenue is lower in the three months ended September 30, 2018, as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.
Service revenue has increased primarily due to the growth of our SaaS-based product offerings, including our Mosaic solution.
See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.
Revenue was $58.0 million and $60.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $2.5 million, or 4.2%.
Creative Professional revenue was $36.1 million and $34.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $1.6 million, or 4.6%, mainly due to growth in sales to enterprise customers and increased service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our portfolio.Deposits of cash held outside the United States totaled approximately $29.5 million and $24.3 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.From time to time, we may be a party to various claims, suits and complaints.
