For purposes of this report, “KLA,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” or similar references mean KLA Corporation, and its majority-owned subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise.
The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the periods indicated.
The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
Acquisition of Orbotech, Ltd. On February 20, 2019 (the “Closing Date” or “Acquisition Date”), we completed the acquisition of Orbotech, Ltd. (“Orbotech”) for total consideration of $3.26 billion.
The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report include the financial results of Orbotech prospectively from the Acquisition Date.
For additional details, refer to Note 6 “Business Combinations” of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Prior periods were not retrospectively restated, and accordingly, the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2019, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2018 were prepared using accounting standards that were different than those in effect for the three months ended September 30, 2019.
Under ASC 842, a contract is or contains a lease when we have the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time.
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to, and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations.
On the commencement date leases are evaluated for classification and assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
Variable lease payments, consisting primarily of reimbursement of costs incurred by lessors for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and insurance are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred.
We have elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for the majority of our asset classes.
Consistent with ASC 840, leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statements of operations.
In July 2018, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which amended ASC 842 and offered an additional (and optional) transition method by which entities could elect not to recast the comparative periods presented in financial statements in the period of adoption.
KLA adopted the new standard on July 1, 2019, the first day of fiscal 2020, using the optional adoption method whereby we did not adjust comparative period financial statements.

•The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, which exposes our business and operating results to increased volatility tied to individual customers.
Many of our large customers have more aggressive policies regarding engaging alternative, second-source suppliers for the products we offer and, in addition, may seek and, on occasion, receive pricing, payment, intellectual property-related or other commercial terms that may have an adverse impact on our business.
Any future change in ownership or management of our existing customers may result in similar challenges, including the possibility of the successor entity or new management deciding to select a competitor’s products.
•The highly concentrated business environment also increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each of our customers.
For example, as a result of the challenging economic environment during fiscal year 2009, we were (and in some cases continue to be) exposed to additional risks related to the continued financial viability of certain of our customers.
To the extent our customers experience liquidity issues in the future, we may be required to incur additional bad debt expense with respect to receivables owed to us by those customers.
Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for that specific production line application and other similar production line applications if that customer initially selects a competitor’s equipment.
The purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the condition of the industry worldwide.
