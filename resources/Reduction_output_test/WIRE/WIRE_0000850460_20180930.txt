The unaudited consolidated financial statements of Encore Wire Corporation (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
We review and update these estimates regularly and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative U.S. GAAP other than Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants.
The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs.
On January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of ASC 606 and all the related amendments to all of our contracts using the modified retrospective method.
Upon completing our implementation assessment of ASC 606, we concluded that no adjustment was required to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of initial application.
Companies that elect this option would record a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.

The tables below highlight the range of closing prices of copper on a per pound basis on the Comex exchange for the periods shown.
The following discussion and analysis relate to factors that have affected the operating results of the Company for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
Net sales were $340.7 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $292.0 million in the third quarter of 2017.
This 16.7% increase in net sales dollars is primarily the result of a 17.1% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 16.1% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped and a 0.9% increase in the average selling price of copper wire.
Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period.
Cost of goods sold was $286.2 million, or 84.0% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018, compared to $252.9 million, or 86.6% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2017.
Gross profit increased to $54.5 million, or 16.0% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018 from $39.1 million, or 13.4% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2017.
The increase in gross profit margin percentage was driven principally by the increase of the copper wire spread.For information on the Company’s legal proceedings, see Note 8 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
