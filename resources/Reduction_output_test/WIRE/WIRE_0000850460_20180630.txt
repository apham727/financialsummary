The unaudited consolidated financial statements of Encore Wire Corporation (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
We review and update these estimates regularly and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative U.S. GAAP other than Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants.
The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs.
On January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of ASC 606 and all the related amendments to all of our contracts using the modified retrospective method.
Upon completing our implementation assessment of ASC 606, we concluded that no adjustment was required to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of initial application.
During the first three quarters of every year, LIFO calculations are based on the inventory levels and costs at that time.
In the second quarter of 2018, LIFO adjustments were recorded, increasing cost of sales by $1.7 million, versus LIFO adjustments decreasing cost of sales by $0.4 million in the second quarter of 2017.The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.
The tables below highlight the range of closing prices of copper on a per pound basis on the Comex exchange for the periods shown.
The following discussion and analysis relates to factors that have affected the operating results of the Company for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.
Reference should also be made to the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Net sales were $336.8 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $291.5 million in the second quarter of 2017.
This 15.5% increase in net sales dollars is primarily the result of a 17.4% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 17.2% increase in the average selling price of copper wire and a 0.1% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped.
Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased increased 18.7% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 and was the principal driver of the increased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $292.3 million, or 86.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018, compared to $255.7 million, or 87.7% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2017.
Gross profit increased to $44.5 million, or 13.2% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018 versus $35.9 million, or 12.3% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2017.For information on the Company’s legal proceedings, see Note 8 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
