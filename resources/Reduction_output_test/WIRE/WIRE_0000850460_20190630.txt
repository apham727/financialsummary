The unaudited financial statements of Encore Wire Corporation (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.
We review and update these estimates regularly and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) is the sole source of authoritative U.S. GAAP other than Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants.
The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” on January 1, 2019, the Company recorded $0.7 million of right of use assets which are included in other non-current assets, $0.2 million of current lease liabilities which are included in accounts payable and $0.5 million of long-term lease liabilities included in other non-current liabilities.
During the first three quarters of every year, LIFO calculations are based on the inventory levels and costs at that time.
In the second quarter of 2019, LIFO adjustments were recorded, decreasing cost of sales by $3.3 million, versus LIFO adjustments increasing cost of sales by $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2018.
Income taxes were accrued at an effective rate of 23.2% in the second quarter of 2019 versus 22.7% in the second quarter of 2018, consistent with the Company’s estimated liabilities.
Earnings per common and common equivalent share are computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during each period.

The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.
The tables below highlight the range of closing prices of copper on a per pound basis on the Comex exchange for the periods shown.
The following discussion and analysis relate to factors that have affected the operating results of the Company for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
Net sales were $336.9 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $336.8 million in the second quarter of 2018.
The virtually identical net sales dollars are primarily the result of a 5.6% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset by a 6.1% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period.
The 5.6% increase in unit volume shipped was primarily due to strong construction industry demand despite rough spring weather in certain areas that slowed construction and impacted volumes in the second quarter of 2019.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 8.7% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $291.0 million, or 86.4% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $292.3 million, or 86.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018.
Gross profit increased to $45.9 million, or 13.6% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2019 from $44.5 million, or 13.2% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018.
Unit volumes increased 5.6%, while the spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sales price for a pound of copper contained in finished wire decreased 0.4% in the second quarter of 2019 versus the second quarter of 2018.
The spread decreased as a result of the average sales price per pound of copper sold decreasing 6.1% while the per pound cost of raw copper purchased decreased 8.7%.
The final results of the U.S. Government’s ongoing antidumping and countervailing duty investigations are not expected until the end of the year.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, decreased to 74.6% of net sales in the second quarter of 2019, from 76.4% of net sales in the second quarter of 2018.
As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis and makes a monthly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO.
Net sales for the first six months of 2019 were $651.6 million compared to net sales of $628.2 million for the first six months of 2018.
This 3.7% increase in net sales is primarily the result of a 2.8% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 9.3% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, partially offset by a 5.9% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
