2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” on January 1, 2019, the Company recorded $0.7 million of right of use assets which are included in other non-current assets in the accompanying balance sheet, $0.2 million of current lease liabilities which are included in accounts payable and $0.5 million of long-term lease liabilities included in other non-current liabilities.Copper accounted for approximately 73.0%, 69.7%, and 65.2% of the Company’s cost of goods sold during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.
The tables below highlight the range of closing prices of copper on a per pound basis on the Comex exchange for the periods shown.
Reference should also be made to the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Net sales were $314.7 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $291.4 million in the first quarter of 2018.
This 8.0% increase in net sales dollars is primarily the result of a 13.5% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset somewhat by a 5.9% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period.
The 13.5% increase in unit volume shipped was primarily due to particularly rough winter weather that slowed construction and impacted volumes in the first quarter of 2018, particularly in January.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 9.6% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $273.4 million, or 86.9% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2019, compared to $253.9 million, or 87.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018.For information on the Company’s legal proceedings, see Note 8 to the Company’s financial statements included in Item 1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
