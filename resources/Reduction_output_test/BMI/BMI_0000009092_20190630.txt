The consolidated condensed balance sheet at December 31, 2018 was derived from amounts included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
For the frozen pension plan, benefits were based primarily on years of service and, for certain individuals, levels of compensation.
In 2018, the Company completed the termination of the non-contributory defined benefit pension plan.
The Company maintains supplemental non-qualified plans for certain officers and other key employees, and an Employee Savings and Stock Ownership Plan for the majority of the U.S. employees.
The Company disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 that it estimated it would pay $0.4 million in other postretirement benefits in 2019 based on actuarial estimates.
The amount of benefits paid in calendar year 2019 will not impact the expense for postretirement benefits for 2019.
On April 2, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Innovative Metering Solutions, Inc. (IMS) of Odessa, Florida, which was one of the Company's distributors serving Florida.
The total purchase consideration was approximately $12.0 million, which included $7.7 million in cash, a $0.3 million working capital adjustment, a balance sheet holdback of $0.7 million and settlement of $3.3 million of pre-existing Company receivables.
The working capital adjustment was settled in the second quarter of 2018 and the balance sheet holdback was paid in the second quarter of 2019.
The Company's allocation of the purchase price at March 31, 2019 included $3.8 million of receivables, $0.8 million of inventories, $0.1 million of machinery and equipment, $3.6 million of intangibles and $3.7 million of goodwill.The largest geographic market for the Company’s municipal water products is North America, primarily the United States, because most of the Company's meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the American Water Works Association.
The majority of water meters sold by the Company continue to be mechanical in nature; however, ultrasonic meters are gaining in penetration due to a variety of factors, including their ability to maintain near absolute measurement accuracy over their useful life.
Meters equipped with radio technology (endpoints) receive flow measurement data from battery-powered encoder registers attached to the water meter, which is encrypted and transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility usage and billing systems.
These remotely read systems are classified as either automatic meter reading (AMR) systems, where a vehicle equipped for meter reading purposes, including a radio receiver, computer and reading software, collects the data from utilities’ meters; or advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems, where data is gathered utilizing a network (either fixed or cellular) of data collectors or gateway receivers that are able to receive radio data transmission from the utilities’ meters.
Benefits to the utility include improved customer service, increased visibility through faster leak detection, the ability to promote and quantify the effects of its water conservation efforts, and easier compliance reporting.
Water meter replacement and the adoption and deployment of new technology comprise the majority of water meter product sales, including radio products.
The Company’s proprietary radio products (i.e. Flow instrumentation products are used in flow measurement and control applications across a broad industrial spectrum, occasionally leveraging the same technologies used in the municipal water category.
A leader in both mechanical and static (ultrasonic) flow metering technologies for industrial markets, the Company offers one of the broadest flow measurement, control and communication portfolios in the market.
There are approximately 52,000 water utilities in the United States and the Company estimates that approximately 60% of them have converted to a radio solution.
