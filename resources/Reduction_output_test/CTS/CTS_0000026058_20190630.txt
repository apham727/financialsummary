The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by CTS Corporation (“CTS” "we", "our", "us" or the "Company”), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year.
The lease liability is based on the present value of minimum lease payments discounted using our secured incremental borrowing rate at the date of adoption.
Existing deferred rent liabilities, resulting from our historical practice of using the straight line method for recognizing lease expense, were reclassified upon adoption to reduce the measurement of the lease assets.
We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which among other things, allows us to carry forward the historical accounting relating to lease identification and classification for existing leases at adoption.
Our contracts normally contain a single performance obligation that is fulfilled on the date of delivery based on shipping terms stipulated in the contract.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, we recognized revenues of $37 and $106, respectively, for amounts that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
The amendment added an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which have now been consolidated into a single facility.
The total restructuring liability related to severance and other one-time benefit arrangements under the June 2016 Plan was $501 at June 30, 2019, and $668 at December 31, 2018.
On February 12, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated five-year Credit Agreement with a group of banks (the "Credit Agreement") to extend the term of the facility.
The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $300,000, which may be increased by $150,000 at the request of the Company, subject to the administrative agent's approval.

Sales were $120,684 in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of $2,663 or 2.3% from the second quarter of 2018.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 34.1% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 35.4% in the second quarter of 2018.
Execution challenges in our ceramic foundry operation as well as material cost and wage increases were the main drivers for the decline.
These were partially offset by savings related to the manufacturing transition from Elkhart, Indiana and other cost improvements.
Research and development expenses were $6,257 or 5.2% of sales in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $6,476 or 5.5% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2018.
Restructuring charges were $911 or 0.8% of sales in the second quarter of 2019.
The charges were mainly for building and equipment relocation, severance, and travel costs related to the restructuring of certain operations as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan.
Restructuring charges were $1,172 or 1.0% of sales in the second quarter of 2018.
Operating earnings were $17,083 or 14.2% of sales in the second quarter of 2019 compared to operating earnings of $14,544 or 12.3% of sales in the second quarter of 2018.
Interest expense decreased mainly as a result of the reduction in debt year-over-year and a reduction in interest related to interest rate swaps.
Other expense in the second quarter of 2019 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi during the quarter, as well as pension expense.
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared with the same period in 2018, was primarily attributed to the 2018 withholding tax payment of $1,703 on a one-time distribution from Taiwan.
