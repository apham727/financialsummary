The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by CTS Corporation (“CTS” "we", "our", "us" or the "Company”), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year.
The lease liability is based on the present value of minimum lease payments discounted using our secured incremental borrowing rate at the date of adoption.
Existing deferred rent liabilities, resulting from our historical practice of using the straight line method for recognizing lease expense, were reclassified upon adoption to reduce the measurement of the lease assets.
We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which among other things, allows us to carry forward the historical accounting relating to lease identification and classification for existing leases at adoption.
Our contracts normally contain a single performance obligation that is fulfilled on the date of delivery based on shipping terms stipulated in the contract.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, we recognized revenues of $125 and $231, respectively, for amounts that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
The amendment added an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which have now been consolidated into a single facility.
Beginning in Q3 2019, we incurred restructuring charges of $1,671 for exit and disposal activities at three facilities, of which $800 was related to a lease termination charge resulting from our acquisition of Quality Thermistor, Inc. (see Note 19) and $871 was related to workforce and building relocation costs at two foreign facilities.
On February 12, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated five-year Credit Agreement with a group of banks (the "Credit Agreement") to extend the term of the facility.
The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $300,000, which may be increased by $150,000 at the request of the Company, subject to the administrative agent's approval.

Sales were $115,651 in the third quarter of 2019, a decrease of $3,208 or 2.7% from the third quarter of 2018.
Sales to other markets increased $417 or 1.0% due to the addition of sales from the QTI acquisition.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 32.0% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to 35.4% in the third quarter of 2018.
These were partially offset by savings related to the manufacturing transition from Elkhart, Indiana and other cost improvements.
Research and development expenses were $6,806 or 5.9% of sales in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $6,517 or 5.5% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2018.
Restructuring charges were $2,342 or 2.0% of sales in the third quarter of 2019.
The charges were mainly for building and equipment relocation, severance, and asset impairment charges related to the restructuring of certain operations as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan, as well as a lease termination fee related to a property lease we acquired in the QTI acquisition.
Restructuring charges were $997 or 0.8% of sales in the third quarter of 2018.
Operating earnings were $10,124 or 8.8% of sales in the third quarter of 2019 compared to operating earnings of $16,118 or 13.6% of sales in the third quarter of 2018.
Other expense in the third quarter of 2019 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi during the quarter, as well as pension expense.
The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared with the same period in 2018 is primarily attributed to the net impact of changes in reserves relating to uncertain tax positions.
Sales were $353,959 in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, an increase of $3,549 or 1.0% from the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
