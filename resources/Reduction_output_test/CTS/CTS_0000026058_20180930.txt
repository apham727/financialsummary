The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by CTS Corporation (“CTS” "we", "our", "us" or the "Company”), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year.
Beginning in January 2018, CTS adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" under the modified retrospective method, which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.
At date of adoption, there was no significant change to our past revenue recognition practices and therefore no adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings was required.
Our contracts normally contain a single performance obligation that is fulfilled on the date of delivery based on shipping terms stipulated in the contract.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, we recognized a decrease of revenues of $18 and an increase of $68, respectively, that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
The increase in contract liabilities as of September 30, 2018 is primarily due to net increases in estimated future discounts and price concessions, offset by net settlements of products sold with rights of return.
In June 2016, we announced plans to restructure operations by phasing out production at our Elkhart facility by the end of 2018 and transitioning it into a research and development center supporting our global operations ("June 2016 Plan").
The amendment added an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which will be consolidated into a single facility.
The total cost of the plan is expected to be approximately $13,400.
The total restructuring liability related to severance and other one-time benefit arrangements under the June 2016 Plan was $1,044 at September 30, 2018, and $1,460 at December 31, 2017.
The remaining restructuring liability related to the April 2014 Plan was $440 at September 30, 2018, and $453 at December 31, 2017.
Due to the inherent nature of environmental obligations, we cannot provide assurance that our ultimate environmental liability will not materially exceed the amount of its current reserve.
On May 23, 2016, we requested and received a $100,000 increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments under the existing credit agreement, which increased the credit line from $200,000 to $300,000.
The Revolving Credit Facility includes a swing line sublimit of $15,000 and a letter of credit sublimit of $10,000.
We have debt issuance costs related to our long-term debt that are being amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the debt.
