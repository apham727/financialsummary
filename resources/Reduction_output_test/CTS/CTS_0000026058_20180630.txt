The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by CTS Corporation (“CTS” "we", "our", "us" or the "Company”), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year.
Beginning in January 2018, CTS adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" under the modified retrospective method, which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.
At date of adoption, there was no significant change to our past revenue recognition practices and therefore no adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings was required.
Our contracts normally contain a single performance obligation that is fulfilled on the date of delivery based on shipping terms stipulated in the contract.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we recognized a decrease of revenues of $46 and an increase in revenues of $86, respectively, that were included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
The increase in contract liabilities as of June 30, 2018 is primarily due to net increases in estimated future discounts and price concessions, offset by net settlements of products sold with rights of return.
In June 2016, we announced plans to restructure operations by phasing out production at our Elkhart facility by the end of 2018 and transitioning it into a research and development center supporting our global operations ("June 2016 Plan").
The amendment added an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which will be consolidated into a single facility.
The total cost of the plan is expected to be approximately $13,400.Sales were $118,021 in the second quarter of 2018, an increase of $12,335 or 11.7% from the second quarter of 2017.
The Noliac acquisition, which was completed in May 2017, added $2,508 in sales in the second quarter of 2018 and $1,543 in the second quarter of 2017.
Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by $1,794 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar depreciating compared to the Euro and Chinese Renminbi and relating mostly to sales of transportation products.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 35.4% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to 33.9% in the second quarter of 2017.
Major drivers for the improvement include savings related to product line transfers and favorable foreign exchange impact.
The second quarter of 2017 also included costs related to certain production rework issues resolved in the first quarter of 2017.
Research and development expenses were $6,476 or 5.5% of sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $6,049 or 5.7% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2017.
Restructuring charges were $1,172 or 1.0% of sales in the second quarter of 2018.
