The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist.
The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.
The impact of adopting the new standard was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Upon adoption, we recorded a decrease to retained earnings of $6,451, net of a tax impact of $3,071, as of September 1, 2018.
The impact of adopting the new standard for the three months ended November 30, 2018 was an increase to revenues of approximately $11.4 million.
The impact on our balance sheet as of November 30, 2018 was not material with the exception of the classification of $2.1 billion of receivables and $572.3 million of contract assets, which were previously classified as Unbilled services, net.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the client and is the unit of accounting in Topic 606.
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price.
If a contract modification results in the addition of performance obligations priced at a standalone selling price or if the post-modification services are distinct from the services provided prior to the modification, the modification is accounted for separately.
If the modified services are not distinct, they are accounted for as part of the existing contract.
Many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts.
We include these variable fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee and it is not probable a significant reversal of revenue will occur.

We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.
•Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.
•As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges.
The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, U.K. pound and Japanese yen.
Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation.
For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower.
The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 2% lower than our revenue growth in local currency.
Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2019, we estimate that our full fiscal 2019 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
