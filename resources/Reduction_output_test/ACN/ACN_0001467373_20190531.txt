Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges.
The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, U.K. pound and Japanese yen.
For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher.
The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 5% and 4% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was 30.7% compared with 30.4% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018.
The increase in gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The increase in gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was primarily due to lower non-payroll and labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2018.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 16.0% for the nine months ended May 31, 2019, compared with 15.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 15.8% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points.
Operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was 14.7%, compared with 14.5% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018.

For the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded a tax charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $41 million and $178 million, respectively.
Absent these charges and $81 million of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 26.8% and 21.3%, respectively.
Diluted earnings per share were $5.62 for the nine months ended May 31, 2019, compared with $4.76 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018.
