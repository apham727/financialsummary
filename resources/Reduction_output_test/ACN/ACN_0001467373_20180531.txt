The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017.
The results of operations for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2018.
As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist.
In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders.
Depreciation expense was $101,814 and $315,410 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, and $86,148 and $255,807 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively.

Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges.
The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
The majority of our net revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro and the U.K. pound.
The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 5% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency.
Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 32.2%, compared with 32.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was 31.3%, compared with 31.7% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
The decrease in gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was principally due to higher labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2017 as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by other cost efficiencies and improved contract profitability in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 16.4% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with 17.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and 16.7% for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
For the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 40 basis points, principally due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 50 basis points.
For the nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues each decreased 10 basis points.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded a $510 million pension settlement charge and related $198 million reduction in taxes for the U.S. pension plan termination.
For additional information, see Note 8 (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of net revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 15.7%, compared with 9.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
Excluding the effect of the pension settlement charge, operating margin for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 would have been 15.5% and 15.0%, respectively.
The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 were 19.4% and 20.2%, respectively.
For the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded a provisional tax charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) of $41 million and $178 million, respectively.
Absent these charges and $81 million of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 26.8% and 21.3%, respectively.
Diluted earnings per share were $4.76 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared with $3.96 for the nine months ended May 31, 2017.
The impact of tax law changes decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.19 and $0.40 during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively.
Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.79 and $1.52 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively and $5.16 and $4.43 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist.
