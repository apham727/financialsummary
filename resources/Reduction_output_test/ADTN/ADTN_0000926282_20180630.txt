The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of ADTRAN®, Inc. and its subsidiaries (ADTRAN) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations for reporting on Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these interim statements have been recorded and are of a normal and recurring nature.
The interim statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed on February 23, 2018 with the SEC.
Our more significant estimates include the obsolete and excess inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination of the deferred revenue components of multiple element sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred revenues, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments, and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments.
ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity's leasing arrangements.
In connection with the adoption of the new revenue standard, effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs – Contracts with Customers, with respect to capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract.
The primary effect was the capitalization of certain sales commissions for our extended maintenance and support contracts in excess of one year and amortization of those costs over the period that the related revenue is recognized.
We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which is subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties.
The transfer of these assets to ADTRAN, which included key customer relationships and a required assumption by ADTRAN of relatively low incremental expenses, along with the value of the technology license and OEM supply agreement, resulted in the bargain purchase gain.
Aside from revising the 2017 and 2018 net income for the effect of the bargain purchase gain, there were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to this acquisition.
Revenue is measured based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied.
Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of a product or service to the customer.
The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which we sell the separate products and services and are allocated based on each item’s relative value to the total value of the products and services in the arrangement.
Costs of obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized over the period that the related revenue is recognized if greater than one year.
The following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate our revenue by reportable segment.

As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 54.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to 61.0% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and increased from 55.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to 63.9% in the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, increased from 51.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 to 60.5% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and increased from 52.3% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 to 62.7% in the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program, an increase in warranty expense due to a settlement in first quarter of 2017 with a third party supplier for a defective component and purchase discounts received from a contract manufacturer in the first quarter of 2017.
