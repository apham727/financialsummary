The primary impact will be accelerated revenue recognition for certain performance obligations related to service revenue arrangements that were previously deferred until customer acceptance and capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract as described below.
In connection with the adoption of the new revenue standard, effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers, with respect to capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract.
The primary impact was capitalization of certain sales commissions for our extended maintenance and support contracts in excess of one year and amortization of those costs over the period that the related revenue is recognized.
We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which is subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties.
The transfer of these assets to ADTRAN, which included key customer relationships and required assumption by ADTRAN of relatively low incremental expenses, along with the value of the technology license and OEM supply agreement, resulted in the bargain purchase gain.Sales were $120.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $170.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Our gross margin decreased to 32.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2018 from 43.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Our operating income margin decreased to (22.1)% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 4.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Net income (loss) was $(10.8) million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Our effective tax rate, excluding the effect of the bargain purchase gain in 2018, decreased to 15.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 20.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Earnings (loss) per share, assuming dilution, were $(0.22) for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.14 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.Although these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit worthiness of these financial institutions, and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such credit risk to be minimal.
