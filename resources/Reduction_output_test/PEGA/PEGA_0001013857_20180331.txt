Pegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding interim financial reporting.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) using the full retrospective method which required each prior reporting period presented to be adjusted to reflect the application of this ASU.
2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model for credit losses.
Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of other-than-temporary impairments.
The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets, recognizing a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.
The Company adopted ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 on January 1, 2018 using the full retrospective method, which required the Company to retrospectively adjust the prior periods presented.
Previously the Company recognized revenue over the term of the agreements as payments became due or earlier if prepaid.
Any unrecognized license revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period that control transfers, as either a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of December 31, 2015 or as revenue in periods thereafter.

We develop, market, license, and support software applications for customer engagement and digital process automation, in addition to licensing our Pega Platform application development product for clients that wish to build and extend their own applications.
Our strategy is to sell a client a series of licenses, each focused on a specific purpose or area of operations in support of longer term enterprise-wide digital transformation initiatives.
The decrease in total revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to a large term license arrangement recognized in revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and a shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements.
Cloud arrangements are generally recognized in revenue over the term of the cloud contract, as compared to other arrangements, which are generally recognized in revenue on the contract effective date.
The change in ACV measures the growth and predictability of future cash flows from committed term, cloud, and maintenance arrangements as of the end of the particular reporting period.
   The sum of the annual value of each term and cloud contract in effect on such date, with the annual value of a term or cloud contract being equal to the total value of the contract divided by the total number of years of the contract.
Thus, we estimate stand-alone selling price for software licenses and cloud performance obligations using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price minus the stand-alone selling price of other performance obligations promised in the contract.
In applying our revenue recognition policy, we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred and recognized in future periods.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data both of which are contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The decrease in perpetual license revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in the value of perpetual arrangements executed in the three months ended March 31, 2018 driven primarily by a shift in client preferences to cloud arrangements.
