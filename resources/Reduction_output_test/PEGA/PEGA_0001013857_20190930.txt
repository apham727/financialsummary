The increase in term license revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2019 was due to revenue recognized from several large, multi-year term license contracts in the three months ended September 30, 2019.
The decrease in term license revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was attributable to revenue recognized from term license contracts in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 with multi-year committed maintenance periods, which resulted in a greater portion of the contract value being allocated to maintenance.
The increases in maintenance revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were primarily due to the continued growth in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software and strong renewal rates in excess of 90%.

The decrease in total gross profit in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in term and perpetual license revenue and a decrease in consulting revenue due to a decrease in billable hours.
The decrease in total gross profit percent in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was driven by the shift in client preferences in favor of cloud arrangements, which are lower margin than our term and perpetual license revenue streams and decreases in cloud and consulting gross profit percent.
The decreases in cloud gross profit percent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were driven by an increase in costs as we accelerated our investments in cloud infrastructure and service delivery to support future growth.
