The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
GAAP”) for complete financial statements.
In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders.
As of February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018, total accumulated depreciation was $2,027,164 and $1,862,098, respectively.
See Note 6 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for intangible asset amortization balances.
On September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance.
The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.
Prior period results have been revised to reflect this change in presentation.
The impact of adopting the new standard was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Upon adoption, we recorded a decrease to retained earnings of $6,451, net of a tax impact of $3,071, as of September 1, 2018.
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
While determining relative standalone selling price and identifying separate performance obligations require judgment, generally relative standalone selling prices and the separate performance obligations are readily identifiable as we sell those performance obligations unaccompanied by other performance obligations.

We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31.
For example, a reference to “fiscal 2019” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2019.
All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates.
•Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.
•Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges.
The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis.
There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, U.K. pound and Japanese yen.
