The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
GAAP”) for complete financial statements.
We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
See Note 6 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for intangible asset amortization balances.
Enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements are also required.
We elected the package of practical expedients which does not require reassessment of prior conclusions related to identifying leases, lease classification or initial direct costs.
The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice.
Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31.
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance.
Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates.
Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate.
