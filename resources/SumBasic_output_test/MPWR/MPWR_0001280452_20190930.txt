Certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted in accordance with these accounting principles, rules and regulations.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires entities to recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheets for leases with terms greater than 12 months.
The Company adopted the standard on  January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method and did not restate comparative periods, as permitted by the standard.
In addition, the Company elected the transition practical expedients to not reassess its contracts that existed prior to  January 1, 2019.
The adoption did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations or the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment.
The guidance removes step two of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation.
A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary.
2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), which introduces a model based on expected losses to estimate credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments.
Entities will apply the standard by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.
The Company generates revenue primarily from product sales, which include assembled and tested integrated circuits, as well as dies in wafer form.
The remaining revenue primarily includes royalty revenue from licensing arrangements and revenue from wafer testing services performed for third parties, which have not been significant in all periods presented.
See Note 8 for the disaggregation of the Company’s revenue by geographic regions and by product families.

We defend ourselves vigorously against any such claims.
You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC in evaluating our business.
The future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors.
•   changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets.
In recent years, global credit and financial markets experienced disruptions, and may experience disruptions in the future, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability.
Volatility in the credit markets could severely diminish liquidity and capital availability.
We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic disruption or subsequent economic recovery worldwide, in the United States, in our industry, or in the different markets that we serve.
Recent changes in international trade policy and rising concern of international tariffs, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the United States and China, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Since the beginning of 2018, there has been increasing rhetoric, in some cases coupled with legislative or executive action, from several U.S. and foreign leaders regarding tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials.
More specifically, there have been several rounds of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods taking effect in 2018 and 2019, some of which prompted retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods.
