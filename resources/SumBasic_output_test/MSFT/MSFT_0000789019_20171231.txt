On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA.We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world.
We develop, license, and support a wide range of software products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people’s lives.
Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency.
They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins.
We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services.
A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and wearables.
Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform.
