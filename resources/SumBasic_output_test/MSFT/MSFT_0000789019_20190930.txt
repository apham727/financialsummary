Refer to Note 15 – Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for further information.
Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.
The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation fiscal year 2019 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 1, 2019.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values.
Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method.
Debt investments are impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary.
Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management.
We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments.
Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method, or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative).
Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings.

We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms.
Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces.
Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers.
In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.
To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value.
Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.
Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising.
These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software.
Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks.
