Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources.
A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and wearables.
Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform.
We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers.
Users sometimes incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms.
To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our marketplace and ensure that these applications have high quality, customer appeal, and value.
Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.
