Beginning in January 2018, CTS adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" under the modified retrospective method, which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.
This approach was applied to contracts not completed as of December 31, 2017.
At date of adoption, there was no significant change to our past revenue recognition practices and therefore no adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings was required.
We usually expect payment within 30 to 90 days from the shipping date, depending on our terms with the customer.
None of our contracts as of June 30, 2018, contained a significant financing component.
Contract assets will be reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable.
The increase in contract liabilities as of June 30, 2018 is primarily due to net increases in estimated future discounts and price concessions, offset by net settlements of products sold with rights of return.
(1) Expected return on plan assets is net of expected investment expenses and certain administrative expenses.
In June 2016, we announced plans to restructure operations by phasing out production at our Elkhart facility by the end of 2018 and transitioning it into a research and development center supporting our global operations ("June 2016 Plan").
Additional organizational changes were also implemented in various other locations.
The amendment added an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which will be consolidated into a single facility.
The total cost of the plan is expected to be approximately $13,400.
These restructuring actions were completed in 2015.
Certain processes in the manufacture of our current and past products create by-products classified as hazardous waste.

Other expense in the first six months of 2018 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro during the first half of the year.

Working capital decreased by $4,283 during the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due the decrease in cash and cash equivalents as well as the increase in accounts payable, which were partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory.
Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $18,757, depreciation and amortization expense of $10,961, other net non-cash items of $1,677, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $3,674.
Net cash used in investing activities for the first six months of 2018 was $14,909, driven almost entirely by capital expenditures relating to our ongoing ERP project and production line movements.
These cash outflows were the result of net long-term debt payments of $19,300, dividend payments of $2,638, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants in the amount of $1,429.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires, among other things, that CTS comply with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.
