Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)".
This guidance requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
Beginning in January 2018, CTS adopted the provisions of Topic 606 under the modified retrospective method, which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the date of adoption.
At date of adoption, there was no significant change to our past revenue recognition practices and therefore no adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings was required.
We usually expect payment within 30 to 90 days from the shipping date, depending on our terms with the customer.
Contract assets will be reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable.
The increase in contract liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily due to net increases in estimated future discounts and price concessions, offset by net settlements of products sold with rights of return.
In June 2016, we announced plans to restructure operations by phasing out production at our Elkhart facility by the end of 2018 and transitioning it into a research and development center supporting our global operations ("June 2016 Plan").
Additional organizational changes will also occur in various other locations.
During the third quarter of 2017, we revised the June 2016 Plan.
The amendment added an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which will be consolidated into a single facility.
The amendment does not impact any additional employees.
These restructuring actions, which were completed during 2015, impacted approximately 120 positions.
We reserve for probable remediation activities and for claims and proceedings against us with respect to other environmental matters.
On May 23, 2016, we requested and received a $100,000 increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments under the existing credit agreement, which increased the credit line from $200,000 to $300,000.

Sales were $113,530 in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $13,376 or 13.4% from the first quarter of 2017.
Other sales increased $5,464 or 16.2%.
Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by $2,751 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar depreciating compared to the Euro and Chinese Renminbi and relating mostly to sales of automotive products.
The charges were mainly for building and equipment relocation, severance, and travel costs related to the restructuring of certain operations as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan.
Our effective income tax rate was 24.5% and 30.6% in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Total long-term debt was $74,000 as of March 31, 2018 and $76,300 as of December 31, 2017.
Working capital increased by $8,880 during the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents and inventory as well as a decrease in accrued payroll and benefits, which were partially offset by higher accounts payable.
Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $11,548, depreciation and amortization expense of $5,483, other net non-cash items of $2,264, and the net cash inflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $859.
These cash outflows were the result of net long-term debt payments of $2,300, taxes paid on behalf of employees for equity awards in the amount of $1,423, and dividend payments of $1,318.
Failure to comply with these covenants could reduce the borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility.
In the third quarter of 2016, we entered into three additional forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $50,000 of long-term debt for the periods August 2017 to August 2020.
We have historically funded our capital and operating needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities, supported by available credit under our Revolving Credit Facility.
