invoiced, collected from, or paid to our customers are recognized as contract assets or liabilities.
Contract assets will be reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable.
The increase in contract liabilities as of September 30, 2018 is primarily due to net increases in estimated future discounts and price concessions, offset by net settlements of products sold with rights of return.

In June 2016, we announced plans to restructure operations by phasing out production at our Elkhart facility by the end of 2018 and transitioning it into a research and development center supporting our global operations ("June 2016 Plan").
Additional organizational changes were also implemented in various other locations.
During the third quarter of 2017, we revised the June 2016 Plan.
The amendment added an additional $1,100 in planned costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in Lisle, IL and our plant in Bolingbrook, IL, both of which will be consolidated into a single facility.
These restructuring actions were completed in 2015.
Certain processes in the manufacture of our current and past products create by-products classified as hazardous waste.
Some sites, such as Asheville, North Carolina and Mountain View, California, are designated National Priorities List sites under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund program.
We reserve for probable remediation activities and for claims and proceedings against us with respect to other environmental matters.
