Accordingly, certain information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements are not included herein.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these interim statements have been recorded and are of a normal and recurring nature.
The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019 (as amended on September 20, 2019, the “2018 Form 10-K”).
Our more significant estimates include the excess and obsolete inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination of the deferred and accrued revenue components of multiple performance obligations sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred and accrued revenue, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments.
Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.
When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related disposals are charged against the inventory reserves.
See Note 8 for additional information.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company determined that there was an immaterial misstatement of its excess and obsolete inventory reserves in its previously issued annual and interim financial statements.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the out-of-period adjustment was a cumulative $0.2 million reduction in the Company’s excess and obsolete inventory reserves and cost of goods sold.
In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842) Codification Improvements, which removed the requirement for an entity to disclose in the interim periods after adoption, the effect of the change on income from continuing operations, net income, any other affected financial statement line item, and any affected per share amount.See also Item 1A, Risk Factors, of the 2018 Form 10‑K.
Many of our customers require prompt delivery of products.
This requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, our current expectations include a continued impact from a decline in sales related to these two customers.
For the international Tier 1 customer, we believe that normal spending should resume in 2020.We maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions.Even disclosure controls and procedures determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance that their objectives are achieved.We have identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could, if not remediated, materially adversely affect us.
