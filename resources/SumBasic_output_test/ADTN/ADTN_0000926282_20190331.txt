Our more significant estimates include the obsolete and excess inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, determination of the deferred and accrued revenue components of multiple element sales agreements, estimated costs to complete obligations associated with deferred and accrued revenue, estimated income tax provision and income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, valuation and estimated lives of intangible assets, estimated pension liability, fair value of investments and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which changes the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement.
The amendments in this ASU are the result of a broader disclosure project called, Concepts Statement No.
8 - Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting — Chapter 8, Notes to Financial Statements, which the FASB finalized on August 28, 2018.
In addition, ASU 2018-13 requires disclosures regarding the uncertainty in the fair value measurements as of the reporting date and how changes in fair value measurements affect performance and cash flows.
Specifically, ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementations costs incurred to develop or obtain internal use software.
In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 824) Codification Improvements, which removed the requirement for an entity to disclose in the interim periods after adoption, the effect of the change on income from continuing operations, net income, any other affected financial statement line item, and any affected per share amount.
For lessors, the new leasing standard requires leases to be classified as a sales-type, direct financing or operating leases.
These criteria focus on the transfer of control of the underlying lease asset.
This standard and related updates were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients which allows for companies to not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, not reassess historical lease classifications for expired or existing contracts and not reassess initial direct costs for existing leases.
Additionally, the Company elected the practical expedients which allow the use of hindsight when determining the lease term, the short-term lease recognition exemption and the option to not separate lease and non-lease components.
As a lessor, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Income or Statement of Cash Flow.
Contingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date, the payments of which are dependent upon SmartRG achieving future revenue, EBIT or customer purchase order milestones during the first half of 2019.
The contingent payments are subject to arbitration and the final payouts, if applicable, are expected to occur during the third quarter of 2019.
An escrow in the amount of $2.8 million was set up at the acquisition date, to fund post-closing working capital settlements and to indemnify the Company from any inaccuracy or breach of representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the sellers.
The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents the financial results of the Company as if the acquisition of SmartRG and Sumitomo had occurred on January 1, 2018.
Aside from revising the 2018 net income for the effect of the bargain purchase gain, there were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information.
