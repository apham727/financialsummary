Consequently, we have not necessarily included all information and footnotes required for audited financial statements.
In our opinion, the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, except as otherwise indicated) necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2017.
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FICO and its subsidiaries.
For example, we use estimates in determining the collectability of accounts receivable; the appropriate levels of various accruals; labor hours in connection with fixed-fee service contracts; the amount of our tax provision and the realizability of deferred tax assets.
Actual results may differ from our estimates.

We use analytics to help businesses automate, improve and connect decisions across their enterprise, an approach we commonly refer to as decision management.
Our predictive analytics, which includes the industry-standard FICO® Score, and our decision management systems leverage the use of big data and mathematical algorithms to predict consumer behavior and power hundreds of billions of customer decisions each year.
We also serve consumers through online services that enable people to purchase and understand their FICO® Scores, the standard measure of consumer credit risk in the U.S., and empower them to manage their financial health.
Most of our solutions address customer engagement, including customer acquisition, customer onboarding, customer servicing and management, and customer protection.
Our solutions enable users to make decisions that are more precise, consistent and agile, and that systematically advance business goals.
A significant portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of products and services within the banking (including consumer credit) industry, and 87% and 74% of our revenues were derived from within this industry during the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 85% and 74% of our revenues were derived from within this industry during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Our DM strategy is also increasingly focused on the delivery of our products through cloud-based deployments.
The market may be unreceptive to our general DM business approach, including being unreceptive to purchasing multiple products from us, unreceptive to our customized solutions, or unreceptive to our cloud-based offerings.
Our growth and the success of our DM strategy depend upon our ability to develop and sell new products or suites of products, including the development and sale of our cloud-based product offerings.
In the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new products and product enhancements, primarily due to difficulties developing models, acquiring data, and adapting to particular operating environments or certain client or other systems.
We have also experienced errors or “bugs” in our software products, despite testing prior to release of the products.
