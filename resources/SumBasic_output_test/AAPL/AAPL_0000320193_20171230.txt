The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation.
These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 (the “2017 Form 10-K”).
The first quarter of 2018 spanned 13 weeks, whereas a 14th week was added to the first fiscal quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.
Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Potentially dilutive securities include unvested restricted stock units (“RSUs”), unvested restricted stock, outstanding stock options and shares to be purchased by employees under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan.
Potentially dilutive securities whose effect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.
The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management.
The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature.
The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.
However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.
To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies.
The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges.

The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business.
In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.
These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-Q.
The Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macOS, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market.
This market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows.
In the market for personal computers and accessories, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed customer base.
Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors.
An increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company’s existing products.
