On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606), which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
Deferred contract costs had been minimal under our prior practices as most costs to obtain a contract and fulfill a contract were expensed as incurred.
Certain document management services arrangements may also include an embedded lease of equipment.
In these instances, the revenues associated with the lease are recognized in accordance with the requirements for lease accounting.
There is no significant after-market for our used equipment.
This amount is expected to be amortized over its estimated period of benefit, which we currently estimate to be approximately four years.
This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019 and certain practical expedients can be elected upon adoption.
On the Lessee side, a cross-functional implementation team has been established which is evaluating the lease portfolio, system, process and policy change requirements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets.
The update impacts financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through Net income.

To better understand the trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S.
This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency.
Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends.
Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
These incremental adjustments primarily relate to Fuji Xerox’s Asia Pacific subsidiaries and involve improper revenue recognition, including revenue associated with leasing transactions, additional provisions for bad debt allowances and other asset impairments.
Fuji Xerox is committed to implementing additional measures to remediate these newly identified issues.
•Services, maintenance and rentals revenue includes rental and maintenance revenue (including bundled supplies) as well as the post sale component of the document services revenue from our Managed Document Services (MDS) offerings, and revenues from our Communication and Marketing Solutions (CMS).
Both periods were impacted by price declines of approximately 5% (which were in-line with our historic declines).
These declines were only partially mitigated by demand for the recently launched Iridesse production press.
•8% decrease in color multifunction devices, reflecting lower sales through our U.S. channels.
