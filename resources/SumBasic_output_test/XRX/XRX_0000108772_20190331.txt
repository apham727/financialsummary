The purpose of the Reorganization is to provide the Company with strategic, operational and financial flexibility.
In March 2019, as part of Project Own It, we entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we are outsourcing certain global administrative and support functions, including, among others, selected information technology and finance functions (excluding accounting).
This update aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license).
On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC Topic 842).
Short term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not required to be recognized.
The accounting for lessors does not fundamentally change with this update except for changes to conform and align guidance to the lessee guidance, as well as to the revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09.
Upon adoption we applied the transition option, whereby prior comparative periods are not retrospectively presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
Our leases generally do not provide a residual guarantee.
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components.
There is no significant after-market for our used equipment.

These benefits were partially offset by higher Restructuring and related costs.
The decline in installs was partially offset by a favorable revenue mix driven by strong demand for the higher-configuration models of our Iridesse production press.
Installs reflect new placement of devices only.
Revenue associated with equipment installations (discussed below) may be reflected up-front in Equipment sales or over time either through rental income or as part of our Xerox Services revenues (which are both reported within our post sale revenues), depending on the terms and conditions of our agreements with customers.
