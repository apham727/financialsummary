Certain prior year amounts have been conformed to the current year presentation.
On March 6, 2019, the Xerox Board of Directors approved a reorganization (the “Reorganization”) of the Company's corporate structure into a holding company structure.
The Reorganization was subject to the approval of shareholders, which was obtained at the annual shareholders meeting held May 21, 2019.
On July 31, 2019, Xerox completed the Reorganization, pursuant to which Xerox became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox Holdings Corporation ("Xerox Holdings").
Accordingly, we reclassified approximately $221 from Xerox’s Common stock to Additional paid-in capital.
The transition of these functions to HCL is expected to take up to 18 months.

The accounting for lessors does not fundamentally change with this update except for changes to conform and align guidance to the lessee guidance, as well as to the revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09.
Our leases generally do not provide a residual guarantee.

We refer to this analysis as "constant currency", “currency impact” or “the impact from currency.” This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate.
Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends.
Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
In addition, lower revenues were offset by the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements from our Project Own It transformation actions.
These benefits were partially offset by higher Restructuring and related costs.
