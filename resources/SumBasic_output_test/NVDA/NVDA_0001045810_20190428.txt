We recognized an income tax benefit of $5 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and income tax expense of $67 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
We review fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis.
The following table shows the changes in deferred revenue during the first quarter of fiscal years 2020 and 2019.
The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of April 28, 2019 and January 27, 2019.
These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.
Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.
As of April 28, 2019, we had not borrowed any amounts under this agreement.
