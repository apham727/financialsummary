Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies, in all industries.
We adopted this guidance on January 29, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach.
Refer to Note 2 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
We are now required to recognize changes in the fair value of our equity investments through net income rather than other comprehensive income.
We expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Comparative information for prior periods has not been adjusted.
The impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019 was not significant.
Revenue related to remaining performance obligations represents the amount of contracted license and development arrangements and PCS that has not been recognized.
The Convertible Notes have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the reporting period exceeds the adjusted conversion price of $20.02 per share.
Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as “available-for-sale” debt securities.
We review fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis.
Future amortization expense related to the net carrying amount of intangible assets as of July 29, 2018 is estimated to be $12 million for the remainder of fiscal year 2019, $20 million in fiscal year 2020, $11 million in fiscal year 2021, $4 million in fiscal year 2022, $3 million in fiscal year 2023, and $1 million in fiscal 2024.
As of July 29, 2018, we had outstanding inventory purchase obligations totaling $1.91 billion.
As of July 29, 2018, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months.

All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries, except where it is made clear that the term means only the parent company.
We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI.
Gaming revenue was $1.80 billion, up 52% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $7.94 billion as of July 29, 2018, compared with $7.30 billion at the end of the prior quarter.
The sequential increase was primarily related to second quarter operating income, partially offset by changes in working capital.
We also announced a number of Max-Q GeForce gaming notebook designs offered by major OEMs, enabling high-end performance for thin and light notebooks; disclosed that next-generation NVIDIA G-SYNC HDR displays are being shipped, enabling stutter-free gaming; and announced NVIDIA’s role in VirtualLink, a consortium establishing an industry standard to enable next-gen VR headsets to connect with PCs using a single, high-bandwidth USB Type-C connector.
In August 2018, we unveiled our first Turing-based GPUs -- NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000, RTX 6000 and RTX 5000 -- which we believe will revolutionize the work of millions of designers and artists; and introduced the NVIDIA RTX Server, a ray-tracing global illumination rendering server for render farms.
This increase was due primarily to 50% growth in sales of GeForce GPU products for gaming, driven by Pascal-based GPUs for desktops and by high-performance notebooks based on our Max-Q technology.
Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 20% due primarily to higher sales across desktop and mobile workstation products.
Our PC OEM revenue decreased by almost 60% driven by lower demand for GPU products targeted for use in cryptocurrency mining.
Datacenter revenue, including Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased 77%, reflecting strong sales of our Volta architecture, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems.
This was driven by an increase of over 75% in revenue from SOC modules for gaming platforms and development services, and an increase of 13% in automotive revenue, primarily from DRIVE PX platforms and development agreements with automotive companies, as well as from infotainment modules.
