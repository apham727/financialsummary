In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date for all entities by one year.
Companies have the option of using either a full or modified retrospective approach in applying this standard.
The adoption did not result in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings, nor did it have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

The Company recognizes services revenue when the repair, installation or training is performed.
The services we provide are relatively short in duration and typically completed in one to two weeks.
Therefore, at each reporting date, the amount of unbilled work performed is insignificant.
The services revenue has consistently accounted for less than 5% of the Company’s total revenues and is expected to continue at that level.
