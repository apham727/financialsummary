The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
Our fiscal quarter ends on the Saturday nearest the end of the quarter-ending month.
The first nine months of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 contained 40 and 39 weeks, respectively.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of interim periods have been made.
All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.
The unaudited consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries.
Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
The financial information contained in this report should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2017, that we filed on July 31, 2017.
Inventory reserves were approximately $3.7 million as of March 3, 2018 and $3.5 million as of May 27, 2017.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2014-09 (“ASU 2014-09”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends guidance for revenue recognition.
ASU 2014-09 is principles based guidance that can be applied to all contracts with customers, enhancing comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets.
The core principle of the guidance is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date for all entities by one year.
Companies have the option of using either a full or modified retrospective approach in applying this standard.
During fiscal 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued four additional updates which further clarify the guidance provided in ASU 2014-09.
We are evaluating the impact of the new standard on our financial statements using a three-phase approach (assessment, conversion and implementation).
We have undertaken a detailed analysis of our various contracts with customers and revenue streams.
The Company has engaged a third party to assist in evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
We will complete the conversion and implementation phases by the end of fiscal year 2018 in conjunction with future interpretative guidance.
During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date.
If after reviewing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then we test for impairment through the application of a fair value based test.
Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives either on a straight-line basis or over their projected future cash flows and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment.
The carrying value of goodwill was $6.3 million as of March 3, 2018 and May 27, 2017.
