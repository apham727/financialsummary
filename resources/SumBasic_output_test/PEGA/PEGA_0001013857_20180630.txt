2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model for credit losses.Pegasystems Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company) has prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding interim financial reporting.
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No.
2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, including accounts receivable, upon initial recognition of that financial asset using a forward-looking expected loss model, rather than an incurred loss model for credit losses.
Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset, removing the concept of other-than-temporary impairments.
The effective date for the Company will be January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets, recognizing a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
Any unrecognized license revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period that control transfers or as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of December 31, 2015.
Unbilled receivables in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets increased significantly upon adoption due to the revenue from term licenses being recognized prior to amounts billed, or prepaid by, clients and perpetual licenses with extended payment terms.
This change primarily impacts the Companys contracts related to multi-year cloud offerings, maintenance on term and perpetual licenses, and those long-term term and perpetual licenses with client usage rights that increase over time.
