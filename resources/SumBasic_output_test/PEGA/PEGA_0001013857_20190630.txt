Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company’s historic accounting under ASC 840 “Leases”.
See Note 9.
Unbilled receivables are client committed amounts for which revenue recognition precedes billing, and billing is solely subject to the passage of time.
Contract assets and deferred revenue are netted at the contract level for each reporting period.
The Company expects to benefit from those costs for more than one year, as the Company generally only pays sales commissions on the initial contract, and not any subsequent contract renewals.
As a result, there are no commensurate commissions paid on contract renewals.
The Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, and investments in privately-held companies at fair value on a recurring basis.
There were no transfers between levels during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
For certain other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying value approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these items.

•“Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Judgments” in Item 7.
Our license revenue is derived from sales of our applications and Pega Platform.
The decreases are also attributable to revenue recognized from term license contracts in the six months ended June 30, 2019 with multi-year committed maintenance periods, which resulted in a greater portion of the contract value being allocated to maintenance.
The increases in maintenance revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were primarily due to the continued growth in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software and strong renewal rates in excess of 90%.
The increase in total gross profit percent in the three months ended June 30, 2019 was driven by an increase in higher margin maintenance revenue.
The decrease in consulting gross profit percent in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was driven by a decrease in billable hours as consulting resources were transitioning to new projects after completing a large project and an increase in consulting resource availability as we continue growing and leveraging our partner network.
The increases in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of $4.6 million and $6.7 million, attributable to an increase in headcount and equity compensation, and increases of $1.7 million and $3.3 million in cloud hosting expenses as we expand our cloud-focused research and development activities.
