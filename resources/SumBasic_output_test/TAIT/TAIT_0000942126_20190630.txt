We maintain a majority-owned subsidiary in Mexico (since 1998) and two divisions in each of Taiwan (since 1997) and China (since 2005).
Our China location also serves as the engineering design support center responsible for arranging pre-production scheduling and mass production runs with joint venture partners for our projects, making component datasheets and test specifications, preparing samples, monitoring quality of shipments and performing failure analysis reports.
Operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of financial results for the full year.

We are primarily focused on supplying ODM products for our OEM customer’s multi-year turn-key projects.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our June 30, 2019, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 45% of current assets and 32% of total assets.
The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of ODM project sales volume.Controls and Procedures.Item 1.
