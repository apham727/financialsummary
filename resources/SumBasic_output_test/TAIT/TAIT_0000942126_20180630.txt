In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new accounting standard on leasing.
We expect the adoption of these accounting changes will not impact our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets.
This guidance will be effective for the year ending December 31, 2019 and interim reporting periods within that year.
Early adoption is permitted.

The increase was driven by an increase of ODM project sales volume.
Other income, net of other expense, in the second quarter of 2018 was $29,000 versus $31,000 in the comparable period for 2017.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 versus Six Months Ended June 30, 2017.
The decrease was driven by a decrease in demand for ODM components.
We have financed our operations with funds generated from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
Inventory is included in current assets; however, it will take over one year for the inventory to turn.
Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash.
If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of short-term commercial loans, asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities.
