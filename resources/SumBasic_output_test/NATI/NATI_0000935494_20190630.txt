In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the results of our operations and comprehensive income for three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 and the statement of stockholder's equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement.
We adopted the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 and used the effective date as our date of initial adoption.
Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for earlier periods.
Additionally, we also reclassified approximately $19 million from "Property, plant and equipment, net" to "Operating lease right-of-use assets" related to prepaid leasehold land.
We elected the 'package of practical expedients', which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.
This means, for those leases that qualify, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition.
We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for our office leases.
