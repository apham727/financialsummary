In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the results of our operations and comprehensive income for three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 and the statement of stockholder's equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
During the three months ended September 30, 2019, we recognized a gain of $26.8 million from the sale of our 136,000 square foot office building and property located at 6504 Bridgepoint Parkway, Austin, Texas (the "Millennium Property").
Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement.
Additionally, we also reclassified approximately $19 million from "Property, plant and equipment, net" to "Operating lease right-of-use assets" related to prepaid leasehold land.
We elected the "package of practical expedients", which permits us not to reassess under the new lease standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.
We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.
In August 2018, the SEC issued Release No.
33-10532 that amends and clarifies certain financial reporting requirements.
We adopted this new rule beginning with our financial reporting for the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
The ASU will replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
Entities are also required to record allowances for available-for-sale debt securities rather than reduce the carrying amount.
We do not plan to adopt the ASU earlier than our required effective date of January 1, 2020.
The impact of this new guidance on our accounting policies and financial statements is described below.
Additionally, in the first quarter of 2019, we granted performance-based restricted stock units to certain executives under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("PRSUs").
