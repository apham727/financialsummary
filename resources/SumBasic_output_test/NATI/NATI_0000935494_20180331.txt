Accounts receivable are recorded net of allowances for doubtful accounts.
We analyze historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts.
Unbilled receivables represent amounts for which revenue has been recognized but which have not yet been invoiced to the customer.
Under this method, we evaluated all contracts that were in effect at the beginning of 2018 as if those contracts had been accounted for under the new revenue standard.
We did not evaluate individual modifications for those periods prior to the adoption date, but the aggregate effect of all modifications as of the adoption date and such effects are provided below.
A cumulative catch-up adjustment was recorded to beginning retained earnings to reflect the impact of all existing arrangements under the new revenue standard.
Under the new revenue standard, we are no longer required to establish vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") to recognize software license revenue separately from the other elements, and we are able to recognize all software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license, which will generally occur at the start of each license term.
Our historical net cash flows are not impacted by this accounting change.
The guidance requires lessees to recognize most lease liabilities on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice.
We do not expect to adopt the new standard prior to the required effective date.
Product revenues are primarily generated from the sale of off-the-shelf modular test and measurement hardware components and related drivers, and application software licenses.
Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software.
We also offer some term-based software licenses that expire, which are referred to as subscription arrangements.
Revenues from offerings related to our hardware and software products such as extended hardware warranties, training, consulting and installation services are not significant and also presented within product revenues, as further discussed below.
Software maintenance revenues consists of post contract customer support that provides the customer with unspecified upgrades and technical support.
We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including perpetual and term licenses sold with software maintenance.

We are not currently a party to any material litigation.
However, in the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in a limited number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.
In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below.
The risks described below are not the only risks that we face.
Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk to us as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, geopolitical instability, declines in income or asset values, or other factors.
In March 2018, the U.S. announced steel and aluminum tariffs on imports from China.
