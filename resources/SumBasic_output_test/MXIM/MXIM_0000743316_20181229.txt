In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).

Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with historic accounting standards under Topic 605.
Under Topic 605, the gross amount of accrued revenue reserves for price adjustments and other revenue reserves of $141.7 million was included within accounts receivable, net as of June 30, 2018.
