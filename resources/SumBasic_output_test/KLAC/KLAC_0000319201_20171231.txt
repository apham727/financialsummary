Basis of Presentation.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for the periods indicated.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The reclassifications had no effect on the prior year’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Cash Flows.
Management Estimates.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
•When the customer fab has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when the Company can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria.
•When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% of the payment is due based upon shipment.
•When the customer withholds acceptance due to issues unrelated to product performance, in which case revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets predetermined specifications.
The Company has multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period.
For substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to products and services, the Company uses vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) or third-party evidence (“TPE”) to allocate the selling price to each deliverable.
The Company determines TPE based on historical prices charged for products and services when sold on a stand-alone basis.
When the Company is unable to establish relative selling price using VSOE or TPE, the Company uses estimated selling price (“ESP”) in its allocation of arrangement consideration.
The Company regularly reviews relative selling prices and maintains internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates.

Ongoing changes in the technology industry, as well as the semiconductor industry in particular, could expose our business to significant risks.
The semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time.
•The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, which exposes our business and operating results to increased volatility tied to individual customers.
•As a result of this consolidation, the customers that survive the consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales and, consequently, have greater commercial negotiating leverage.
Any of these changes could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenues and gross margins.
•Certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes, created alliances with other companies, experienced management changes or have outsourced manufacturing activities, any of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions.
•The highly concentrated business environment also increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each of our customers.
To the extent our customers experience liquidity issues in the future, we may be required to incur additional bad debt expense with respect to receivables owed to us by those customers.
