Management Estimates.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
We updated our accounting policies for Leases.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to measure ROU assets and lease liabilities.This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Forward-looking statements also include the assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing statements.The industries that we serve, including the semiconductor, flat panel display and printed circuit board industries, are constantly developing and changing over time.
•The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, which exposes our business and operating results to increased volatility tied to individual customers.
•As a result of this consolidation, the customers that survive the consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales and, consequently, have greater commercial negotiating leverage.
Any of these changes could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenues and gross margins.
•The highly concentrated business environment also increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each of our customers.
