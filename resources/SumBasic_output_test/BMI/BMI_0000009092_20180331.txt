The consolidated condensed balance sheet at December 31, 2017 was derived from amounts included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The details in those notes have not changed except as discussed below and as a result of normal adjustments in the interim.
The Company additionally has a postretirement healthcare benefit plan that provides medical benefits for certain U.S. retirees and eligible dependents hired prior to November 1, 2004.

The Company believes that no additional contributions will be required during 2018.
The Company also disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 that it estimated it would pay $0.4 million in other postretirement benefits in 2018 based on actuarial estimates.
As of March 31, 2018, $71,500 of such benefits have been paid.
The preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired was based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
The purchase price was approximately $23.2 million in cash, plus a small working capital adjustment.
The purchase price included $5.4 million in payments that are anticipated to be made in 2018 which are recorded in payables and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2018.Municipal water, the largest category by sales volume, includes mechanical and ultrasonic (electronic) water meters and related technologies and services used by municipal water utilities as the basis for generating water and wastewater revenues.
Meters equipped with radio technology (endpoints) receive flow measurement data from encoder registers attached to the water meter, which is encrypted and transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility billing systems.
AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to drive through service territories to collect data from the meters.
ORION Cellular eliminates the need for utility-owned fixed network infrastructure, allows for rapid deployment and decreases ongoing maintenance.
The Company’s BEACON AMA Managed Solution is the latest in metering technology.
The BEACON AMA secure, cloud-hosted software suite includes a customizable dashboard, the ability to establish alerts for specific conditions, and consumer engagement tools that allow end water customers to view and manage their water usage activity.
Benefits to the utility include improved customer service, increased visibility through faster leak detection, the ability to promote and quantify the effects of its water conservation efforts, and easier compliance reporting.
Over the last decade, there has been a growing trend in the conversion from manually read water meters to radio technology.
