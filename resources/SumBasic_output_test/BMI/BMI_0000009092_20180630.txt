The shareholder rights plan that was in effect since February 15, 2008 expired on May 26, 2018 and the Board of Directors decided not to renew the plan.
The Company has taken steps towards terminating the pension plan and expects the termination to be finalized in the third quarter of 2018.
The ultimate settlement obligation will depend upon the nature and timing of participant settlements at prevailing market conditions.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, in connection with the Company's ongoing activities to terminate the plan, lump-sum distributions to participants of the Plan exceeded the service and interest components of net periodic pension cost.
The Company additionally has a postretirement healthcare benefit plan that provides medical benefits for certain U.S. retirees and eligible dependents hired prior to November 1, 2004.
Employees are eligible to receive postretirement healthcare benefits upon meeting certain age and service requirements.
This plan requires employee contributions to offset benefit costs.
The Company believes that no additional contributions will be required during 2018 as it will be terminated prior to the end of 2018.
As of June 30, 2018, $142,000 of such benefits have been paid.
The Company continues to believe that its estimated payments for the full year are reasonable.Municipal water, the largest category by sales volume, includes mechanical and ultrasonic (electronic) water meters and related technologies and services used by municipal water utilities as the basis for generating water and wastewater revenues.
Meters equipped with radio technology (endpoints) receive flow measurement data from encoder registers attached to the water meter, which is encrypted and transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility billing systems.
AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to drive through service territories to collect data from the meters.
ORION Migratable makes the migration to fixed network easier for utilities that prefer to start with mobile reading and later adopt fixed network communications, allowing utilities to choose a solution for their current needs and be positioned for their future operational changes.
ORION Cellular eliminates the need for utility-owned fixed network infrastructure, allows for rapid deployment and decreases ongoing maintenance.
The Companyâ€™s BEACON AMA Managed Solution is the latest in metering technology.
The BEACON AMA secure, cloud-hosted software suite includes a customizable dashboard, the ability to establish alerts for specific conditions, and consumer engagement tools that allow end water customers to view and manage their water usage activity.
Benefits to the utility include improved customer service, increased visibility through faster leak detection, the ability to promote and quantify the effects of its water conservation efforts, and easier compliance reporting.
Over the last decade, there has been a growing trend in the conversion from manually read water meters to radio technology.
