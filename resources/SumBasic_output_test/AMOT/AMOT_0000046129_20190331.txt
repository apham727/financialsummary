We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Czech Republic, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Czech Krona, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively.
We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter ended March 31, 2019 decreased sales in comparison to quarter ended March 31, 2018 by approximately $3,100.
The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,700 on our foreign net assets as of March 31, 2019.
We use interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.
In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022.
