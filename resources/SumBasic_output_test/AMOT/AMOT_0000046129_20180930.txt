Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward- looking statements as a prediction of actual results.
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made.
Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange (FX) of $(744), third quarter revenue was $80,836, up 24%.
We remain focused on executing our strategy for growth while streamlining the organization and emphasizing continuous improvement in quality, delivery, cost and innovation as we drive the One Allied approach and expand our value proposition for our customers.
Also, we continue to build a pipeline of exciting market-based application opportunities.
Sales cycles are long and the time from being selected for the solution development to full rate production can be longer, yet we believe we are building a scalable foundation which can deliver strong returns on those investments.
Sales to U.S. customers were 53% of total sales for 2018 compared with 54% for the same period last year, with the balance of sales to customers primarily in Europe, Canada and Asia.
Sales volume increased by 24% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and there was a 3% favorable currency impact.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for information purposes only and are not measures of financial performance under GAAP.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Capital expenditures are expected to increase for the remainder of 2018 to support our new contract wins along with our continued IT infrastructure enhancements.
The Company expects to invest between $13 million and $16 million in capital expenditures during 2018.
The change in cash used in financing activities reflects the 2018 use of the revolver to partially finance the acquisition of the Maval OE Steering business.
The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to minimum interest coverage and total leverage ratio at the end of each quarter.

We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Czech Republic, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Czech Krona, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased sales by approximately $5,500 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income.
The translation adjustment was a loss of approximately $300 and a gain of approximately $1,800 for the third quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 1.50%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 0.50%), in each case depending on the Companys ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA.
We use interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (principal accounting officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of September 30, 2018.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
