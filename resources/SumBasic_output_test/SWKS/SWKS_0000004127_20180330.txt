We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

•Net revenue increased by 11% to $1,965 million for the six months ended March 30, 2018, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017.
This increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of cash generated from operations of $795 million, partially offset by the repurchase of 2.7 million shares of common stock for $284 million, dividend payments of $118 million, and capital expenditures of $119 million during the six months ended March 30, 2018.
These positive impacts were partially offset by lower average selling prices with a gross profit impact of $79.8 million.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 30, 2018, increased as a percentage of net revenue due to the aforementioned increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.
We do not anticipate any further significant charges associated with these restructuring activities.
We recorded a provision for income taxes of $16.3 million (which consisted of $7.8 million and $8.5 million related to United States and foreign income taxes, respectively) and $331.5 million (which consisted of $312.7 million and $18.8 million related to United States and foreign income taxes, respectively) for the three and six months ended March 30, 2018, respectively.
If we are unable to obtain sufficient cash or capital to meet our needs on a timely basis and on favorable terms, our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected.
