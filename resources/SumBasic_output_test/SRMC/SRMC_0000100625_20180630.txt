In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606).
The majority of the impact has been on sales returns and the impact has been deemed immaterial.
The Company’s revenues are derived from the sale of FieldServer products, FieldServer products services, Gas Detection and Environment Control products, and Gas Detection and Environment Control products services.This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
As of the second quarter of 2018, sales of FieldServer products increased by 8% compared to the same period in 2017.
Box products provide a platform for delivery and operation of our software for building automation projects and are generally sold to integrators.
OEM modules are sold to companies that integrate our products into their commercial offerings.
For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, selling and marketing expenses were approximately $2,730,000, or 26% of net sales, and approximately $2,616,000, or 28% of net sales, respectively.
Selling expenses have increased in the three and six-month periods ending June 30, 2018 primarily because we added a Regional Sales Manager for Asia and Canada as well as a Regional Sales Manager for Latin America.
Our general and administrative expenses have acclimated to a higher run-rate in 2018 primarily due to technology upgrades to key customer and delivery focused systems.
The increase in income in both the second quarter and first half of 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 is due primarily to the non-recurring expense for separation packages for our two former senior executives.
As summarized below, the cash provided during the six months ended June 30, 2017 was due primarily to cash received by a potential strategic partner offset by changes in income.
Of the total cash received, $500,000 was an expense reimbursement for some of the out-of-pocket costs the Company had incurred in connection with its consideration of strategic alternatives.
