The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared by Sierra Monitor Corporation (the “Company,” “we,” or “us”) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
The Company’s FieldServer family of protocol gateways, routers, and network explorers targets facility automation requirements, and is used by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and system integrators to enable local and remote monitoring and control of assets and facilities.
The FieldServer family of products works with the FieldPoP™ device cloud portal; a cloud-based service that registers and manages FieldServer products, provides secure remote access to the local web-based applications that run on FieldServer products, and integrates with third-party applications over REST APIs.
In addition to bridging data protocols between various assets or devices within a facility, the embedded software includes value-added “fog” or “local application” software for monitoring, logging, alarming, and trending local field data.
The Company’s solutions are also sold to telecommunication companies and their suppliers to manage environmental and security conditions such as temperature, gas, and smoke in remote structures such as local DSL distribution nodes and buildings at cell tower sites.
ASC 606 provides for a five-step model that includes identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when, or as, an entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The discussion is incorporated herein by reference.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, issued as a new Topic, ASC Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09).
The premise of the standard is that a Company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company has adopted the guidance beginning in fiscal 2018 and had previously disclosed that it would use the full retrospective approach.
However, the Company has changed its implementation to the modified retrospective approach.

This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
Our flame and gas detection products are generally sold to engineering and installation firms who utilize the products as part of larger fire and safety projects in a variety of facilities, such as oil, gas and chemical processing plants, wastewater treatment facilities, alternate fuel vehicle maintenance garages, and other sites where hazardous gases are used or produced.
Our FieldServer products are primarily sold to OEMs who develop a broad range of products relevant to facility automation, such as boilers, chillers, air handlers, lighting controls, generator sets, electric sub-meters, etc.
Our FieldServer products are also bought by system integrators looking to connect various discrete automation sub-systems to a common facility management system.
Our IIoT focused products are showing growth due to pull through from other solutions like our SMC Cloud offer which is enabling device management, visualization and analytics.
Expenses for research and development, which include new product development and engineering to sustain existing products, were $774,428, or 15.0% of net sales, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, compared with $760,296, or 16.8% of net sales, in the same period in the prior year.
Selling and marketing expenses increased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2017 as we increase customer outreach and focus on both our OEM and system integrator channels.
The increase is primarily the result of increased net sales.
Working capital was approximately $8,444,000 at March 31, 2018, a decrease of approximately $14,000 from December 31, 2017.
At March 31, 2018, we had no long-term liabilities.
We maintain a line of credit with a commercial bank in the maximum amount of $2,000,000.
No borrowings have been made under our line of credit during the first three months of fiscal year 2018 and there were no outstanding balances at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606).
The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 606 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
The majority of the impact has been on sales returns and the impact has been deemed immaterial.
The Company’s revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services.
