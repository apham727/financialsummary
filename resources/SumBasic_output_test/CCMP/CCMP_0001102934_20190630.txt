The Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2018 were derived from audited financial statements.
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Cabot Microelectronics and its subsidiaries.
All intercompany transactions and balances between the companies have been eliminated as of June 30, 2019.
However, future events are subject to change and estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment.
The Company changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition for customer incentives that provide free products and tiered pricing.
In prior fiscal years, in accordance with ASC 605, we did not consider prospective tiered pricing to represent a material right.
We have determined that the effect of applying the new revenue standard during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 was immaterial to our financial statements compared to revenue guidance in effect before the adoption of the new revenue standard.
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
A majority of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation which represents, in most cases, the products, equipment or services being sold to the customer.
Some contracts include multiple performance obligations, including prospective tiered price discounts or delivery of free product that we have concluded represents a material right.Except as required by law, Cabot Microelectronics undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements made by it to reflect new information, subsequent events or circumstances.
In the Electronic Materials segment, we recorded lower CMP slurries revenue, which was partially offset by higher revenue in CMP pads and electronic chemicals.
CMP slurries have a high participation to memory, and were adversely impacted by the decrease in DRAM and NAND production at our customers this year.
In logic applications, the transition to advanced nodes by many of our top customers is driving increased demand for materials, particularly electronic chemicals.
In our Performance Materials segment, we continue to record strong revenue this quarter, primarily driven by higher demand for our drag-reducing agents.We have identified our Performance Materials segment as another area of potential continued growth and the product offerings in our Performance Materials segment are similarly concentrated.
Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and advances in the industries in which we operate, particularly the semiconductor industry, and to adapt, improve and customize our products in response to evolving customer needs and industry trends.
Our customers continually pursue lower cost of ownership and higher quality and performance of materials consumed in their manufacturing processes, including CMP slurries and pads and electronic chemicals, as a means to reduce costs, increase the yield in their manufacturing facilities, and achieve desired performance of the IC devices they produce.
