Upon adoption of ASC 606 we recognized a $933 decrease to the opening balance of retained earnings, net of tax, due to the cumulative impact of adopting the new revenue standards.
The Company changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition for customer incentives that provide free products and tiered pricing.
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
Some contracts include multiple performance obligations including prospective tiered price discounts or delivery of free product that we have concluded represents a material right.
Customers pay in accordance with negotiated terms upon receipt of goods or completion of services.
For these contracts, the transaction price is determined upon establishment of the contract that contains the final terms of the sale, including the description, quantity, and price of goods or services purchased.
In certain instances, we receive consideration from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a sales contract.
Revenue is recognized on consignment sales when control transfers to the customer, generally at the point of customer usage of the product.
The Company also records revenue for services provided to the pipeline and oilfield energy industries.
These services include preventive maintenance, repair and specialized isolation sealing on pipelines and training.
Standalone selling price, once established, is then used to allocate total consideration proportionally to the various performance obligations within a contract.
