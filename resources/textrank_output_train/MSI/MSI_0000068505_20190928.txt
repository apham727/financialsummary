The accounting for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash or in shares of common stock could have a material effect on our reported financial results.On September 5, 2019, we extended our strategic partnership with Silver Lake with new $1.0 billion 1.75% senior convertible notes.

The reduction of Other charges in the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the third quarter of 2018 is primarily due to a $57 million environmental reserve expense that was recorded in the third quarter of 2018 and $15 million of net reorganization of business charges in the third quarter of 2019 as compared to $21 million in the third quarter of 2018 (see further detail in “Reorganization of Businesses” section).
The decrease in net interest expense in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018 was a result of less average debt outstanding as of and for the period ending September 28, 2019 and higher cash balances generating more interest income as compared to the period ending September 29, 2018.Except for historical matters, the matters discussed in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable federal securities law.Item 5.Under U.S. GAAP, an entity must separately account for the debt component and the embedded conversion option of convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash or in shares of common stock upon conversion, such as our New Senior Convertible Notes, in a manner that reflects the issuer’s effective interest cost.
This difference will be amortized into interest expense over the estimated life of the New Senior Convertible Notes using the effective yield method.
As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discount over the term of the New Senior Convertible Notes.
