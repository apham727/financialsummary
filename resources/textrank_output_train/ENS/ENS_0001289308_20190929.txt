Upon adoption, the Company recorded Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities of approximately $84,878 and $87,248, respectively.
The Company's revenues by reportable segments are presented in Note 17.
Service revenues related to the work performed for the Company’s customers by its maintenance technicians generally represent a separate and distinct performance obligation.
These customized products generally have no alternative use to the Company and the terms and conditions of these arrangements give the Company the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit margin.
For these arrangements, control transfers over time and the Company measures progress towards completion by selecting the input or output method that best depicts the transfer of control of the underlying goods and services to the customer for each respective arrangement.
Methods used by the Company to measure progress toward completion include labor hours, costs incurred and units of production.
Amounts representing work completed and not billed to customers represent contract assets and were $46,319 and $38,778 as of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.
Guidance in Topic 842 is used to evaluate whether the contract has an identified asset; if the Company has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the asset; and if it has the right to direct the use of the underlying asset.
When determining if the Company has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the asset, the Company considers the primary outputs of the identified asset throughout the period of use and determines if it receives greater than 90% of those benefits.
When determining if it has the right to direct the use of an underlying asset, the Company considers if it has the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use and if it controls the decision-making rights over the asset.
The Company exercises its judgment to determine the term of those leases when extension or termination options are present and include such options in the calculation of the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those options.
The Company has elected to include both lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease payments for all asset classes.
