The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company’s 2019 on Form 10-K (SEC File No. 001-32253), which was filed on May 29, 2019 (the “2019 Annual Report”).
The four quarters in fiscal 2020 end on June 30, 2019, September 29, 2019, December 29, 2019, and March 31, 2020, respectively.
The consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially owned subsidiaries that the Company has the ability to control.
Upon adoption, the Company recorded Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities of approximately $84,878 and $87,248, respectively.
Service revenues related to the work performed for the Company’s customers by its maintenance technicians generally represent a separate and distinct performance obligation.
These customized products generally have no alternative use to the Company and the terms and conditions of these arrangements give the Company the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit margin.
For these arrangements, control transfers over time and the Company measures progress towards completion by selecting the input or output method that best depicts the transfer of control of the underlying goods and services to the customer for each respective arrangement.
Methods used by the Company to measure progress toward completion include labor hours, costs incurred and units of production.
Revenues recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, that were included in the contract liability at the beginning of the quarter, amounted to $4,467 and $1,936, respectively.
Amounts representing work completed and not billed to customers represent contract assets and were $42,520 and $38,778 as of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.Lead prices rose for the most part of fiscal 2018, peaked in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and then declined sequentially in every quarter in fiscal 2019.
In fiscal 2018, we entered into a new credit facility (“2017 Credit Facility”) that consisted of a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolver”) and a $150 million senior secured term loan (“2017 Term Loan”) with a maturity date of September 30, 2022.
The amendment resulted in an increase of the 2017 Term Loan and the 2017 Revolver by $299.1 million and $100.0 million, respectively.
Net sales increased $109.3 million or 16.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
This increase was the result of a 22% increase due to the Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a 3% decrease in organic volume, a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact and a 1% decrease in pricing.
The Americas segment’s net sales increased $124.6 million or 31.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 39% increase from the Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a 6% decrease in organic volume and a combined 1% decrease in pricing and foreign currency translation impact.Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures.
