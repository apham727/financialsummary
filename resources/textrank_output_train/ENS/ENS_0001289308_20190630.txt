The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company’s 2019 on Form 10-K (SEC File No. 001-32253), which was filed on May 29, 2019 (the “2019 Annual Report”).
The consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially owned subsidiaries that the Company has the ability to control.
Upon adoption, the Company recorded Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities of approximately $84,878 and $87,248, respectively.
The Company's revenues by reportable segments are presented in Note 17.
Service revenues related to the work performed for the Company’s customers by its maintenance technicians generally represent a separate and distinct performance obligation.
These customized products generally have no alternative use to the Company and the terms and conditions of these arrangements give the Company the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit margin.
For these arrangements, control transfers over time and the Company measures progress towards completion by selecting the input or output method that best depicts the transfer of control of the underlying goods and services to the customer for each respective arrangement.
Methods used by the Company to measure progress toward completion include labor hours, costs incurred and units of production.
On June 30, 2019, the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was approximately $64,647, of which, the Company estimates that approximately $50,030 will be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2020, $14,033 in fiscal 2021, $390 in fiscal 2022, $16 in fiscal 2023 and $178 in fiscal 2024.
Amounts representing work completed and not billed to customers represent contract assets and were $42,520 and $38,778 as of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.
The Company uses historic customer product return data as a basis of estimation for customer returns and records the reduction of sales at the time revenue is recognized.
The Company leases manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, office space, vehicles and other equipment under non-cancellable leases with initial terms typically ranging from 1 to 17 years.
At contract inception, the Company reviews the terms of the arrangement to determine if the contract is or contains a lease.
Guidance in Topic 842 is used to evaluate whether the contract has an identified asset; if the Company has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the asset; and if it has the right to direct the use of the underlying asset.
When determining if a contract has an identified asset, the Company considers both explicit and implicit assets, and whether the supplier has the right to substitute the asset.
When determining if the Company has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the asset, the Company considers the primary outputs of the identified asset throughout the period of use and determines if it receives greater than 90% of those benefits.

In fiscal 2018, we entered into a new credit facility (“2017 Credit Facility”) that consisted of a $600 million senior secured revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolver”) and a $150 million senior secured term loan (“2017 Term Loan”) with a maturity date of September 30, 2022.
Net sales increased $109.3 million or 16.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
This increase was the result of a 22% increase due to the Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a 3% decrease in organic volume, a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact and a 1% decrease in pricing.
The Americas segment’s net sales increased $124.6 million or 31.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 39% increase from the Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a 6% decrease in organic volume and a combined 1% decrease in pricing and foreign currency translation impact.
The EMEA segment’s net sales decreased $7.3 million or 3.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 5% decrease due to foreign currency translation impact and a 2% decrease in pricing, partially offset by a 3% increase in organic volume.
The Asia segment’s net sales decreased $8.0 million or 11.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 8% decrease in organic volume and a 4% decrease in foreign currency translation impact.
Net sales of our reserve power products in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $111.8 million or 34.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The increase was primarily due to a 47% increase from the Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a 10% decrease in organic volume and a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact.
The decrease in organic volume is primarily from the reclassification of sales made to Alpha as intercompany rather than external sales, in the prior year quarter, and the conclusion of a large enclosure order a year ago.
Gross profit increased $36.2 million or 21.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
