The four quarters in fiscal 2018 ended on July 2, 2017, October 1, 2017, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018, respectively.
The consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially owned subsidiaries that the Company has the ability to control.
The Company recognizes revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the performance obligation to a customer.
Control of a performance obligation may transfer to the customer either at a point in time or over time depending on an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances for each contract, including the terms and conditions of the contract as agreed with the customer, as well as the nature of the products or services to be provided.
Service revenues related to the work performed for the Company’s customers by its maintenance technicians generally represent a separate and distinct performance obligation.
A small portion of the Company's customer arrangements oblige the Company to create customized products for its customers that require the bundling of both products and services into a single performance obligation because the individual products and services that are required to fulfill the customer requirements do not meet the definitions for a distinct performance obligation.
These customized products generally have no alternative use to the Company and the terms and conditions of these arrangements give the Company the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit margin.
For these arrangements, control transfers over time and the Company measures progress towards completion by selecting the input or output method that best depicts the transfer of control of the underlying goods and services to the customer for each respective arrangement.
Methods used by the Company to measure progress toward completion include labor hours, costs incurred and units of production.
On July 1, 2018, the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was approximately $65,885, of which, the Company estimates that approximately $45,945 will be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2019, $19,072 in fiscal 2020, $734 in fiscal 2021, $112 in fiscal 2022 and $22 in fiscal 2023.
The Company's typical payment terms are 30 days and sales arrangements do not contain any significant financing component for its customers.
Any payments that are received from a customer in advance, prior to the satisfaction of a related performance obligation and billings in excess of revenue recognized, are deferred and treated as a contract liability.
Amounts representing work completed and not billed to customers represent contract assets and were $28,920 and $24,810 as of July 1, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
If shipping activities are performed after a customer obtains control of a product, the Company applies a policy election to account for shipping as an activity to fulfill the promise to transfer the product to the customer.
