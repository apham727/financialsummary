As a result of the reorganization that occurred in the third quarter 2018, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) began assessing operating profits and identified assets at the enterprise level for resource allocations, and instead of segment managers, the Chief Operating Officer began reporting to maintaining regular contact with the CODM to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, and plans for the entire business.
Beginning with the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company will not report any segment information.

During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company approved a plan to sell its Network Engineering Services business (“Engineering Services”) and shift its focus to research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products.
On July 31, 2017, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of the Company’s Engineering Services business to Gabe’s Construction Co., Inc.
The disposition of Engineering Services qualified as a discontinued operation for reporting purposes due to the material significance of its historical results and because this disposition represented a strategic shift by the Company to focus on products.
As such, the Company reported the results of its Engineering Services business as discontinued operations beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
The Company restated the results of Engineering Services as discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
