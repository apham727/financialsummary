Accounts receivable and other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets.
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company’s cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid AAA rated money market funds that are required to comply with Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The Company restricts its investments in AAA money market funds to those invested 100% in either short-term U.S. government agency securities or bank repurchase agreements collateralized by these same securities.Our third quarter 2019 revenues were $23.6 million and increased by $5.2 million or 28.2% compared to revenues of $18.4 million for the same period in 2018.
Third quarter 2019 revenues increased by $3.7 million or 103.6% to $7.2 million for the test and measurement products compared to the third quarter 2018 and increased by $1.6 million or 10.7% to $16.5 million for the antenna products.
The gross profit of $10.6 million, increased by $3.9 million compared to the same period in 2018 due to both a higher product mix of test and measurement product line revenues and an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products.
Primarily based on higher gross profit margins, we recorded an operating income of $0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to an operating loss of $2.4 million during the third quarter 2018.
Antenna product revenues decreased by $2.6 million or 5.1% to $47.6 million primarily due to lower revenues with enterprise Wi-Fi applications and small cell antennas.
Because of higher gross profit margins, we recorded an operating income of $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to an operating loss of $5.2 million for the same period in 2018.We expect the transition to be substantially completed by the end of our 2020 fiscal year (the “Transition Period”) and we expect to recognize cumulative pre-tax charges of approximately $1.0 million consisting of severance and other transition costs.
