The Company’s operations, engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions were consolidated into a single enterprise-wide organization.
As a result of the Reorganization that occurred in the third quarter 2018, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) began assessing operating profits and identified assets at the enterprise level for resource allocations.
The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations due to its foreign operations and because products are sold internationally.
The functional currency for the Company’s foreign operations is predominantly the applicable local currency.
Accounts of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the applicable balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and average monthly rates prevailing during the period for revenue and expense accounts.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (“Topic 842”), which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements.
The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2019.
The Company completed this project plan, in which it analyzed the ASU's impact on its leases, surveyed the Company's key employees, assessed the portfolio of leases, and established a future lease process to keep the lease accounting portfolio up to date.
The Company adopted this new guidance using the updated modified transition method allowed per ASU 2018-11 of Topic 842.
Cash equivalents are measured at fair value and investments are recognized at amortized cost in the Company’s financial statements.
Accounts receivable and other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets.
At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company’s cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid AAA rated money market funds that are required to comply with Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The Company restricts its investments in AAA money market funds to those invested 100% in either short-term U.S. government agency securities or bank repurchase agreements collateralized by these same securities.
The Company had $1.1 million and $0.8 million of cash and cash equivalents in foreign bank accounts at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
The Company’s cash in its foreign bank accounts is not insured.
Within the cash in foreign bank accounts, the Company had cash of $0.9 million and $0.6 million in China bank accounts at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
As of March 31, 2019, the Company has no intentions of repatriating the cash in its foreign bank accounts in China.
If the Company decides to repatriate the cash in the foreign bank accounts, it may have trouble in doing so in a timely manner.

Revenues decreased for the antenna product line by $2.7 million or 15.1% and increased for the test and measurement product line by $1.5 million or 38.4% compared to the first quarter 2018.
Revenues decreased for the antenna product line due to lower revenues with Enterprise Wi-Fi applications and increased for the test and measurement due to sales of 5G products.
The gross profit of $8.7 million, increased by $0.8 million, or 10.1% compared to gross profit of $7.9M for the same period in 2018, due to a higher mix of test and measurement product revenues and due to an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products.
Primarily based on higher gross margins, we recorded a lower operating loss for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the first quarter 2018.
The operating loss was $0.5 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Because the Reorganization occurred during the third quarter 2018, this Form 10-Q does not include segment reporting information; however, we have included revenues and gross profit for the two major product lines (antenna products and test and measurement products) because each product line has a significantly different gross profit profile.
Revenues decreased 5.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the decrease in revenues for the antenna product line was due to lower sales for Enterprise Wi-Fi applications.
