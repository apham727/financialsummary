In the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the effective tax rates for these periods were lower than the then statutory federal income-tax rates of 21% and 35%, respectively, due to the geographic distribution of the Company’s world-wide earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, federal research tax credits, as well as the recognition of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments.
In its complaint, the Company alleged that Fairchild has and is infringing four of Power Integrations’ patents pertaining to pulse width modulation (PWM) integrated circuit devices.
Fairchild denied infringement and asked for a declaration from the court that it does not infringe any Power Integrations patent and that the patents are invalid.
The Court issued a claim construction order on March 31, 2006 which was favorable to the Company.
At the close of the first trial, on October 10, 2006, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Company finding all asserted claims of all four patents-in-suit to be willfully infringed by Fairchild and awarding $34.0 million in damages.
Fairchild raised defenses contending that the asserted patents are invalid or unenforceable, and the Court held a second trial on these issues beginning on September 17, 2007.

Our net revenues were $109.5 million and $107.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $212.6 million and $212.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase in net revenues for the three month period was due primarily to higher unit sales into the industrial end-market, driven mainly by growth in high-power gate-driver applications.
Net revenues for the six-month period were flat compared with the prior-year period as growth in the industrial, computer and consumer end-markets was offset by lower sales into the communications end-market for cellphone-charger and residential-networking applications.
Our top ten customers, including distributors that resell to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers, accounted for approximately 59% and 58% of our net revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and approximately 57% of net revenues in each of the respective corresponding periods of 2017.
Our top customer, a distributor of our products, accounted for approximately 14% and 15% of our net revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and approximately 16% and 17% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.

The increases in gross margin as compared with the same periods in the prior year were due primarily to a favorable change in end-market mix, with a greater percentage of revenues coming from higher-margin end-markets; cost-reduction efforts also contributed to the increases.
Total operating expenses were $40.6 million and $39.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $80.2 million and $76.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
