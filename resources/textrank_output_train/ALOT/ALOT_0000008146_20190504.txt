The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
The accounting polices used in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q are the same as those used in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended January 31, 2019, except for the change resulting from the adoption of Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as provided below.
Operating Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement of the lease based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of future payments.
Operating lease ROU assets include any lease pre-payments made and exclude lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred when appropriate.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in general and administrative expense on our condensed consolidated statement of income.
Operating leases are included in Right of Use assets, Other Liabilities and Accrued Expenses, and Lease Liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Also upon adoption, the Company elected the package of practical expedients, which, include not reassessing 1) whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases, 2) lease classifications of expired or existing leases, and 3) initial direct costs, if any, for existing leases.
Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of ROU assets and lease liabilities of $2.0 million as of February 1, 2019.
This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 including interim periods within those fiscal years (Q1 fiscal 2021 for AstroNova), with early adoption permitted.
The provisions of ASU 2018-13 relating to changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption.
Our contract liabilities, which represent billings in excess of revenue recognized, are related to advanced billings for purchased service agreements and extended warranties and were $350,000 and $373,000 at May 4, 2019 and January 31, 2019, respectively, and are recorded as deferred revenue in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
The decrease in the deferred revenue balance during the three months ended May 4, 2019 is primarily due to approximately $205,000 of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2019, offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations.
For the three months ended May 4, 2019 and April 28, 2018, the diluted per share amounts do not include common equivalent shares outstanding of 260,422 and 248,480, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
With respect to the acquired intangibles included in the table above, amortization expense of $1.1 million and $1.0 million has been included in the condensed consolidated statements of income for the periods ended May 4, 2019 and April 28, 2018, respectively.
The outstanding balance bears interest at a weighted average annual rate of 5.75% and $19,000 of interest has been incurred on this obligation and included in other expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated income statement for the period ended May 4, 2019.
