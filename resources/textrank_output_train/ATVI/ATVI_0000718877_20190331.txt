In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases.
The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset for its leases.
On January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard.
As a result, we have updated our significant accounting policy disclosure to include our accounting policy for leases under the new standard.
Refer to Note 3 for information about the impact of adoption on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
