Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products.
· the Activision Blizzard Distribution (Distribution) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, there were no significant changes to our accounting policies, except for our adoption of a new revenue accounting standard as discussed below.
Refer to Note 2 contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a summary of our other significant accounting policies.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition.
The new standard replaces all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminates all industry-specific guidance, providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized.
The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments (collectively, the new revenue accounting standard).
Refer to Note 3 for the impact of adoption on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
When control of the promised products and services is transferred to our customers, we recognize revenue in the amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for these products and services.
· recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services.

MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a particular game in a given month.
In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users.
Average MAUs decreased by 22 million, or 6%, for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The sequential decrease in Activisions average MAUs is due primarily to lower MAUs for the Call of Duty franchise.
Average MAUs decreased by 55 million, or 14%, for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry grew, on average, 18% from 2014 to 2017.
