Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Xcerra, which is expected to be a complex, costly and time-consuming process.
In addition, even if Xcerra is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated.
Although we have completed the Merger, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with the Merger, including restructuring expenses and the payment of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and related financing transactions.
Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process, and restructuring charges may significantly exceed original estimates.
These could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.
Furthermore, we expect to incur material restructuring and integration charges in connection with the Merger, which may adversely affect our operating results in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.
Cohu incurred $9.8 million and $0.4 million of acquisition-related costs, and $37.8 million and $10.7 million of restructuring charges, for the Xcerra acquisition during fiscal year 2018 and first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively.
Cohu’s ability to utilize Xcerra’s net operating loss and credit carryforwards is severely limited.
As a result of the Merger an ownership change has occurred at Xcerra and as a consequence Cohu’s ability to utilize Xcerra’s net operating loss and credit carryforwards, that were already partially limited due to a prior acquisition, will be subject to annual limitations as provided for in Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383.
Until these allocations are completed, Cohu can only estimate the allocation of the acquisition price to the net assets acquired and the effect of the allocation on future results.
The use of cash and incurrence of substantial indebtedness in connection with the financing of the Merger may have an adverse impact on Cohu’s liquidity, limit Cohu’s flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase Cohu’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.

For the nine months ended September 28, 2019, our net sales increased 57% year-over-year to $441.3 million.
The increase in our net sales was driven by the acquisition of Xcerra Corporation, completed on October 1, 2018, and our results in the first nine months of 2019 included sales of $238.9 million contributed by this acquired business.
We conduct our annual impairment test as of October 1st of each year, and have determined there was no impairment as of October 1, 2018, as we determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values on that date.
Our consolidated net sales increased 66.5% to $143.5 million in 2019, compared to $86.2 million in 2018.
On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Xcerra and our net sales for the third fiscal quarter of 2019 include $81.3 million of net sales recognized by this business and is the driver of the increase in our net sales.
