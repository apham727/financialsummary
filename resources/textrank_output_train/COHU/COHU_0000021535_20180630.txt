We intend to hold a special meeting of our stockholders on August 30, 2018, to seek stockholder approval for the issuance of additional shares of Cohu common stock as consideration in the Merger.
The Merger cannot be completed until the conditions are satisfied or waived, including receipt of our stockholders’ approval of the issuance of additional shares of Cohu common stock as consideration in the Merger, receipt of Xcerra’s stockholders’ approval of the Merger, and other customary closing conditions.
Any delay in completing the Merger could result in the failure to realize cost synergies projected to result from the Merger and other benefits that Cohu expects to achieve if we successfully complete the Merger within the expected timeframe and integrate the businesses.
Xcerra and members of the Xcerra Board are presently, and Cohu, Merger Sub and members of the Cohu Board may in the future be parties, among others, to various claims and litigation related to the Merger, including putative stockholder class actions.
Cohu could be required to pay a termination fee of $22.8 million to Xcerra under certain circumstances, and Cohu could be required to pay the Financing Termination Fee of $45.0 million if the failure to complete the Merger related to a failure by Cohu to obtain financing;
The occurrence of any of these events, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on Cohu’s results of operations or the trading price of Cohu Common Stock.
Whether or not we complete the Merger, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with the Merger, including payment of certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and related financing transactions.
These could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.
Furthermore, we expect to incur material restructuring and integration charges in connection with the Merger, which may adversely affect our operating results following the closing of the Merger in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.
Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Xcerra, which is a complex, costly and time-consuming process.
In addition, even if Xcerra is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated.

During the first six months of 2018, our net sales increased 11% from the corresponding period of 2017 driven by improved conditions in mobility, IoT (Internet of Things), automotive and industrial semiconductor markets and capturing new customers for semiconductor test handlers and test contactors, along with growth in sales of semiconductor inspection equipment.
We are continuing our investment in new products and are focused on growing sales in our semiconductor test handling and test contactor businesses and expanding into the semiconductor inspection market.
Our gross deferred tax asset balance as of June 30, 2018, was approximately $27.6 million, with a valuation allowance of approximately $21.7 million.
Our deferred tax assets consist primarily of reserves and accruals that are not yet deductible for tax and tax credit and net operating loss carry-forwards.
Other events and changes in circumstances may also require goodwill to be tested for impairment between annual measurement dates.

While Cohu is attempting to address these risks through proactive communications with its existing and prospective customers, suppliers or joint development partners, such parties may be reluctant to continue to do business with Cohu or Xcerra, as applicable, due to the potential uncertainty about, among other things, product offerings and the support and service following the consummation of the Merger.
