The amendments in this ASU require entities to measure all investments in equity securities at fair value with changes recognized through net income.
This requirement does not apply to investments that qualify for the equity method of accounting, to those that result in consolidation of the investee, or for which the entity meets a practicability exception to fair value measurement.
The Company expects to elect the measurement alternative for measurement of equity investments, defined as cost, less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer (the Price Changes) until the equity investments fair value becomes readily determinable.
The ASU amends a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize operating leases with a term greater than one year on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments.
The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
Upon adoption, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from share-based award activity are reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as a component of the provision for income taxes, whereas they previously were recognized in the Shareholders equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The Company also elected to continue to account for share-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures.
