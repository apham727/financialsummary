Noncontrolling interest amounts of $7.1 million and $6.2 million, net of tax, for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $19.0 million and $17.9 million, net of tax, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are included as a reduction within other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
The company will adopt the guidance on a prospective basis as of the effective date.
The guidance requires lessees to recognize right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for most leases in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The guidance also made some changes to lessor accounting, including elimination of the use of third-party residual value guarantee insurance in the lease classification test, and overall aligns with the new revenue recognition guidance.
The company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2019, using the transition option whereby prior comparative periods were not retrospectively presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The company elected the package of practical expedients not to reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs (IDCs) and the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components for all asset classes.
The company made a policy election to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases for all asset classes.
As a lessee, at adoption, the company recognized operating and financing ROU assets of $4.8 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, and operating and financing lease liabilities of $5.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively.
From a lessor perspective, the changes in lease termination guidance and removal of third-party residual value guarantee insurance in the lease classification test did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.
The company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis.
At adoption, $557 million was reclassified from notes and accounts receivable-trade and deferred income-current to prepaid expenses and other current assets to establish the opening balance for net contract assets.
In-scope sales commission costs previously recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings were capitalized in deferred costs in accordance with the transition guidance, in the amount of $737 million.
Additionally, net deferred taxes were reduced by $184 million in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, resulting in a cumulative-effect net increase to retained earnings of $524 million.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the company recognized an additional impact to net deferred taxes and retained earnings of $56 million, resulting in a total net increase to retained earnings of $580 million.

Over the trailing 12 months, total cloud revenue was $20.0 billion, up 5 percent (8 percent adjusted for currency) year to year.
Total expense and other (income) increased 17.3 percent in the third quarter of 2019 versus the prior year primarily driven by higher spending including Red Hat, investments in software and systems innovation, and lower intellectual income (IP) income, partially offset by lower non-operating retirement-related costs and divested businesses.
Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 15.9 percent year to year, driven primarily by the higher spending described above.
Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $1.5 billion decreased 49.2 percent and the pre-tax margin was 8.4 percent, a decrease of 7.5 points versus the prior-year period.
This decline was primarily driven by the purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment (lower revenue without an equivalent adjustment to cost and expense) and the acquisition-related activity.
The continuing operations effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was (9.9) percent, a decrease of 20.1 points compared to the third quarter of 2018.
The year-to-year decrease was primarily driven by a benefit from the realization of a tax only capital loss in a subsidiary (10.7 points), an increase in tax benefits attributable to audit activity (4.3 points), as well as a benefit due to the mix of geographic income year to year (5.0 points), primarily driven by Red Hat. Net income of $1.7 billion decreased 37.9 percent and the net income margin was 9.3 percent, a decrease of 5.1 points year to year.
Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2.4 billion decreased 33.4 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 5.9 points to 13.3 percent.
The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 0.1 percent, a decrease of 12.7 points compared to the third quarter of 2018.
The change in the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was primarily driven by the same factors mentioned above.
Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $2.4 billion decreased 23.6 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 13.3 percent, down 3.4 points year to year.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.87 in the third quarter of 2019 decreased 36.4 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $2.68 decreased 21.6 percent versus the third quarter of 2018.
In the third quarter of 2019, the company repurchased 0.8 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $0.1 billion and had $2.0 billion remaining in the current share repurchase authorization at September 30, 2019.
In the first nine months of 2019, the company reported $55.4 billion in revenue, $5.8 billion in income from continuing operations and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $7.2 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.46 as reported and $8.10 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis.
