The company expects to adopt the guidance on a prospective basis on the effective date.
The new guidance expands the scope of financial instruments subject to impairment, including off-balance sheet commitments and residual value.
The guidance requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The guidance also made some changes to lessor accounting, including elimination of the use of third-party residual value guarantee insurance in the lease classification test, and overall aligns with the new revenue recognition guidance.
The company elected the package of practical expedients not to reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs and the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components for all asset classes.
The company made a policy election to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases for all asset classes.
As a lessee, at adoption, the company recognized operating and financing right-of-use (ROU) assets of $4.8 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, and operating and financing lease liabilities of $5.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively.
The company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis.
The guidance required certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the company recognized an additional impact to net deferred taxes and retained earnings of $56 million, resulting in a total net increase to retained earnings of $580 million.
The remaining performance obligation (RPO) disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized as of the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the company expects to recognize these amounts in revenue.
Additionally, as a practical expedient, the company does not include contracts that have an original duration of one year or less.
For the three months ending March 31, 2018, revenue was reduced by $22 million for performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, mainly due to changes in estimates on percentage-of-completion based contracts.
The amount of revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2019 that was included within the deferred income balance at December 31, 2018 was $3.5 billion and primarily related to services and software.
