Our condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017 and the notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and all of our other filings with the SEC.
Using the fair value hierarchy described in FASB ASC 820 "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," we valued our cash and cash equivalents using Level 1 inputs that were based on quoted market prices.
The fair value of the non-current portion of our Secured Credit Facility as of January 31, 2018 approximates its carrying amount due to its variable interest rate and pricing grid that is dependent upon our leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
We believe the fair value of our non-current portion of capital lease obligations, which currently has a blended interest rate of 5.9%, would not be materially different than its carrying value as of January 31, 2018.
There were no purchases of our common stock during the six months ended January 31, 2018 or 2017.
Weighted average stock options, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding of 1,812,000 and 2,173,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 1,821,000 and 2,305,000 for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in our diluted EPS calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Our EPS calculations exclude 259,000 and 237,000 weighted average performance shares outstanding for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 211,000 and 229,000 weighted average performance shares outstanding for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as the performance conditions have not yet been satisfied.
However, the compensation expense related to these awards is included in net income (the numerator) for EPS calculations for each respective period.
We had $125,000 and $118,000 of retainage included in unbilled receivables at January 31, 2018 and July 31, 2017, respectively, and management estimates that substantially all of the unbilled receivables at January 31, 2018 will be billed and collected within one year.

We believe this segment is a leading provider of command and control applications (such as the design, installation and operation of data networks that integrate computing and communications (including both satellite and terrestrial links)), ongoing network operation and management support services (including telecom expense management, project management and fielding and maintenance solutions related to satellite ground terminals), troposcatter communications (such as digital troposcatter multiplexers, digital over-the-horizon modems, troposcatter systems, and frequency converter systems) and RF power and switching technologies (such as solid state high-power broadband amplifiers, enhanced position location reporting system (commonly known as "EPLRS") amplifier assemblies, identification friend or foe amplifiers, and amplifiers used in the counteraction of improvised explosive devices).
Sales of advanced communication solutions can consist of any one or a combination of items required by our customer including hardware, technology platforms and related support.
Profits expected to be realized on such contracts are based on total estimated sales for the contract compared to total estimated costs, including warranty costs, at completion of the contract.
Such revenues are recognized in accordance with the authoritative guidance contained in FASB ASC 605-25 "Revenue Recognition - Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements" ("FASB ASC 605-25") and, as applicable, FASB ASC 605-20 "Revenue Recognition - Services" ("FASB ASC 605-20") and Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2009-14 (FASB ASC Topic 985) "Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements." Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.
The discount rates used in our DCF method were based on a weighted-average cost of capital ("WACC") determined from relevant market comparisons, adjusted upward for specific reporting unit risks (primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows).
Under the market approach, we estimated a fair value based on comparable companies' market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and factored in a control premium.
We believe that we can achieve fiscal 2018 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 5.0% as compared to fiscal 2017, and Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of consolidated fiscal 2018 net sales, comparable to the 12.8% we achieved in fiscal 2017.
We believe these targeted metrics demonstrate the strength of our business, particularly considering that our fiscal 2017 results include the benefit of $6.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees (which the U.S. Army is no longer obligated to pay us to support the BFT-1 system).
If order flow remains strong and we are able to achieve all of our fiscal 2018 business goals, it is possible that our targeted fiscal 2018 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth rates could be higher.
In line with our original Business Outlook for Fiscal 2018, our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be the peak quarter - by far - for consolidated net sales, GAAP operating income and Adjusted EBITDA.
We currently believe that our third quarter consolidated net sales and Adjusted EBITDA will be approximately 10.0% higher than the related amounts we achieved in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
GAAP operating income and Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of consolidated third quarter fiscal 2018 net sales, are expected to approximate 4.0% and 11.0%, respectively, with significant increases in each metric in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Comparison of the Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 - Adjusted EBITDA."
Net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment were $85.8 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018, as compared to $82.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2017, an increase of $3.7 million, or 4.5%.
Our Commercial Solutions segment represented 64.2% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to 59.1% for the three months ended January 31, 2017.
Bookings during the most recent fiscal quarter were strong and reflect continued strength in almost all of our Commercial Solutions product lines.
