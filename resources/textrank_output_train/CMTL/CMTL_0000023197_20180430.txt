Our condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017 and the notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and all of our other filings with the SEC.
•FASB ASU No. 2017-09 "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718)" ("ASU 2017-09"), issued in May 2017, which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
An entity would not be required to account for changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification if there were no changes to the award’s fair value, vesting conditions and classification.
Using the fair value hierarchy described in FASB ASC 820 "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," we valued our cash and cash equivalents using Level 1 inputs that were based on quoted market prices.
The fair value of the non-current portion of our Secured Credit Facility as of April 30, 2018 approximates its carrying amount due to its variable interest rate and pricing grid that is dependent upon our leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
We believe the fair value of our non-current portion of capital lease and other obligations, which currently has a blended interest rate of 6.0%, would not be materially different than its carrying value as of April 30, 2018.
There were no purchases of our common stock during the nine months ended April 30, 2018 or 2017.
Weighted average stock options, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding of 1,505,000 and 1,912,000 for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 1,804,000 and 2,227,000 for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in our diluted EPS calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Our EPS calculations exclude 260,000 and 227,000 weighted average performance shares outstanding for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 257,000 and 233,000 weighted average performance shares outstanding for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as the performance conditions have not yet been satisfied.

This segment also serves certain large government customers (including the U.S. government) that have requirements for off-the-shelf commercial equipment.
We believe this segment is a leading provider of command and control applications (such as the design, installation and operation of data networks that integrate computing and communications (including both satellite and terrestrial links)), ongoing network operation and management support services (including telecom expense management, project management and fielding and maintenance solutions related to satellite ground terminals), troposcatter communications (such as digital troposcatter multiplexers, digital over-the-horizon modems, troposcatter systems, and frequency converter systems) and RF power and switching technologies (such as solid state high-power broadband amplifiers, enhanced position location reporting system (commonly known as "EPLRS") amplifier assemblies, identification friend or foe amplifiers, and amplifiers used in the counteraction of improvised explosive devices).
Sales of advanced communication solutions can consist of any one or a combination of items required by our customer including hardware, technology platforms and related support.
Profits expected to be realized on such contracts are based on total estimated sales for the contract compared to total estimated costs, including warranty costs, at completion of the contract.
Such revenues are recognized in accordance with the authoritative guidance contained in FASB ASC 605-25 "Revenue Recognition - Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements" ("FASB ASC 605-25") and, as applicable, FASB ASC 605-20 "Revenue Recognition - Services" ("FASB ASC 605-20") and Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2009-14 (FASB ASC Topic 985) "Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements." Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.
The future cash flows for our reporting units were projected based on our estimates, at that time, of future revenues, operating income and other factors (such as working capital and capital expenditures).
The discount rates used in our DCF method were based on a weighted-average cost of capital ("WACC") determined from relevant market comparisons, adjusted upward for specific reporting unit risks (primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows).
During the three months ended April 30, 2018, our Commercial Solutions segment received a large strategic multi-year contract award from the U.S. Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command in the amount of $59.0 million to purchase our SLM-5650B satellite modems, upgrade kits and related services.
We have received initial funding of approximately $8.2 million and given the U.S. Navy's pressing operational needs, we shipped most of these orders during our third quarter, which positively impacted our operating income.
Our Commercial Solutions segment was awarded a $10.1 million multi-year contract to provide one of the largest wireless carriers in the U.S. with a hosted, advanced location services platform.
Given our expectations for the fourth quarter, we expect fiscal 2018 to be a year of net sales and Adjusted EBITDA growth.
Excluding a number of favorable adjustments throughout fiscal 2017, which aggregated $18.8 million and which are more fully discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC, fiscal 2018 is also expected to be a year of operating income growth.
•an annual net sales growth rate of close to 5.0% as compared to fiscal 2017;
•consolidated operating income, as a percentage of net sales, of approximately 5.2% which compares favorably with the 3.3% of consolidated net sales we achieved in fiscal 2017 (excluding the $18.8 million of favorable adjustments that are more fully discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC); 
•Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, of close to 13.0%.
From a timing perspective, our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 is still expected to be the peak quarter for both consolidated net sales and Adjusted EBITDA but our third quarter of fiscal 2018 is now expected to be the peak quarter of consolidated operating income.
As discussed above, our operating income for the third quarter reflects the benefit of shipments of satellite earth station equipment to the U.S. Navy that were previously expected to occur in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
