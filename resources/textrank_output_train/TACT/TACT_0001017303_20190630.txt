TransAct is a global leader in developing and selling software-driven technology and printing solutions for high growth markets including restaurant solutions, point of sale (“POS”) automation and banking, casino and gaming, lottery, and oil and gas.
Net sales for the second quarter of 2019 decreased $3.4 million, or 23%, from the same period in 2018.
Printer, terminal and other hardware sales volume decreased 26% to approximately 29 thousand units for the second quarter of 2019 driven by decreases across all our markets, including, primarily a 21% decrease in unit volume from the casino and gaming market and, to a lesser extent, a 27% decrease in the POS automation and banking market and 77% decrease in the lottery market.
The average selling price of our printers, terminals and other hardware remained consistent during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
International sales for the second quarter of 2019 decreased $0.8 million, or 23%, from the same period in 2018 due primarily to a 27% decrease in sales in the international casino and gaming market.
The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 was driven primarily by BOHA!
terminal sales to two large corporate customers in the second quarter of 2018 that did not reoccur in the second quarter of 2019.
During the second quarter of 2019, we experienced continued growth in our sales of BOHA!
software recognized on a SaaS subscription basis increased by 24% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2019.
The decrease in both domestic and international POS automation and banking product revenue for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a 26% decrease in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, largely to McDonald’s.
We expect sales of our Ithaca® 9000 to McDonald’s to be lower in 2019 compared to 2018.
The decrease in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 was due largely to lower sales of our off-premise gaming printers.
This decrease was partially offset by a slight increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
Additionally, we had slightly higher revenue from recurring EPICENTRALTM annual software maintenance fees during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
Sales of EPICENTRAL™ are project based, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 primarily due to a 50% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers.
General and administrative expenses increased $80 thousand, or 4%, for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher professional and legal expenses.
These increases were partially offset by lower recruiting expense incurred during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.

RISK FACTORS      
In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to depart from the European Union, known as Brexit and subsequently notified the European Council of its intention to leave the E.U. and began to negotiate the terms of the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. upon exit.
We have taken certain actions in response to Brexit and in anticipation of E.U. legal requirements and the U.K.’s separation from the E.U. The potential impact from Brexit on us and on our results of operations is unclear.
