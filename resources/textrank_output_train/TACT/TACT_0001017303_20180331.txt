The Company does have leases for equipment and real property which exceed 12 months and we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our financial statements.
The results for periods before 2018 were not adjusted for the new standard and any cumulative effective of the change in accounting was recognized through retained earnings at the date of adoption.TransAct Technologies Incorporated ("TransAct") is a global leader in developing and selling software-driven technology and printing solutions for high growth markets including restaurant solutions, point of sale ("POS") automation and banking, casino and gaming, lottery, mobile and oil and gas.
Net sales for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $1.8 million, or 13%, from the same period in 2017.
Printer and terminal sales volume decreased 28% to approximately 31 thousand units driven primarily by an 80% decrease in unit volume from the lottery market and a 29% decrease in unit volume in the POS automation and banking market.
These decreases were partially offset by increases in unit volume of 6% from the casino and gaming market and 87% from the restaurant solutions market.
The average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 15% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.
International sales for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $1.4 million, or 41%, from the same period in 2017 primarily due to a decrease in sales in the international lottery market and to a lesser extent a 14% decrease in the international casino and gaming market.
We expect sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 as we benefit from the strategic selling and marketing investments implemented during 2017.
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking product revenue in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by a 27% decrease in domestic sales of our IthacaÂ® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald's slowed compared to the record pace experienced in 2016 and the first quarter of 2017.
We expect sales to McDonald's to decrease for the full year 2018 compared to the full year 2017, as McDonald's completes the implementation of initiatives that use the Ithaca 9000, which began in 2015.Item 1.
