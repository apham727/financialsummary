Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP to be included in full year financial statements.

The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, when the average market price of the common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related stock award during the period.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, there were 540 thousand and 147 thousand, respectively, of potentially dilutive shares consisting of stock awards that were excluded from the calculation of earnings per diluted share.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share, totaling $668 thousand, which was paid on March 15, 2019 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2019.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, dividends declared and paid totaled $673 thousand, or $0.09 per share.
An entity may choose to use either (1) its effective date or (2) the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application.
The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee.
This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively.
A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.

TransAct is a global leader in developing and selling software-driven technology and printing solutions for high growth markets including restaurant solutions, point of sale (“POS”) automation and banking, casino and gaming, lottery, and oil and gas.
We operate in one reportable segment, the design, development, and marketing of software-driven technology and printing solutions for high growth markets, and provide related services, supplies and spare parts.
Net sales for the first quarter of 2019 decreased $0.7 million, or 6%, from the same period in 2018.
Printer, terminal and other hardware sales volume decreased 11% to approximately 28,000 units driven primarily by a 27% decrease in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market and a 5% decrease in unit volume in the casino and gaming market.
International sales for the first quarter of 2019 increased $0.5 million, or 23%, from the same period in 2018 primarily due to increased sales in the international casino and gaming market.
The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions revenue for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was driven largely by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our former U.S. distributor.
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking product revenue for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a 24% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s decreased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
We expect sales of our Ithaca® 9000 to McDonald’s to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.
International casino and gaming product sales increased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to a 77% increase in sales of our thermal casino printers largely to customers in Asia.
This increase was partially offset by a 70% decline in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to Europe, Australia and Asia.
Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
The increase in domestic revenue from TSG for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to an increase in label sales and increased service revenue related to our restaurant solutions products.
Service revenue also increased 24% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
Additionally, we had a 18% increase in sales of our legacy HP inkjet cartridges used in our banking printers.
These increases were offset by a 31% decrease in sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
