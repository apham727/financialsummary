Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of right-of-use assets and lease payment obligations for our real estate office leases of $387.6 million and $417.8 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019.
As of March 31, 2019, $56.4 million of the lease liability was included in other accrued expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Our operating leases are included on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities.
An operating lease asset represents our right to use an underlying asset over the term of a lease while an operating lease liability represents our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date at the present value of the base minimum rent payments.
Operating lease assets are also recognized at the commencement date as the total operating lease liability plus prepaid rents and less any deferred rent liabilities that existed under ASC 840.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated secured incremental borrowing rate based on the significant geographic regions in which we operate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
We recognized operating lease expense of $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 related to these lease agreements.
Our total operating lease costs were $19.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Cash paid for amounts included in the present value of operating lease liabilities was $19.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and is included in operating cash flows.
Our weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rates as of March 31, 2019 were 8.5 years and 4.9%, respectively.
Total gross sublease and other rental income recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2019 was approximately $2.5 million.
