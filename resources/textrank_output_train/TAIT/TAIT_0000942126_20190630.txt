In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard on leasing.
The new standard will require companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also proposes a dual model for recognizing expense.
We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and the adoption of these accounting changes have not impacted our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets.
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
The adoption of this guidance has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Income tax provision was $1,000 for both the second quarter of 2019 and 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019.

Net sales in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $3,156,000 versus $3,805,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $649,000 or 17% over the same period last year.

Other income, net of other expenses, in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $56,000 versus $77,000 in the comparable period for 2018.
