This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 with early adoption permitted.
We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and we are preparing for the changes to be made to our consolidated financial statements.
We expect the adoption of these accounting changes will not impact our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets.
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
We expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
The primary impact of adoption relates to additional disclosures and presentation of revenue by primary geographical market, major product line and the timing of revenue recognition.
