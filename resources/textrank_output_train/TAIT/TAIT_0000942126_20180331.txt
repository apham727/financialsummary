In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting standard which simplified certain aspects of the accounting for stock-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards and classification in the statement of cash flows.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

Sales returns for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $2,000 and $111,000, respectively.
The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 aggregated $42,000 and $40,000, respectively.
Inventory – Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) or net realizable value.
We had inventory balances in the amount of $4,409,000 and $4,990,000 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of $7,910,000 and $7,848,000, respectively.
