In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new accounting standard on leasing.
The new standard will require companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also proposes a dual model for recognizing expense.
This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 with early adoption permitted.
We have evaluated the impact of adopting this guidance and we are preparing for the changes to be made to our consolidated financial statements.
We expect the adoption of these accounting changes will not impact our assets and liabilities nor our net income or equity, as we currently do not lease any assets.
In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting standard which simplified certain aspects of the accounting for stock-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards and classification in the statement of cash flows.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
This guidance will be effective for the year ending December 31, 2019 and interim reporting periods within that year.

Due to the complexity of managing and maintaining a large inventory of product offerings, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the cost of inventories.
Based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions, inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
If our assumptions about future demand change, or market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs of inventories may be required.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our March 31, 2018, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 50% of current assets and 34% of total assets.
However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash.
