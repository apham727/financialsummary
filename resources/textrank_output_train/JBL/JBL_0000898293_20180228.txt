The Company has made certain reclassification adjustments to conform prior periods Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to the current presentation.
Results for the six months ended February 28, 2018 are not necessarily an indication of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year ending August 31, 2018.
On October 6, 2017, the Companys Compensation Committee approved the modification of vesting criteria for certain performance-based restricted stock awards granted in fiscal year 2015.
As a result of the modification, 0.8 million awards vested during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, which resulted in approximately $24.9 million of stock-based compensation expense recognized.
During the six months ended February 28, 2018, the Companys five largest customers accounted for approximately 51% of its net revenue and 74 customers accounted for approximately 90% of its net revenue.
Transactions between operating segments are generally recorded at amounts that approximate those at which the Company would transact with third parties.
(3) During the three months ended February 28, 2018, the Company issued $500.0 million of publicly registered 3.950% Senior Notes due 2028 (the 3.950% Senior Notes).
The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including to redeem $400.0 million of the Companys outstanding 8.250% Senior Notes due 2018 and pay related costs and a make-whole premium.
As of February 28, 2018, the Company has $2.2 billion in available unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities.
The estimated fair values of the Companys publicly traded debt, including the 5.625%, 4.700% and 3.950% senior notes, were approximately $424.4 million, $517.5 million and $480.2 million, respectively, as of February 28, 2018.
The estimated fair value of the Companys private debt, the 4.900% senior notes, was approximately $306.5 million, as of February 28, 2018.
The Company regularly sells designated pools of trade accounts receivable under two asset-backed securitization programs and seven uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs (collectively referred to herein as the programs).
Servicing fees related to each of the programs recognized during the three months and six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 were not material.
The Company does not record a servicing asset or liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company estimates that the fee it receives to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities.
The special purpose entity in the North American asset-backed securitization program is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
The Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of this special purpose entity as the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive the benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity from the transfer of the trade accounts receivable into the special purpose entity.
