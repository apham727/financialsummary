On October 6, 2017, the Companys Compensation Committee approved the modification of vesting criteria for certain performance-based restricted stock awards granted in fiscal year 2015.
As a result of the modification, 0.8 million awards vested during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, which resulted in approximately $24.9 million of stock-based compensation expense recognized.
During the nine months ended May 31, 2018, the Companys five largest customers accounted for approximately 50% of its net revenue and 77 customers accounted for approximately 90% of its net revenue.
Transactions between operating segments are generally recorded at amounts that approximate those at which the Company would transact with third parties.
(3)  During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company issued $500.0 million of publicly registered 3.950% Senior Notes due 2028 (the 3.950% Senior Notes).
The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including to redeem $400.0 million of the Companys outstanding 8.250% Senior Notes due 2018 and pay related costs and a make-whole premium.
The estimated fair values of the Companys publicly traded debt, including the 5.625%, 4.700% and 3.950% Senior Notes, were approximately $419.5 million, $514.1 million and $481.7 million, respectively, as of May 31, 2018.
The estimated fair value of the Companys private debt, the 4.900% Senior Notes, was approximately $306.5 million, as of May 31, 2018.
The Company regularly sells designated pools of trade accounts receivable under two asset-backed securitization programs and seven uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs (collectively referred to herein as the programs).
The Company continues servicing the receivables sold and in exchange receives a servicing fee under each of the programs.
Servicing fees related to each of the programs recognized during the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 were not material.
The Company does not record a servicing asset or liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company estimates that the fee it receives to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities.
Transfers of the receivables under the programs are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, net receivables sold under the programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The special purpose entity in the North American asset-backed securitization program is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
