ASU 2014-09 requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments.

In our opinion, the proceedings and actions in which we are involved should not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, or cash flows.
The global markets in which we operate are highly competitive.
Actions that may be taken by competitors, including pricing, business alliances, new product introductions, market penetration, and other actions, could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability.
Moreover, some competitors that are highly leveraged both financially and operationally could become more aggressive in their pricing of products.
Volatility of credit markets could adversely affect our business.
Uncertainty in U.S. and global financial and equity markets could make it more expensive for us to conduct our operations and more difficult for our customers to buy our products.
In order to meet the goals in our strategic plan, we must grow our business, both organically and through acquisitions.
