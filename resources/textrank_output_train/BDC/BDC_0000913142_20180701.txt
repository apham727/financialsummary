The six months ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017 included 182 and 183 days, respectively.
Effective January 1, 2018, we changed our organizational structure and, as a result, now are reporting two segments.
During the financial closing process for the fourth quarter of 2017, we determined that certain consolidated financial statement amounts were not recorded correctly in prior interim periods of 2017.
The errors primarily related to recognizing revenue prior to satisfying all of the delivery criteria in one business within our Enterprise segment.
The impact of the errors in the three months ended July 2, 2017 was an overstatement of revenues and net income of $10.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
The impact of the errors in the six months ended July 2, 2017 was an overstatement of revenues and net income of $16.5 million and $4.3 million, respectively.
We classify cash on hand and deposits in banks, including commercial paper, money market accounts, and other investments with an original maturity of three months or less, that we hold from time to time, as cash and cash equivalents.
In March 2018, a panel of three judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a Rule 36 Affirmance, without written opinion, of the District Court's final judgment that Corning, among other things, willfully infringed the PPC universal compression patents at issue in the case, and that PPC should be awarded about $61.8 million, plus accrued interest.
We received a pre-tax amount of approximately $62.1 million from Corning on July 19, 2018.
We did not record any amounts in our consolidated financial statements related to this matter in the second quarter but will record the cash received as a gain in our third quarter financial statements.
For such arrangements, we allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.
The transaction price for certain contracts are subject to variable consideration for estimated rebates, price allowances, invoicing adjustments, and product returns.
We use the most likely amount method for estimating rebates and the expected value method for estimating price allowances, invoicing adjustments, and product returns.
Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in our revenues.
We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance.
Sales commissions for which the related service or support contract extends beyond one year are capitalized in other current or long-lived assets and recognized as expense over the related service or support period.
In the event the related service or support period is twelve months or less, we apply the practical expedient and expense the sales commissions when incurred.

We recognized $20.3 million and $29.5 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, respectively.
