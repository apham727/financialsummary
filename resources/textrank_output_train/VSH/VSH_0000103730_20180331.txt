The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the ASU on its lease contracts.In December 2015, we amended our credit facility to increase our ability to repurchase shares of stock or pay cash dividends.
No repurchases were made in the first fiscal quarter of 2018.
As part of the amendment and restatement of the revolving credit facility in December 2015, we completed an evaluation of our anticipated domestic cash needs over the next several years and our most efficient use of liquidity, with consideration of the amount of cash that can be repatriated to the U.S. efficiently with lesser withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
Additionally, we continue to closely monitor our costs, inventory, and capital resources to respond to changing conditions and to ensure we have the management, business processes, and resources to meet our future needs.
In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, we substantially completed our cost reduction programs, which had been ongoing since 2013.
Our cost reduction programs are more fully described in Note 4 to the consolidated condensed financial statements included in Item 1, and in "Cost Management" below.
We utilize several financial metrics, including net revenues, gross profit margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, change in average selling prices, net cash and short-term investments (debt), and free cash generation to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
In the first fiscal quarter of 2018, we retrospectively adopted two new accounting standards, which impacted previously reported net revenues, gross profit margin, and segment operating income.
We experienced a continued high level of demand in virtually all end-markets in the first fiscal quarter of 2018.
Net revenues increased significantly versus the prior fiscal quarter and the prior year quarter.
The strong order levels of 2017 continued in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 and resulted in continued strong metrics and an increase in nearly all key financial metrics compared to the prior quarter and prior year quarter.10.1   Employment Agreement, dated February 15, 2018, between Vishay Europe GmbH (an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.), Vishay Intertechnology, Inc., and Lori Lipcaman.10.1   Employment Agreement, dated February 15, 2018, between Vishay Europe GmbH (an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.), Vishay Intertechnology, Inc., and Lori Lipcaman.
