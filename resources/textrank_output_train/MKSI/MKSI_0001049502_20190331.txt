This standard requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for all leases, with certain exceptions, on the balance sheet.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, and used the effective date as its date of initial application.

Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of initially applying this new standard, resulting in the addition of $71,042 of right-of-use assets and $20,192 and $54,147 of short-term and long-term lease liabilities, respectively.

The Company has existing net leases in which the non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance, maintenance, consumables, etc.) are paid separately from rent based on actual costs incurred.
Therefore, non-lease components are not included in the right-of-use asset and lease liability and are reflected as expenses in the periods incurred.

Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments or securities or derivative contracts that are valued using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
