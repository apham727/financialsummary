In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments which amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on expected losses rather than incurred losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and will adopt the standard on the first day of the Company’s 2021 fiscal year.
Effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases.
This ASU requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets related to the rights and obligations created by those leases.
The ASU also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to the nature, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
The Company adopted this standard on the first day of the 2020 fiscal year, using a modified retrospective approach.
Therefore, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset of $4,398,300 and lease liabilities of $4,420,800 for operating leases as of June 30, 2019.
Effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company, included herein.

Our first quarter fiscal 2020 revenue decreased by 13.4% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
First quarter fiscal 2020 revenue in the commercial segment and retail segment decreased 6.8% and 28.8%, respectively, as compared to the first fiscal quarter of 2019.
The decline in our commercial segment revenue was driven by a decrease in our public carrier market due to the project-oriented nature of this business.
Several large customers either adjusted their forecasts or pushed out their product requirements from the first fiscal quarter into the remainder of the year.
For the retail segment, revenue decreased due to significantly lower revenues from one of our more significant retail customers following its recent acquisition, change in business model and subsequent transition of its business elsewhere, as well as ongoing overall market softness.
Among our product categories, revenue decreased in our base station infrastructure, network systems, installation, test and maintenance, and mobile device accessories categories by 7.1%, 1.0%, 18.9% and 28.7%, respectively, for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to the same quarter last year.
Our first quarter fiscal year 2020 gross profit decreased by 17.7%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
The decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of the decrease in revenue discussed above.

Selling, General and Administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 were down 3.0% compared to the first quarter fiscal year 2019.
