The Company provides marketing and sales services, knowledge and supply chain management, product-solution delivery and control systems utilizing extensive internet and information technology.
Approximately 97% of the Company’s sales are made to customers in the United States.
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments which amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on expected losses rather than incurred losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and will adopt the standard on the first day of the Company’s 2021 fiscal year.
Effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases.
The Company adopted this standard on the first day of the 2020 fiscal year, using a modified retrospective approach.
This standard resulted in the Company recording a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases, but otherwise the standard did not have a material impact on the financial statements.
Effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company, included herein.
The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal quarter and six months ended September 29, 2019 includes $391,800 and $730,700, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal quarter and six months ended September 30, 2018 includes $384,800 and $705,300, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
Non-cash stock-based compensation expense is primarily related to our Performance Stock Units (PSUs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) and Stock Options, granted or outstanding under the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Stock and Incentive Plan (the “1994 Plan”) and 2019 Stock and Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan” and together with the 1994 Plan, the “Plans”), which was approved at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on July 25, 2019.

Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased 10.6% compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Revenues in our public carrier market, value-added resellers and integrators market and retail market decreased by 1.3%, 6.1% and 24.1%, respectively.
The decline in the commercial segment was primarily due to a decrease in revenue in our value-added resellers and integrators market where we are not yet realizing the full benefits of our sales reorganization.
The decline in the retail segment was driven by significantly lower revenues from one of our more significant retail customers following its acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, change in business model and subsequent transition of its business elsewhere, as well as ongoing overall market softness.
Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased by 16.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019.

Within our commercial segment, gross profit margin in our public carrier market increased from 12.0% to 12.4% due to changes in customer mix.
Gross profit margin in our value-added resellers and integrators market decreased from 24.6% to 23.8%.
This decline was due to a change in product mix, including lower sales of our higher margin Ventev products in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
Within our retail segment, gross profit margin decreased from 19.3% to 16.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to the impact of tariffs.
