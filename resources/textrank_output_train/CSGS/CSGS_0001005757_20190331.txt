Revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $244.8 million, a 21% increase when compared to revenues of $201.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the additional revenues generated from the acquisitions of Forte on October 1, 2018 and Business Ink on February 28, 2018, and the continued growth in our cloud solutions and managed service arrangements.
Operating income for the first quarter of 2019 was $32.1 million, or a 13.1% operating margin percentage, compared to $25.8 million, or a 12.8% operating margin percentage for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in operating income is primarily a result of the higher revenues generated in the first quarter of 2019, as reflected by our relatively consistent operating margin percentage.
As of March 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $141.9 million, as compared to $162.9 million as of December 31, 2018.
Our cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter of 2019 were $12.8 million.
A large percentage of our historical revenues have been generated from our two largest clients, which are Comcast and Charter Corporation Inc.
Comcast continues to be our largest client, generating 22% of our total revenues for the first quarter of 2019.
Cloud and Related Solutions Revenues.
Cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $219.6 million, a 24% increase when compared to $177.5 million for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in cloud and related solutions revenues between periods is primarily due to the additional revenues generated from the acquired Business Ink and Forte businesses, discussed above, and to a lesser degree, the execution of and performance under managed services and Ascendon arrangements.
Software and services revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $13.0 million, a 9% increase when compared to $12.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the timing of work performed and execution of software license agreements.
Cost of Revenues.
The cost of cloud and related solutions for the first quarter of 2019 increased 32% to $114.7 million, from $86.9 million for the first quarter of 2018.
This increase can be mainly attributed to the cloud and related solutions expense of the acquired Business Ink and Forte businesses included in our results, to include acquisition amortization, and increased employee-related costs.
Total cloud and related solutions cost as a percentage of cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 52.2% and 49.0%, respectively (with the first quarter of 2019 reflective of the transaction fees of $17.1 million).
The cost of software and services for the first quarter of 2019 was $8.8 million, a slight increase from $8.5 million for the first quarter of 2018.
Total software and services cost as a percentage of our software and services revenues for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 67.9% and 71.4%, respectively.
Variability in quarterly revenues and operating results are inherent characteristics of companies that sell software licenses and perform professional services.
The cost of maintenance for the first quarter of 2019 was $5.5 million, a slight decrease from $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2018.
Total cost of maintenance as a percentage of our maintenance revenues for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 44.8% and 46.2%, respectively.

The interest rate on our 2016 Convertible Notes is fixed, and thus, as it relates to our convertible debt borrowings, we are not exposed to changes in interest rates.
Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments.
Certain of our cash balances are “swept” into overnight money market accounts on a daily basis, and at times, any excess funds are invested in low-risk, somewhat longer term, cash equivalent instruments and short-term investments.
Our cash equivalents are invested primarily in institutional money market funds, commercial paper, and time deposits held at major banks.
