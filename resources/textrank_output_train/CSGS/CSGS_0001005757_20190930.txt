We are one of the world’s leading revenue management and digital monetization, customer experience, and payment solutions providers, and a trusted partner to some of the most well-known communications, media, and entertainment companies around the globe.
We offer revenue management, customer experience, and digital monetization solutions for every stage of the customer lifecycle so service providers can deliver an outstanding customer experience that adapts to their customers’ rapidly changing demands.
Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 we generated 87% of our revenues from the Americas region, 9% of our revenues from the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and 4% of our revenues from the Asia Pacific region.
Because we control the integrated service provided under our payment services client contracts, these transaction fees are presented gross, and not netted against revenues.
Revenues for the third quarter of 2019 were $251.4 million, an 18% increase when compared to revenues of $213.1 million for the third quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the additional revenues generated from the acquisition of Forte on October 1, 2018, and the continued growth in our cloud solutions and managed service arrangements.
The increase in operating income is primarily a result of higher revenues generated in the third quarter of 2019.
As of September 30, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $172.0 million, as compared to $131.5 million as of June 30, 2019 and $162.9 million as of December 31, 2018.
Our cash flows from operating activities for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 were $79.1 million.
In November 2018, Comcast exercised the first of their two one-year renewal options extending the term of their agreement through June 30, 2020.
Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, Comcast has the right to exercise an additional one-year renewal option no later than January 1, 2020, to extend the term of the Agreement through June 30, 2021.
We continue to transition our focus towards more predictable recurring revenues models with our managed services arrangements and delivery of our cloud-based solutions and away from large transactional software and services deals with related maintenance agreements.
Variability in quarterly revenues and operating results are inherent characteristics of companies that sell software licenses and perform professional services.
As of September 30, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $172.0 million, as compared to $131.5 million as of June 30, 2019 and $162.9 million as of December 31, 2018.
As part of our 2018 Credit Agreement, we have a $200 million senior secured revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in March 2023.
As of September 30, 2019, we had $2.8 million of cash restricted as to use primarily to collateralize outstanding letters of credit.
Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 reflect the negative impacts of the payment of the 2018 and 2017 year-end accrued employee incentive compensation in the first quarter subsequent to the year-end accrual for these items.
Additionally, cash flows from operating activities for the first and second quarters of 2019, and the second quarter of 2018, were negatively impacted by the timing around certain recurring client payments that were received subsequent to quarter-end.
Management of our billed accounts receivable is one of the primary factors in maintaining consistently strong quarterly cash flows from operating activities.
Cash Dividends Paid on Common Stock.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, we repurchased approximately 485,000 and 395,000 shares of our common stock, respectively, under the guidelines of our Stock Repurchase Program for $20.6 million and $16.9 million, respectively, and paid $21.0 million and $16.8 million, respectively, through September 30, 2019 and 2018 (with the differences attributed to the timing of share settlement ).

The interest rate on our 2016 Convertible Notes is fixed, and thus, as it relates to our convertible debt borrowings, we are not exposed to changes in interest rates.
Certain of our cash balances are “swept” into overnight money market accounts on a daily basis, and at times, any excess funds are invested in low-risk, somewhat longer term, cash equivalent instruments and short-term investments.
Our cash equivalents are invested primarily in institutional money market funds, commercial paper, and time deposits held at major banks.
We have minimal market risk for our cash and cash equivalents due to the relatively short maturities of the instruments.
