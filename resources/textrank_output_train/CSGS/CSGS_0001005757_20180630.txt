In conjunction with the adoption of this ASU, we recorded a cumulative adjustment increasing beginning retained earnings (net of tax) by approximately $7 million, primarily related to contracts that we were required to defer revenue as we did not have VSOE for certain undelivered elements.
Investments in client contracts on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows have been reclassified to operating activities from investing activities.
As discussed in Note 5 to the Financial Statements, on February 28, 2017 we acquired Business Ink, a multi-channel communications company based in Austin, Texas, for approximately $70 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses.
For the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018, Business Ink contributed cloud and related solutions revenues of $15.7 million and $21.0 million, respectively, of and was slightly dilutive to our results of operations when factoring in acquired amortization expense.
Operating income for the second quarter of 2018 was $24.1 million, or an 11.3% operating income margin percentage, compared to $24.2 million, or a 12.6% operating income margin percentage for the second quarter of 2017, with the decrease in operating margin reflective of costs associated with the integration of Business Ink and the continued increase in planned investments aimed at generating future long-term growth in our business.
As of June 30, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $186.4 million, as compared to $222.1 million as of March 31, 2018 and $261.4 million as of as of December 31, 2017.
Our cash flows from operating activities for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 were $(3.6) million, which were negatively impacted by an increase in accounts receivable primarily related to the timing around a recurring client payment that was delayed at quarter-end.
In March 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement (see Note 4 to our Financial Statements).
As a result, we incurred a loss of $0.8 million related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.
The effective income tax rates for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018 reflect the impact of the Tax Reform Act that was passed into legislation in December 2017.
The lower effective income tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017 reflects an approximately $5 million net benefit resulting from Comcast’s exercise of 1.4 million vested stock warrants in January 2017, as the stock warrants appreciated in value since their vesting, resulting in an income tax benefit to us when exercised.
As of June 30, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $186.4 million, as compared to $222.1 million as of March 31, 2018 and $261.4 million as of as of December 31, 2017.
During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement primarily to extend the term of the loan from February 2020 to March 2023 and obtain a reduction in the interest rate and other fees.
The 2018 Credit Agreement increased our liquidity and capital resources position by approximately $30 million.
As part of our 2018 Credit Agreement, we have a $200 million senior secured revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in March 2023.
As of June 30, 2018, we had $2.0 million of cash restricted as to use primarily to collateralize outstanding letters of credit.
Cash flows from operating activities for the second quarter of 2018 was negatively impacted primarily by the increase in the accounts receivable balance mainly related to the timing of a recurring payment from a significant client that was delayed and received subsequent to quarter-end.
We believe the above table illustrates our ability to generate recurring quarterly cash flows from our operations, and the importance of managing our working capital items.
Management of our billed accounts receivable is one of the primary factors in maintaining consistently strong quarterly cash flows from operating activities.
Accrued employee compensation decreased $18.5 million to $44.5 million as of June 30, 2018, from $63.0 million as of December 31, 2017, due primarily to the payment of the 2017 employee incentive compensation that was fully accrued at December 31, 2017, offset to a certain degree by the accrual for the 2018 employee incentive compensation.
As a result of the application of ASC 606, $3.5 million of investments in client contracts have been included in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018.

The interest rate on our 2016 Convertible Notes is fixed, and thus, as it relates to our convertible debt borrowings, we are not exposed to changes in interest rates.

Certain of our cash balances are “swept” into overnight money market accounts on a daily basis, and at times, any excess funds are invested in low-risk, somewhat longer term, cash equivalent instruments and short-term investments.
