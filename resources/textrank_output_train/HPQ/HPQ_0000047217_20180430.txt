A detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment net revenue is included in “Segment Information” below.
For the three months ended April 30, 2018, our gross margin increased 0.1 percentage points as compared to the prior-year period.
The increase was primarily driven by an improved rate in Personal Systems due to higher average selling prices (“ASPs”), partially offset by higher commodity costs in Personal Systems and higher Commercial Hardware unit placements in Printing.
For the six months ended April 30, 2018, our gross margin remained flat, as compared to the prior-year period.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased 15.6% and 15.3% for the three and six months ended April 30, 2018, respectively, as compared to the prior-year periods, primarily driven by the acquisition of Samsung’s printer business and incremental go-to-market investments to support revenue growth.
Restructuring and other charges for the three and six months ended April 30, 2018 relate primarily to the Fiscal 2017 Plan and certain non-recurring costs, including those as a result of the Separation.
Acquisition-related charges for the three and six months ended April 30, 2018 relate primarily to third-party professional and legal fees, and integration-related costs, as well as fair value adjustments of certain acquired assets such as inventory.
Interest and other, net expense increased by $817 million and $804 million for the three and six months ended April 30, 2018, respectively, as compared to the prior-year periods, primarily due to reversal of indemnification receivables from Hewlett Packard Enterprise pertaining to various audit settlements, and loss on extinguishment of debt.
