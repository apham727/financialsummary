Product revenue related to orders where the customer requires the Company to install the product is recognized when the product is installed.
In situations where the Company is responsible for re-imaging programs with multiple sites, each site is viewed as a separate unit of accounting and has stand-alone value to the customer.
Revenue is recognized upon the Company’s complete performance at the location, which may include a site survey, graphics products, lighting products, and installation of products.
The selling price assigned to each site is based upon an agreed upon price between the Company and its customer and reflects the estimated selling price for that site relative to the selling price for sites with similar image requirements.
The following table presents the Company’s net accounts receivable at the dates indicated.
The Company maintains balances at financial institutions in the United States.

The computation of diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period and includes common share equivalents.
Common share equivalents include the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock units, contingently issuable shares and common shares to be issued under a deferred compensation plan, all of which totaled 856,000 and 297,000 shares for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 289,000 shares and 853,000 shares for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
