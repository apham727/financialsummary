A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation in its customer contracts or purchase orders.
Most of the Company’s products have a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer.
For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
The Company offers standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations.
The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties.
The Company also offers installation services.
The Company disaggregates the revenue from contracts with customers by the timing of revenue recognition because the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, and timing of our revenue and cash flows.
The Company’s contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, as such the Company applies the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred, and have omitted disclosures on the amount of remaining performance obligations.

Fiscal 2019 second quarter net sales of $89,541,000 decreased $2.8 million or 3% as compared to second quarter fiscal 2018 net sales of $92,305,000.
Net sales were favorably influenced by increased net sales of the Graphics Segment (up $2.8 million or 12%) more than offset by decreased net sales of the Lighting Segment (down $5.5 million or 8%).
Fiscal 2019 second quarter operating loss of $(20.3) million represents a $24.8 million change from operating income of $4.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
The $24.8 million change from operating income in fiscal 2018 to an operating loss in fiscal 2019 was mostly the result of a pre-tax $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge in the Lighting Segment in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Adjusted fiscal 2019 second quarter operating income of $1.5 million decreased $3.1 million or 66% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $4.6 million.
The decrease in adjusted operating income was the result of decreased net sales and decreased gross profit slightly offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses.
Adjusted first half fiscal 2019 operating income of $5.1 million decreased $2.8 million or 35% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $7.8 million.
The decrease in adjusted operating income was the result of decreased net sales and decreased gross profit slightly offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses.
Also contributing to the period-over-period results is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million.
Lighting Segment net sales of $63,654,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 8% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $69,174,000.

The Graphics Segment second quarter fiscal 2019 operating income of $861,000 decreased $1.4 million or 62% from operating income of $2,255,000 in the same period of fiscal 2018.
The decrease of $1.4 million was primarily the net result of a shift in customer mix on higher sales and an increase in selling and administrative expenses.
Administrative expenses of $2,667,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $0.3 million from the same period of the prior year.
The Company reported $615,000 net interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $417,000 net interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
