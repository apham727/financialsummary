In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements include all normal adjustments and disclosures necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of  September 30, 2018, the results of its operations for the three month periods ended  September 30, 2018 and 2017, and its cash flows for the three month periods ended  September 30, 2018 and 2017.
A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation in its customer contracts or purchase orders.
For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties.
On  July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09.
Results for reporting periods beginning  July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period.
The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $591,000 on  July 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, as described below.
In  February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after  December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact the amended guidance will have on its financial statements.Fiscal 2019 first quarter net sales of $84,957,000 decreased $2.5 million or 2.9% as compared to first quarter fiscal 2018.
Fiscal 2019 first quarter operating income of $2.9 million increased $27.7 million from an operating loss of $(24,814,000) in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The $27.7 million change from an operating loss in fiscal 2018 to operating income in fiscal 2019 was mostly the result of a pre-tax $28 million goodwill impairment charge in the Lighting Segment in fiscal 2018.
Adjusted fiscal 2019 operating income of $3.5 million (which reflects the removal of plant closure costs) increased 10.6% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $3.2 (which reflects the removal of the goodwill impairment).
Also contributing to the period-over-period results is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million.
The Company believes it is appropriate to evaluate its performance after making adjustments to the as-reported U.S. GAAP operating income, net income, and earnings per share.
Lighting Segment net sales of $61,432,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 10.2% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $68,428,000.
