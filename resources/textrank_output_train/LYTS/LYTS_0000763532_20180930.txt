A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation in its customer contracts or purchase orders.
Most of the Company’s products have a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer.
For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
The Company offers standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations.
The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties.
The Company also offers installation services.
The Company disaggregates the revenue from contracts with customers by the timing of revenue recognition because we believe it best depicts the nature, amount, and timing of our revenue and cash flows.
The Company’s contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, as such we apply the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred, and have omitted disclosures on the amount of remaining performance obligations.
On  July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09.
The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $591,000 on  July 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, as described below.
In  February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after  December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted.

Fiscal 2019 first quarter operating income of $2.9 million increased $27.7 million from an operating loss of $(24,814,000) in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The $27.7 million change from an operating loss in fiscal 2018 to operating income in fiscal 2019 was mostly the result of a pre-tax $28 million goodwill impairment charge in the Lighting Segment in fiscal 2018.
Adjusted fiscal 2019 operating income of $3.5 million (which reflects the removal of plant closure costs) increased 10.6% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $3.2 (which reflects the removal of the goodwill impairment).
The increase in adjusted operating income was the result of decreased net sales and decreased gross profit more than offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses.
Also contributing to the period-over-period results is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million.
Lighting Segment net sales of $61,432,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 10.2% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $68,428,000.
The Lighting Segment’s net sales of light fixtures having solid-state LED technology totaled $49.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 which represent 91% of total lighting product net sales.
Selling and administrative expenses of $3,395,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $0.2 million or 5.4% from the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of decreased wage and benefit expense.
Administrative expenses of $3,307,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased slightly from the same period of the prior year.
The change is primarily the result of a decrease in employee compensation and benefit expense ($0.6 million) offset by an equal an increase in outside service expense ($0.4 million), and a net increase in various other expense categories ($0.2 million).
The Company reported $518,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $403,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The change from interest expense from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is the result of higher interest rates on the Company’s line of credit and higher commitment fees on its unused portion of the line of credit.
The Company reported a net income of $1,749,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a net loss of $(15,629,000) in the same period of the prior year.
