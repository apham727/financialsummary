In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements include all normal adjustments and disclosures necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2019, the results of its operations for the three month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, and its cash flows for the three month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.
A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Significant changes to our accounting policies as a result of adopting ASU-2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and adopting ASU 2016-02, “Leases” in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, which are discussed below.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligations in its customer contracts or purchase orders.
For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties.
On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09.
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective adoption method which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
Results for reporting periods beginning July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period.
The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $591,000 on July 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, as described below.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the new guidance to not reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification, and initial direct costs.
In addition, the Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease component and the accounting policy election to not present leases with an initial term of twelve months or less on the balance sheet.
The Company’s most significant leases are those relating to its two manufacturing facilities along with a small office space.
All of the Company’s leases are operating leases and are included in other long-term assets with the corresponding liability in other long-term liabilities.

Fiscal 2020 first quarter net sales of $88,701,000 increased $3.7 million or 4.4% as compared to first quarter fiscal 2019.
Fiscal 2020 first quarter operating income of $6.9 million increased $4.0 million from operating income of $2.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The $4.0 million increase in operating income in fiscal 2019 was impacted by the sale of the Company’s New Windsor, New York facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 which favorably resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4.8 million.
Also contributing to the period-over-period change in operating income is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million with no comparable event in fiscal 2020.
Refer to the discussions in the “results of operations” for each of the Company’s reportable segments for further explanation of the period-over-period change in sales and operating income.
The Company believes it is appropriate to evaluate its performance after making adjustments to the as-reported U.S. GAAP operating income, net income, and earnings per share.
Lighting Segment net sales of $63,191,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 2.9% from fiscal 2019 same period net sales of $61,432,000.
Selling and administrative expenses of $8,060,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 decreased $3.6 million from the same period of fiscal 2019 selling and administrative expenses of $11,625,000, primarily due to the $4.8 million gain on the sale of the New Windsor, New York facility.
When the $4.8 million gain is removed from fiscal 2020 results, there was a $1.3 million or 11.1% increase in selling and administrative expenses.
The Lighting Segment first quarter fiscal 2019 operating income of $9,159,000 increased $5.3 million from operating income of $3,850,000 in the same period of fiscal 2019 primarily due to the $4.8million gain on the sale of its New Windsor, New York facility.
When the impact of $4.8 million gain is removed from fiscal 2020 results along with the restructuring and plant closure costs in both fiscal years, fiscal 2020 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income of $4,510,000 was $70,000 higher than fiscal 2019 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income of $4,440,000.
