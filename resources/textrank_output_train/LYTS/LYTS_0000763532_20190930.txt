A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Significant changes to our accounting policies as a result of adopting ASU-2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and adopting ASU 2016-02, “Leases” in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, which are discussed below.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligations in its customer contracts or purchase orders.
Most of the Company’s products have a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer.
For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
The Company offers standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations.
The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties.
The Company also offers installation services.
The Company disaggregates the revenue from contracts with customers by the timing of revenue recognition because the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, and timing of our revenue and cash flows.
The Company’s contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, as such the Company applies the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred and have omitted disclosures on the amount of remaining performance obligations.
The Company’s accounts receivable balance represents the Company’s unconditional right to receive payment from its customers with contracts.
On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09.

Fiscal 2020 first quarter operating income of $6.9 million increased $4.0 million from operating income of $2.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The $4.0 million increase in operating income in fiscal 2019 was impacted by the sale of the Company’s New Windsor, New York facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 which favorably resulted in a pre-tax gain of $4.8 million.
Also contributing to the period-over-period change in operating income is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million with no comparable event in fiscal 2020.
When the impact of the sale of the New Windsor facility along with the other restructuring and plant closure costs are removed from the operating results along with the one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019, operating income period-over-period remained relatively flat.
Refer to the discussions in the “results of operations” for each of the Company’s reportable segments for further explanation of the period-over-period change in sales and operating income.
Selling and administrative expenses of $8,060,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 decreased $3.6 million from the same period of fiscal 2019 selling and administrative expenses of $11,625,000, primarily due to the $4.8 million gain on the sale of the New Windsor, New York facility.
When the $4.8 million gain is removed from fiscal 2020 results, there was a $1.3 million or 11.1% increase in selling and administrative expenses.
The increase in selling and administrative expenses is mostly driven by higher commission expense which is the result of increased sales volume and a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 with no comparable event in fiscal 2020.
The Lighting Segment first quarter fiscal 2019 operating income of $9,159,000 increased $5.3 million from operating income of $3,850,000 in the same period of fiscal 2019 primarily due to the $4.8million gain on the sale of its New Windsor, New York facility.
When the impact of $4.8 million gain is removed from fiscal 2020 results along with the restructuring and plant closure costs in both fiscal years, fiscal 2020 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income of $4,510,000 was $70,000 higher than fiscal 2019 Non-GAAP adjusted operating income of $4,440,000.
Graphics Segment net sales of $25,510,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $2.0 million or 8.4% from fiscal 2019 same period net sales of $23,525,000.
The Company reported $431,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $518,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
