A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation in its customer contracts or purchase orders.
Most of the Company’s products have a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer.
For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
The Company offers standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations.
The Company disaggregates the revenue from contracts with customers by the timing of revenue recognition because the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, and timing of our revenue and cash flows.
The Company’s contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, as such the Company applies the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred, and have omitted disclosures on the amount of remaining performance obligations.
The Company’s accounts receivable balance represents the Company’s unconditional right to receive payment from its customers with contracts.
On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09.
The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $591,000 on July 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, as described below.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Company has an implementation team tasked with reviewing our lease obligations and determining the impact of the new standard to its financial statements.

Fiscal 2019 third quarter net sales of $72,832,000 decreased $6.0 million or 8% as compared to third quarter fiscal 2018 net sales of $78,843,000.
Net sales were favorably influenced by increased net sales of the Graphics Segment (up $2.8 million or 16%) more than offset by decreased net sales of the Lighting Segment (down $8.8 million or 14%).
Fiscal 2019 first nine months net sales of $247,330,000 decreased $11.3 million or 4% as compared to first nine months fiscal 2018 net sales of $258,614,000.
Fiscal 2019 third quarter operating loss of $(2,273,000) represents a $3.0 million change from operating income of $0.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The $3.0 million change from operating income in fiscal 2018 to an operating loss in fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of decreased net sales and decreased gross profit offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses.
Fiscal 2019 first nine months operating loss of $(19,610,000) represents a $0.1 million increase in operating loss from an operating loss of $(19,524,000) in the nine months of fiscal 2018.
Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 of $3.2 million decreased $5.4 million from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $8.6 million.
The decrease in adjusted operating income was the result of decreased net sales and decreased gross profit offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses.
Also contributing to the period-over-period results is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million.

Selling and administrative expenses of $3,916,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $0.4 million or 10% from the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of an increase in outside service expense and bad debt expense.
The Company reported $579,000 net interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $400,000 net interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The change in interest expense from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is the result of higher interest rates on the Company’s line of credit.
The Company also recorded other expense of $183,000 in the third quarter related to net foreign currency transaction losses from transactions with its customers and suppliers through its Mexican subsidiary.
