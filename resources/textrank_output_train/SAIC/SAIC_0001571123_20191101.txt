As one of the largest pure-play technical service providers to the U.S. government, we serve markets of significant scale and opportunity.
We serve our customers through approximately 2,200 active contracts and task orders and employ more than 23,000 individuals who are led by an experienced executive team of proven industry leaders.
Our long history of serving the U.S. government has afforded us the ability to develop strong and longstanding relationships with some of the largest customers in the markets we serve.
In fiscal year 2019, we generated greater than 95% of our revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, including subcontracts on which we perform.
Appropriations measures passed in September 2018 and February 2019, when combined, provided full funding for the federal government through the end of government fiscal year (GFY) 2019.
These bills were funded at increased levels for defense and non-defense spending based on a bi-partisan agreement reached in February 2018 to lift caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), providing additional business opportunities for the Company.
GFY 2020 and GFY 2021 are the final two years of the BCA limits on discretionary spending, so enactment of this measure effectively ended the threat of sequestration going forward (there remain caps for additional years on certain mandatory spending accounts, but these have little to no effect on our business).
The U.S. government has increasingly relied on contracts that are subject to a competitive bidding process (including indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ), U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) schedules, and other multi-award contracts), which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure.
We believe our long-term, trusted customer relationships and deep technical expertise provide us with the sophistication to handle highly complex, mission-critical contracts.
Our ability to be competitive in the future will continue to be driven by our reputation for successful program execution, competitive cost structure, and efficiencies in assigning the right people, at the right time, in support of our contracts.
Through each contract's life cycle, program managers review performance and update contract performance estimates to reflect their understanding of the best information available.
