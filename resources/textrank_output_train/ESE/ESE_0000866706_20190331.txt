On October 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606).
We recorded a $4.2 million adjustment to increase retained earnings to reflect the cumulative impact of adopting this standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2019, primarily related to certain long-term contracts our Filtration and Technical Packaging segments have that converted to the cost-to-cost method for revenue recognition.
Revenue is recognized when control of the goods or services promised under the contract is transferred to the customer either at a point in time (e.g., upon delivery) or over time (e.g., as we perform under the contract).
We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights and payment terms of the parties are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer and represents the unit of accounting for revenue recognition.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the expected consideration, or the transaction price, is allocated to each performance obligation identified in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation.
Revenue is then recognized for the transaction price allocated to the performance obligation when control of the promised goods or services underlying the performance obligation is transferred.
The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of significant financing components based on the expectation that the period between when the Company transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.
Approximately 52% of the segment’s revenues (approximately 19% of consolidated revenues) are accounted for over time as the product does not have an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for costs incurred plus a reasonable margin or the inventory is owned by the customer.
The related contracts are primarily cost-plus or fixed price contracts related to the design, development and manufacture of complex fluid control products, quiet valves, manifolds, shock and vibration dampening, thermal insulation and systems primarily for the commercial aerospace and military (U.S. Government) markets.
The contracts may contain multiple products, which are capable of being distinct as the customer could benefit from each product on its own or together with other readily available resources.
Therefore, each product is distinct in context of the contract and will be accounted for as a separate performance obligation.
Contracts with the U.S. Government generally contain clauses that provide lien rights to work-in-process along with clauses that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work-in-process.
Due to the continuous transfer of control to the U.S. Government, we recognize revenue over the time that we perform under the contract.
Selecting the method to measure progress towards completion for the commercial and military contracts requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or service to be provided.
We generally use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress for our Filtration segment contracts the rate at which costs are incurred to fulfill a contract best depicts the transfer of control to the customer.
Under this measure, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation, and revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred based on an estimated profit margin.
Under the typical payment terms of our long term fixed price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based or progress payments.

In the second quarter of 2019, net sales of $193.9 million were $19.1 million, or 10.9%, higher than the $174.8 million in the second quarter of 2018.
In the first six months of 2019, net sales of $376.5 million were $28.2 million, or 8.1%, higher than the $348.3 million in the first six months of 2018.
The increase in net sales in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the second quarter of 2018 was due to a $13.7 million increase in the Filtration segment, a $2.2 million increase in the USG segment, a $2.1 million increase in the Test segment and a $1.2 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment.
The increase in net sales in the first six months of 2019 as compared to the first six months of 2018 was due to a $19.9 million increase in the Filtration segment, a $2.3 million increase in the USG segment, a $5.8 million increase in the Test segment and a $0.3 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment.
In the second quarter of 2019, net sales of $79.5 million were $13.7 million, or 20.8%, higher than the $65.8 million in the second quarter of 2018.
In the first six months of 2019, net sales of $145.7 million were $19.9 million, or 15.8%, higher than the $125.8 million in the first six months of 2018.
The increase in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 was mainly due to a $4.8 million increase in net sales at Crissair due to higher aerospace shipments, a $3.5 million increase in net sales at PTI due to higher aerospace assembly and element shipments, a $2.3 million increase in net sales at VACCO due to higher shipments of defense spares, a $1.8 million increase in net sales at Mayday due to higher aerospace shipments and a $1.3 million increase in net sales at Westland due to timing of shipments.
The increase in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 was primarily due to an $8.0 million increase in net sales at Crissair due to higher aerospace shipments, a $5.0 million increase in net sales at PTI due to higher aerospace assembly and element shipments, a $3.6 million increase in net sales at Westland due to timing of shipments on government programs and a $3.3 million increase in net sales at Mayday due to higher aerospace shipments.
In the second quarter of 2019, net sales of $42.9 million were $2.1 million, or 5.1%, higher than the $40.8 million in the second quarter of 2018.
In the first six months of 2019, net sales of $84.2 million were $5.9 million, or 7.5%, higher than the $78.3 million in the first six months of 2018.
The increase in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 was primarily due to higher sales from the segment’s U.S. operations due to the timing of test and measurement chamber projects.
In the first six months of 2019, net sales of $41.9 million were $0.2 million, or 0.6%, higher than the $41.7 million in the first six months of 2018.
