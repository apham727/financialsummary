In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value.
Life Sciences net sales increased by $25 million, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.
Life Sciences net sales increased by $51 million, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.
Lower segment net income of $33 million, $41 million and $24 million for the Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments, respectively.
The decreases in net income outlined above were slightly offset by higher net income for the Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments of $19 million and $11 million, respectively.
Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.21 per share when compared to the same period in 2018, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 34.7 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.
Life Sciences net sales increased by $25 million, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.
Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2019, when compared to the prior year.
Life Sciences net sales increased by $51 million, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.
Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, when compared to the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of sales by 2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $11 million, or 5%, and $25 million, or 3%, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year, driven by higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses.
As a percentage of sales, these expenses were similar when compared to the same periods last year.
In the third quarter ending September 30, 2019, equity in earnings of affiliated companies declined by $9 million primarily driven by lower sales volumes for some of our affiliates.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated income before income taxes in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.
For the three months ended September 30, 2019 comprehensive income decreased by $444 million when compared to the same period in 2018, due to lower net income of $288 million and $110 million of negative impacts from the change in foreign currency translation losses, driven primarily by the Korean won.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 comprehensive income increased by $71 million when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in net income of $154 million offset by $53 million related to the adoption of the new standard for reclassification of stranded tax effects in AOCI.
For the three months ended September 30, 2019, we generated core net income of $397 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to core net income generated in the three months ended September 30, 2018 of $476 million, or $0.51 per share.
The decrease of $79 million was due to lower net income across the Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments, partially offset by higher net income for the Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we generated core net income of $1,172 million, or $1.30 per share, compared to core net income generated in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $1,134 million, or $1.20 per share.
The increase of $38 million was due to increased core net income across most reportable segments.
Included in core net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 is net periodic pension expense in the amounts of $22 million and $64 million, respectively, and $13 million and $38 million respectively.
All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.” This group is primarily comprised of the results of the pharmaceutical technologies business, auto glass, new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates.
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $59 million in the three months ended September 30, 2019, driven by volume decreases and display glass price declines in the low single-digits.
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $82 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, with the increase in glass volume in the high-single digits in percentage terms more than offsetting moderate price declines.
Net income in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $33 million and increased by $11 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, driven by the changes in sales outlined above.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, net sales increased $135 million, or 4%, primarily due to increased sales of enterprise network products of $152 million offset by lower sales of $17 million for carrier products.
