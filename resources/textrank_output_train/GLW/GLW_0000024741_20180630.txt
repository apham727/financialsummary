In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value.
Net sales in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $2,747 million and $5,247 million, compared to $2,497 million and $4,872 million, respectively, in the same periods in 2017, driven by an increase in net sales in all segments.
The increase in both periods was led by the Optical Communications segment, which increased $141 million and $209 million, respectively, due to higher sales of carrier network products in North American and Europe, and an increase in sales of enterprise network products from growth in data centers.
Environmental Technologies segment sales increased $54 million and $101 million, respectively, driven by higher sales of all products.
Life Sciences sales increased by $24 million and $46 million, respectively, driven by higher sales across all product lines.
Net sales in the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments increased by $3 million and $6 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
These items include the release of a $28 million tax valuation reserve in the second quarter of 2018, combined with the absence of the tax impact related to the sale of investment securities and the write-off of a tax receivable due to settlement in the second quarter of 2017;  
·    A decrease of $47 million in equity earnings, driven largely by the absence of a $46 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2017 resulting from the modification of long-term sales agreements with a customer of HSG.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same periods in 2017.
We believe 2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and anticipate that segment net sales will reach approximately $11.3 billion, an increase from prior expectations of $11.0 billion.
In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase in the high-teen percentage range with organic growth improving by a low-teen percentage range with an additional $200 million from the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers.
We are increasing our expectation of sales growth to the mid-teen percentage range in our Environmental Technologies segment, driven by continued strength in automotive product sales, on-going improvements in the heavy-duty diesel market and from the commercial launch of gas-particulate filters.
Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $50 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, when compared to the prior year.
·    An increase of $46 million in the Life Sciences segment, driven by higher sales in North America, Europe and China.
Movements in foreign exchange rates impacted Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $137 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018, when compared to the prior year.
·    An increase of $13 million in corporate spending primarily related to new information technology platforms and outside legal fees.
·    An increase of $31 million in corporate spending primarily related to new information technology platforms and outside legal fees.
For the three months ended June 30, 2018, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $37 million, or 18%, when compared to the same period last year, driven by higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses.
As a percentage of sales, these expenses increased slightly when compared to the same period last year.
In the second quarter of June 30, 2018, equity in earnings of affiliated companies decreased by $6 million, driven largely by the absence of gains in other equity investments.
In the first half of 2018, equity in earnings of affiliated companies decreased by $47 million, driven largely by the absence of a $46 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2017 resulting from the modification of long-term sales agreements with a customer of HSG.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated income before income taxes in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same periods in 2017.
For the three months ended June 30, 2018 comprehensive income decreased by $154 million when compared to the same period in 2017, due to the negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses of $382 million, driven primarily by the Japanese yen and the Korean won, partially offset by an increase in net income of $299 million.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018 comprehensive (loss) income decreased by $1,044 million when compared to the same period in 2017, due to a decrease in net income of $376 million, the negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation gains and losses of $568 million, driven primarily by the Japanese yen and the Korean won, and a decrease in net unrealized gains of designated hedges of $62 million.
Included in core earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 is net periodic pension expense in the amounts of $13 million and $25 million, respectively, and $12 million and $25 million respectively.
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $3 million, and decreased by $34 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively.
LCD glass price declines essentially offset increased sales volume for the second quarter of 2018.
