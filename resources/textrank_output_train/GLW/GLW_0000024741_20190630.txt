As of June 30, 2019, Corning met its goal of returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and is on track to invest $11 billion for growth and extended leadership.
On June 14, 2019, Corning introduced its 2020-2023 Strategy and Growth Framework.
Net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $2,940 million and $5,752 million, compared to $2,747 million and $5,247 million, respectively, during the same periods in 2018.
Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased $67 million and $245 million, respectively.
Growth from multi-year hyperscale data center projects drove the increase in enterprise sales in both periods.
Sales in carrier networks were down in the three months and up in the six months ended June 30, 2019.
The acquisition of 3M’s Communication Markets Division (“CMD”), which took place during the second quarter of 2018, also contributed to sales growth.
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $68 million and $141 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, with volume increases in the mid-teens in percentage terms more than offsetting moderate price declines.
Life Sciences sales increased by $15 million and $26 million, respectively.
Higher costs of $33 million, primarily accelerated depreciation, within the Display Technologies segment.
Diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.69 per share when compared to the second quarter of 2018, driven by the decrease in net income described, offset by the repurchase of 35.8 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
The increases in net income outlined above were offset by other net charges and credits of $20 million, primarily driven by accelerated depreciation within the Display Technologies segment and other corporate charges.
Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.53 per share when compared to the first half of 2018, driven by the increase in net income described above, offset by the repurchase of 35.8 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.
We anticipate Corning’s display glass volume will grow by high-single digits driven by television screen size growth and the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in Hefei, China.
In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase by a low-to-mid-single digit percentage, including the impact of a full year of sales from the acquisition of CMD.
We anticipate a mid-single digit percentage growth in sales for the Life Sciences segment.
Movements in foreign exchange rates decreased Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $34 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019, when compared to the prior year.
An increase of $26 million in the Life Sciences segment.
Movements in foreign exchange rates decreased Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $59 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019, when compared to the prior year.
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, gross margin decreased by $7 million and 1% and increased by $137 million or 7%, respectively.

When compared to the first half of 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $98 million, or 11%, in the six months ended June 30, 2019.
