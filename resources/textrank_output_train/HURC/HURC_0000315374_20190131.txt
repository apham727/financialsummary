We also provide machine tool components, software options, control upgrades, accessories and replacement parts for our products, as well as customer service, training and applications support.
We record revenues based on a five-step model in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, guidance codified in ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” In accordance with ASC 606, we have defined contracts as agreements with our customers and distributors in the form of purchase orders, packing or shipping documents, invoices, and, periodically, verbal requests for components and accessories.
For each contract, we identify our performance obligations, which is delivering goods or services, determine the transaction price, allocate the contract transaction price to the performance obligations (when applicable), and recognize the revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
Depending upon geographic location, after shipment, a machine may be installed at the customer’s facilities by a distributor, independent contractor or by one of our service technicians.
For our five-axis machines that we install, we estimate the fair value of the installation performance obligation and defer the recognition of that revenue.
Service fees from maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized in earnings on a prorata basis over the term of the contract, and are generally sold on a stand-alone basis.
