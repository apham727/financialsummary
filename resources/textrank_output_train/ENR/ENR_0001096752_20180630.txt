The results of Jack Black for the post-acquisition period are included within the Company's results since the acquisition date.
The adoption of this guidance on a prospective basis as of October 1, 2017 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements or the related disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including requiring excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recognized as income tax benefits or expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings.
The Company adopted these provisions of the guidance prospectively in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
As a result, the Company recognized tax deficiencies of $0.7 through income taxes during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 rather than additional paid-in capital.
The tax deficiencies were recorded as an operating activity in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.These Non-GAAP measures are referred to as "adjusted" or "organic" and exclude items such as impairment charges, the disposition of the Playtex gloves business, the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Jack Black, L.L.C.

For the nine months ended June 30, 2018, the impact of acquisitions also includes October 2017 net sales and segment profit for Bulldog Skincare Holdings Limited (“Bulldog”), which was acquired in October 2016.
