The following table presents changes in net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, as compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal 2018, and provides a reconciliation of organic net sales to reported amounts.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2019, net sales were $546.7, a 10.1% decrease when compared with the prior year quarter.
Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Jack Black and currency movements, organic net sales decreased 8.9% driven by declines in Wet Shave, North America Sun and Skin Care and Feminine Care businesses, partly offset by Infant Care and International Sun and Skin Care businesses.
Organic net sales in both North America and Internationally declined 9%.
The decline in net sales was driven by North America Wet Shave, Sun and Skin Care and Feminine Care, driven by competitive pressure in key retailers and product launches in the prior year period, as well as declines in International, which were largely driven by expected lower Wet Shave net sales in Asia Pacific due to commercial distribution changes implemented in Japan that created a difficult comparison to the prior year.
For the first six months of fiscal 2019, net sales decreased 6.7%.
Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Jack Black, the Playtex gloves sale, and currency movements, organic net sales decreased 6.5% versus the prior year period.
From a geographic perspective, organic net sales in North America declined 8% while International decreased 4%.
The decline in organic net sales was primarily due to declines across all segments in North America and International Wet Shave, driven by competitive pressure in key retailers and anniversary of prior year product launches and promotions.
Gross profit was $250.9 during the second quarter of fiscal 2019, as compared to $301.1 in the prior year period.
