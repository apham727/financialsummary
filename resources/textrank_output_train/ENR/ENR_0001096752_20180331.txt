On March 1, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Jack Black, a luxury men's skincare products company based in the United States.
The results of Jack Black for the post-acquisition period are included within the Company's results for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018.
In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including requiring excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recognized as income tax benefits or expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings.
The standard requires cash flows from excess tax benefits and deficiencies, previously classified as a financing activity, to be classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
The Company adopted these provisions of the guidance prospectively in the first six months of fiscal 2018.
As a result, the Company recognized tax deficiencies of $0.6 through income taxes during the first six months of fiscal 2018 rather than additional paid-in capital.
The tax deficiencies were recorded as an operating activity in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows during the first six months of fiscal 2018.These Non-GAAP measures are referred to as "adjusted" or "organic" and exclude items such as the disposition of the Playtex gloves business, the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Jack Black, L.L.C.
•We analyze our net sales and segment profit on an organic basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods.
Organic net sales and segment profit exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency, acquisitions and dispositions.
This information is provided because these types of fluctuations can distort the underlying change in net sales and segment profit either positively or negatively.
For the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, the impact of acquisitions includes net sales and segment profit activity for Jack Black, which was acquired in March 2018.
For the six months ended March 31, 2018, the impact of acquisitions also includes October 2017 net sales and segment profit for Bulldog Skincare Holdings Limited (“Bulldog”), which was acquired in October 2016.
