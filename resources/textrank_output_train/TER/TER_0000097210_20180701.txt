The accompanying financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Teradynes Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 1, 2018, for the year ended December 31, 2017.
In accordance with ASC 606, Teradyne recognizes revenues, when or as control is transferred to a customer.
Teradyne determines performance obligations by assessing whether the products or services are distinct from the other elements of the contract.
Teradyne considers the amount stated on the face of the purchase order to be the transaction price.
Teradyne uses standalone transactions when available to value each performance obligation.
In order to determine the appropriate timing for revenue recognition, Teradyne first determines if the transaction meets any of three criteria for over time recognition.
If the transaction meets the criteria for over time recognition, Teradyne recognizes revenue as the good or service is delivered.
Teradyne uses input variables such as hours or months utilized or costs incurred to determine the amount of revenue to recognize in a given period.
For transactions that do not meet the criteria for over time recognition, Teradyne will recognize revenue at a point in time based on an assessment of the five criteria for transfer of control.
Teradyne has concluded that revenue should be recognized when shipped or delivered based on contractual terms.
Typically acceptance of Teradynes products and services is a formality as Teradyne delivers similar systems, instruments and robots to standard specifications.
For the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, Teradyne also recognized $3.6 million and $7.9 million, respectively, in revenue on leases of Teradyne systems, which are accounted for outside of ASC 606.The total purchase price for MiR was approximately $197 million, which included cash paid of approximately $146 million and $51 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of revenue and earnings targets through 2020.
The retrospective adoption of this standard decreased the three and six months ended July 2, 2017 income from operations by $2.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively, due to the removal of net actuarial pension gains and increased non-operating (income) expense by the same amount with no impact to net income.
The increase in System Test revenues of $33.0 million, or 89.9%, was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5 hard disk drive and system level testers.
The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $22.8 million, or 58.0%, was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms and the acquisition of MiR, completed in April of 2018.
The increase in Wireless Test revenues of $7.5 million, or 27.1%, was primarily due to higher demand for connectivity test systems.
Gross profit as a percent of revenue increased by 2.2 points, as a result of an increase related to product mix primarily in Semiconductor Test.
