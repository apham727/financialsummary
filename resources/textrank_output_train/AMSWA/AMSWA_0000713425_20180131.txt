The increase in license fee revenues was attributable to entering into several license fee agreements during the quarter in our SCM segment, due to an increase in general economic activity and higher overall business information technology spending from the US tax reform.
The primary reason for the increase in services and other revenues in the three months ended January 31, 2018 was an increase in implementation and cloud services in our SCM segment partially offset by a decrease in our IT consulting services due to decreased demand for IT temporary staff.
