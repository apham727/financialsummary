Allocation of certain research and development expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses are made to each segment on a percent of revenue basis.
The segment table located in Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements sets forth the Company’s results of operations (in thousands) including net sales, gross profit, and operating income for each of the Company’s five segments during the periods shown.
Net sales increased 11% for the 13-week period ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the year-ago quarter.
The outdoor, aviation, marine, and fitness segments collectively increased by 18%, contributing 80% of total revenue.
Fitness was the largest portion of our revenue mix at 23% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 22% in the first quarter of 2017.
Cost of goods sold increased 6% in absolute dollars compared to the prior year quarter.
The increase in revenues outpaced the increase in cost of goods sold, which resulted in a 190 basis point decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.
Advertising expense decreased 20% in absolute dollars compared to the year-ago quarter.
The overall decrease in absolute dollars was driven primarily by decreased cooperative advertising associated with customer mix and fitness media, partially offset by an increase in outdoor media.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased 15% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.
The absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to personnel costs and expenses from prior year acquisitions in the first quarter of 2018.
The marine segment increase as a percent of revenues was primarily due to expenses resulting from prior year acquisitions in the first quarter of 2018.
Research and development expense increased 16% primarily due to engineering personnel costs related to our wearable product offerings, aviation, and expenses resulting from prior year acquisitions within the marine segment.
