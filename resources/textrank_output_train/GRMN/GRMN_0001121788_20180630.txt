Net sales increased 8% for the 13-week period ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the year-ago quarter.
The outdoor, aviation, marine, and fitness segments collectively increased by 17%, contributing 80% of total revenue.
Auto segment revenue decreased 19% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction.
Outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation segment revenues increased 4%, 24%, 24%, and 23%, respectively, when compared to the year-ago quarter.
The current quarter marine segment increase was primarily driven by sales of the newly acquired Navionics business, in addition to sales growth across most product lines.
The fitness segment revenues increase was primarily driven by strong sales in advanced wearables and cycling products.
Outdoor and aviation segment revenue increases were driven by increased sales across most product lines within each segment.
Cost of goods sold increased 7% in absolute dollars compared to the prior year quarter.
The increase in revenues outpaced the increase in cost of goods sold, which resulted in a 30 basis point decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.
Advertising expense increased 4% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.
The total absolute dollar increase was driven primarily by increased cooperative advertising associated with higher sales.
Auto advertising expense, in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue, increased compared to the year-ago quarter primarily due to a refresh of point-of-sale displays.
Outdoor advertising expense decreased in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenues due to reduced media advertising spend.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased 14% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.
The absolute dollar increase in the second quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to personnel costs and expenses from recent acquisitions.
