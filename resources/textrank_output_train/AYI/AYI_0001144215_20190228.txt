For the first six months of fiscal 2019, we paid $24.9 million for property, plant, and equipment, primarily for new and enhanced information technology capabilities, equipment, tooling, and facility enhancements.
As of February 28, 2019, 1.2 million shares had been repurchased under this authorization,
of which 0.4 million shares were repurchased in fiscal 2019.
We believe that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months based on our cash on hand, current projections of cash flow from operations, and borrowing availability under financing arrangements.
We use available cash and cash flow from operations, borrowings on credit arrangements, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options to fund operations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions if any; to repurchase Company stock; and to pay dividends.Item 1a.Risk Factors
