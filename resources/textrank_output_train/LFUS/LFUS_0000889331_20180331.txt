Net sales for Electronics increased $110.6 million, or 72.0%, due to the acquisition of IXYS and U.S. Sensor and strong growth across all the business units and geographic regions.
Net sales for the Automotive segment increased $18.3 million, or 17.0% due to volume growth across all the segmentâ€™s business units and geographic regions.

The Company recognized net income of $36.0 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $38.9 million, or $1.69 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.
The decrease in net income reflects the impact of the acquisition and integration related costs of $39.5 million associated with the IXYS acquisition that were mostly offset by operating income increases across all three segments and foreign exchange gains.
Additionally, the per share results reflect an increase in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 1.5 million as a result of the shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition of IXYS.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $69.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $22.9 million for the three months ended April 1, 2017.
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities reflected higher earnings and favorable working capital management that more than offset higher payments related to acquisition and integration costs.

Net sales increased $132.4 million, or 46.4%, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 with increases of $86.3 million and $3.1 million resulting from incremental net sales related to the IXYS and U.S Sensor acquisitions, respectively.
Total operating expenses were $112.1 million, or 26.8% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $64.8 million, or 22.7% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2017.
The increase in operating expenses of $47.3 million is primarily due to incremental operating expenses related to the IXYS and US Sensor acquisitions as well as higher acquisition-related and integration costs of $20.1 million and an increase in amortization expense of $6.1 million resulting from the acquisition of IXYS.
Operating income was $37.6 million, a decrease of $11.3 million or 23.1% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $48.9 million for the first quarter of 2017.
The decrease in operating income is primarily due to the purchase accounting inventory charges of $17.9 million along with the costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the IXYS acquisition as described above.
Income before income taxes was $44.6 million, or 10.7% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $47.4 million, or 16.6% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2017.
In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income, income before income taxes was impacted by favorable comparative foreign exchange gains that were partially offset by increased interest expense associated with the increased borrowings for the IXYS acquisition.
The effect of foreign exchange rate changes on various foreign currency transactions worldwide was approximately $10.6 million of unrealized income for the first quarter of 2018 compared to income of unrealized $1.6 million for the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to fluctuations in the euro and Philippine peso against the U.S. dollar.
Interest expense increased $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 primarily reflecting increased borrowings.
Additionally, other income increased by $1.9 million as a result of unrealized investment gains, primarily associated with our investment in Polytronics.
Net sales in the Americas increased $40.7 million, or 41.5%, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 driven by incremental sales from IXYS and U.S. Sensor acquisitions and increased volume across all businesses in the Electronics, Automotive and Industrial segments.
European net sales increased $40.9 million, or 69.4%, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.
The increase in net sales was primarily due to incremental sales from the IXYS acquisition and higher volumes across all businesses in the Electronics and Automotive segments and the relay business in the Industrial segment as well as favorable foreign currency effects of $9.5 million.
