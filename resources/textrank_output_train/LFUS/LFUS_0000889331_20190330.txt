The decrease was primarily driven by $9.9 million or 2.4% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and decreased volume in the passenger car and automotive sensors businesses within the Automotive segment, partially offset by higher volumes in the semiconductor business in the Electronics segment as result of the IXYS acquisition completed on January 17, 2018.

The increase in net income reflects lower non-segment charges compared to prior year primarily due to the IXYS acquisition, partially offset by lower operating income across all segments and foreign exchange losses.

Net sales decreased $12.3 million or 2.9% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to $9.9 million or 2.4% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, lower volume in the automotive sensors and passenger car businesses within the Automotive segment, partially offset by higher sales in the semiconductor business driven by the IXYS acquisition.
Operating income was $60.7 million, an increase of $23.1 million, or 61.5%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $37.6 million for the first quarter of 2018.

Income before income taxes was $46.4 million, or 11.5% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $44.6 million, or 10.7% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018.
In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before taxes was impacted by foreign exchange losses of $4.2 million during the three months ended March 30, 2019 compared to foreign exchange gains of $10.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018, impairment charges of $2.8 million for certain other investments and a $2.6 million loss on the disposal of a business within the Electronics segment.
Net sales increased $1.0 million, or 0.4%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to $10.2 million increase in the semiconductor business due to the IXYS acquisition completed on January 17, 2018, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impact of $5.3 million and lower electronics products volume.
Net sales decreased slightly by $0.6 million, or 2.4%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to the exit of the Custom business during the second quarter of 2018 and unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $0.2 million, partially offset by higher volume across the power fuse and relay businesses.
Net sales decreased $5.1 million, or 5.1%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
The decrease in net sales was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency effects of $7.0 million, partially offset by higher volume in the commercial vehicles and automotive sensors businesses within the Automotive segment and higher volume in the semiconductor business within the Electronics segment.
