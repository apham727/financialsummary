Revenues from arrangements which include financing are allocated considering relative standalone selling prices of lease and non-lease components within the agreement.

Royalty revenue is sales-based and recognized on date of subsequent sale of the product, which occurs on the date of customer shipment.
Revenue from extended warranty contracts is recognized evenly over the period of the warranty.
Multicomputer repair services revenue is recognized upon control transfer when the customer takes possession of the computer at time of shipping.

Post contract maintenance and support is considered immaterial in the context of the contract and therefore is not a separate performance obligation.
