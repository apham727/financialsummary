In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
The new standard is effective for the Company on October 1, 2018, and it does not plan to early adopt this ASU.
While this assessment continues, we have not yet completed our determination of the impacts of the standard or the effect of these impacts on our consolidated financial statements.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, except for inventory measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method.
This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and requires prospective application, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
The Company has not yet assessed the potential impact of implementing this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.

Our revenues decreased by approximately $3.3 million, or 13%, to $22.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $25.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The decrease in revenue is the result of a decrease of $1.7 million in our TS segment, combined with a $1.6 million decrease in our HPP segment.
Operating income decreased by approximately $1.3 million from operating income of $622 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to an operating loss of $723 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily as a result of a $765 thousand decrease in gross profit combined with an increase of $580 thousand in operating expenses.
The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of higher variable compensation costs and increased costs for sales and engineering hires in our U.S division of the TS segment and increased engineering costs in our HPP segment.
Our income tax expense decreased by approximately $339 thousand resulting in an income tax benefit of $128 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to an income tax expense of $211 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

The decrease in TS segment product revenues of $3.0 million during the period was primarily the result of a decrease in product revenues of $1.4 million in our U.K. division, combined with decreases of $1.2 million and $0.4 million in our German and U.S divisions, respectively.
The $1.4 million decrease in the U.K. division product revenues was primarily the result of decreased product shipments to a major customer.

The increase in TS segment service revenues for the period ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the prior fiscal year three month period was due primarily to an increase of $1.2 million in our U.S. division.
The $2.3 million decrease in revenue to Europe is primarily the result of decreased sales by our TS segment U.K. division of $1.3 million to a U.S. division multi-national customer, combined with decreased sales by our TS segment German division of $1.0 million.
The 0.6 million decrease in revenue to Asia is primarily the result of decreased multicomputer product sales by our HPP segment to a major customer as the result of a large one time order in the three months ended March 31, 2017.
