Finished goods includes inventory that has been shipped, but for which all revenue recognition criteria has not been met, of approximately $0.1 million and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
SAB 118 provides for a measurement period beginning in the reporting period that includes the Act’s enactment date and ending when the Company has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information needed in order to complete the accounting requirements but in no circumstances should the measurement period extend beyond one year from the enactment date.
During the first quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized a provision for income taxes of $1.1 million that includes a provisional estimate in the amount of $649 thousand related to the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings.
The following table lists customers from which the Company derived revenues in excess of 10% of total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and 2016.
In addition, accounts receivable from Customer A totaled approximately $1.0 million, or 5%, and approximately $2.4 million, or 9%, of total consolidated accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
Accounts receivable from Customer B totaled approximately $3.3 million, or 16%, and approximately $3.9 million, or 14%, of total consolidated accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
Accounts receivable from customer D totaled approximately $2.3 million, or 11%, of consolidated accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017.
No other customers accounted for 10% or more of total consolidated accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017.
Effective September 30, 2017, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
The amendments in this Topic are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
Beginning October 1, 2017, the Company adopted the ASU and it hasn’t had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
As a result of the adoption of this ASU, the Company reclassified the current deferred tax asset previously reported on the September 30, 2017 balance sheet to the noncurrent deferred tax asset.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. Additionally, the amendments eliminate the guidance in Topic 718 that was indefinitely deferred shortly after the issuance of FASB Statement No. This should not result in a change in practice because the guidance that is being superseded was never effective.
The Company has adopted this ASU effective October 1, 2017 and it hasn’t had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.

Our revenues increased by approximately $2.1 million, or 10%, to $22.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $19.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.
The increase in revenue is the result of an increase of $2.4 million in our TS segment, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in our HPP segment.
Our gross margin percentage increased overall, from 22% of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2016, to 23% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 due in part to an increase in higher margin TS segment service revenues.
Operating income increased by $0.1 million from an operating loss of $102 thousand for the three month period ended December 31, 2016 to operating income of $7 thousand for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a $681 thousand increase in gross profit partially offset by an increase of $572 thousand in higher operating expenses.
Our income tax expense increased by approximately $1.1 million to $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to an income tax benefit of $15 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2016.
The increase to the income tax expense was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017.
Our revenues increased by approximately $2.1 million to $22.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $19.9 million of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2016.
The TS segment revenues increase of $2.4 million was partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in our HPP segment.
The increase in TS segment product revenues of $0.9 million during the period was primarily the result of an increase in product revenues of $1.8 million in our U.K. division, partially offset by decreases of $0.8 million and $0.1 million in our U.S and German divisions, respectively.
The $1.8 million increase in the U.K. segment product revenues was primarily the result of increased product shipments to a major customer.
The increase in TS segment service revenues of $1.4 million during the period was primarily the result of increases of $1.0 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million of our U.S., German and U.K. The $2.1 million increase in revenues is primarily attributed to increased revenues by our TS segment.
