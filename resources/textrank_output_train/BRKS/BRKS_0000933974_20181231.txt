Net foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses totaled $0.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively, during the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs.
The new guidance introduces a new "expected loss" impairment model which applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities and other financial assets.
The Company expects to adopt the guidance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial position and results of operations.
For finance leases, interest on a lease liability should be recognized separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset, while for operating leases, total lease costs are recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company adopted this standard effective October 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method and has only applied this method to contracts that were not completed as of the effective date and all new contracts initiated on or after the effective date.
Upon adoption the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $0.9 million, net of tax adjustment of $0.4 million, which resulted in an increase to the opening accumulated deficit balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily driven by deferral of previously recognized revenue within the Brooks Life Sciences segment, offset by deferral of previously recognized commission expense within the Brooks Life Sciences segment and acceleration of revenue within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment.
As a result, upon adopting the standard the Company deferred previously recognized registration fee revenue for contracts not completed as of the effective date.
These changes, which resulted in a cumulative decrease to accumulated deficit of $0.2 million as of October 1, 2018, were driven by the identification of additional performance obligations as well as changes in the transfer of control of certain performance obligations across both the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group and Brooks Life Science segments.
The additional changes to the Company’s accumulated deficit included a cumulative decrease to accumulated deficit of $0.2 million from discontinued operations.
For further information with regard to the Company’s significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 2 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
On August 27, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its semiconductor cryogenics business to Edwards Vacuum LLC (a member of the Atlas Copco Group) for $675.0 million in cash.
The semiconductor cryogenics business consists of the CTI pump business, Polycold chiller business, the related services business and the Company's 50% share in Ulvac Cryogenics, Inc., a joint venture based in Japan.
The semiconductor cryogenics business was originally acquired by the Company in its 2005 merger with Helix Technology Corporation and is included in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment as part of the segment.
The transition service agreement outlines the information technology, people, and facility support the Company expects to provide to Edwards for a period up to 9 months after transaction closing date.
The supply agreement allows the Company to purchase CTI and Polycold goods at cost from Edwards up to an aggregate amount equal to $1.0 million during the one-year term after closing of the Disposition.
This Disposition is consistent with the Company’s long-standing strategy to increase shareholder value by accelerating the growth of its Life Sciences business with further acquisitions and strengthening its semiconductor automation business with opportunistic acquisitions.
The Company has concluded that there is no impairment indicator related to the goodwill of the Disposition group at either date the impairment analysis was performed.
The Company invests in marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale and records them at fair value in the Company’s unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets.

This section provides an analysis of our financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017.
In the life sciences sample-based services market, we utilize our core competencies and capabilities in automation and cryogenics to provide comprehensive bio-sample management solutions to a broad range of end markets within the life sciences industry.
Over the past several years, we have acquired and developed essential capabilities required to strategically address the sample management needs across multiple end markets within the life sciences industry.
Cash Flows and Liquidity- Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $138.3 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $251.2 million at September 30, 2018.
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $112.9 million was primarily attributable to net cash outflows of $445.2 million to acquire GENEWIZ, cash dividends paid of $7.2 million and capital expenditures of $3.6 million, partially offset by cash inflows from proceeds received from the amendment to our existing term loan of $340.5 million, proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $51.5 million and net cash inflows from operating activities of $6.3 million.
The $6.3 million of cash generated from operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 was comprised primarily of earnings of $21.5 million, including net income of $14.4 million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $7.1 million, partially offset by uses of cash of $15.2 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions.
Please refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below for a detailed discussion of our liquidity and changes in cash flows for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.
We reported revenue of $179.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, compared to $142.6 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $36.8 million, or 26%.
