In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its semiconductor cryogenics business to Edwards Vacuum LLC (a member of the Atlas Copco Group), (the “Disposition”).
The Company determined that the semiconductor cryogenics business met the “held for sale” criteria and the “discontinued operations” criteria in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Boards (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205, Presentation of Financial Statements, (“FASB ASC 205”) as of September 30, 2018.
The Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements were restated for all periods presented to reflect the discontinuation of the semiconductor cryogenics business, in accordance with FASB ASC 205.
The discussion in the notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements, unless otherwise noted, relate solely to the Company's continuing operations.
On July 1, 2019, the Company completed the Disposition for $675.0 million, subject to adjustments for working capital and other items.
The Company expects net cash proceeds from the sale to be approximately $550 million, after adjustments and deducting taxes and other items.
As of September 30, 2018, the Company has revised its accounts payable balance on a continuing operations basis to exclude accounts payable related to the semiconductor cryogenics business and revised its current liabilities held for sale balance to include accounts payable related to the semiconductor cryogenics business on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of September 30, 2018, the accounts payable balance related to the semiconductor cryogenics business was $11.1 million.
The Company will also revise these balances in previously reported historical periods in the event those periods are presented in future filings.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company identified a misclassification related to the presentation of the product and service revenue and the cost of product and service revenue related to the GENEWIZ Group (“GENEWIZ”) in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 31, 2018.
The total revenue and cost of revenue related to GENEWIZ for the three months ended December 31, 2018 were included in the product revenue and cost of product revenue line items instead of the service revenue and cost of 
Foreign currency exchange losses generated from the settlement and remeasurement of these transactions are recognized in earnings and presented within “Other expenses, net” in the Company’s unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Net foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses totaled $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 and $1.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
As of June 30, 2019, the Company had no assets or liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs.
ASU 2019-05 amends ASU 2016-13 to allow companies to irrevocably elect, upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, the fair value option on financial instruments that were previously recorded at amortized cost and are within the scope of ASC 326-20 if the instruments are eligible for the fair value option under ASC 825-10.
ASU 2019-05’s amendments should be applied “on a modified-retrospective basis by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the statement of financial position as of the date that an entity adopted the amendments in ASU 2016-13.” Certain disclosures are required.
The ASU clarifies that companies are exempt from making the interim period transition disclosures required by ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, for the period in which a change in accounting principle is made as a result of adopting ASC 842.
This interim period disclosure exemption is consistent with ASC 842, which already allowed companies to exclude the annual effect of the accounting change on income from continuing operations, net income and per-share amounts for periods post-adoption.
The new guidance introduces a new "expected loss" impairment model which applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities and other financial assets.
Entities are required to estimate expected credit losses over the life of financial assets and record an allowance against the assets’ amortized cost basis to present them at the amount expected to be collected.
