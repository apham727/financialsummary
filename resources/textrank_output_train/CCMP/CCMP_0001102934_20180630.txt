Cabot Microelectronics Corporation ("Cabot Microelectronics'', "the Company'', "us'', "we'', or "our'') supplies high-performance polishing slurries and pads used in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuit (IC) devices within the semiconductor industry, in a process called chemical mechanical planarization (CMP).
For additional information, refer to Part 1, Item 1, "Business", in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by Cabot Microelectronics pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).
In the opinion of management, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of Cabot Microelectronics' financial position as of June 30, 2018, cash flows for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, and results of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017.
The Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2017 were derived from audited financial statements.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Cabot Microelectronics and its subsidiaries.
The accounting estimates that require management's most difficult and subjective judgments include, but are not limited to, those estimates related to bad debt expense, inventory valuation, valuation and classification of auction rate securities, impairment of long-lived assets and investments, business combinations, goodwill, other intangible assets, interest rate swaps, share-based compensation, income taxes and contingencies.
The adjustments, relating primarily to accumulated earnings taxes of a foreign operation, increased the income tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 by $2,071.
These assets were classified as available-for-sale securities and were recorded at fair value.
We have presented these securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2018 as a current asset due to management's intent to use these funds for current business requirements.
Unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, are recorded within other comprehensive income.
Cash flows from purchases, sales and maturities of these securities are presented as investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") established a three-level hierarchy for disclosure based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair value.
Level 1 inputs consist of valuations based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
The following table presents financial instruments, other than long-term debt, that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017.
We have classified the following assets and liabilities in accordance with the fair value hierarchy set forth in the applicable standards.

Revenue for our third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $150.4 million, which represented an increase of 17.6% from the third quarter of fiscal 2017, with revenue in dielectrics slurries, polishing pads and tungsten slurries increasing 21.0%, 18.9% and 17.5%, respectively, from the same quarter last year.
Gross margin, representing gross profit as a percentage of revenue, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 53.6%, compared to 48.9% for our third quarter of fiscal 2017, both periods of which included 90-basis points of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense.
Gross margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was 53.0% of revenue, compared to 49.7% during the same period last year, which includes 90 and 100-basis points of adverse impact of NexPlanar amortization expense, comparatively.
We currently expect our gross margin for the full fiscal year 2018 to be at the high end of our revised guidance range of 52% to 53%, including NexPlanar amortization expense; this is an increase from our prior full year guidance range of 51% to 53%.
Operating expenses were $38.8 million in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $35.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, both periods of which included $0.5 million in NexPlanar amortization expense.
Operating expenses were $113.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to $105.1 million during the same period of fiscal 2017, which include $1.4 million of NexPlanar amortization expense for both periods.

While we are not involved in any legal proceedings that we believe will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, we periodically become a party to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.
We do not believe there have been any material changes in our risk factors since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
Furthermore, competitive dynamics within the semiconductor industry may impact our business.
For instance, we could experience negative impacts on cash flows due to the inability of our customers to pay their obligations to us, or our production process could be harmed if our suppliers cannot fulfill their obligations to us.
