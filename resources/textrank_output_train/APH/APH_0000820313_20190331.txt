Prior to adoption, the Company evaluated Topic 842, including the initial review of any necessary changes to existing processes and systems that would be required to implement this standard, in order to determine its impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
The Company recognized ROU assets and related lease liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2019 of approximately $180 related to our operating lease commitments, and there was no cumulative impact on retained earnings as of January 1, 2019.
Going forward, the impact of Topic 842 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements will be dependent upon the Company’s lease portfolio.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, less than 5% of our net sales are recognized over time, as the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination.
Since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations, contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were not significant as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
While the Company typically offers standard product warranty coverage which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment, the Company’s warranty liabilities and related warranty expense have not been and were not material in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, and for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those for the Company as a whole and are described herein and in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s 2018 Annual Report.
The Company evaluates the performance of business units on, among other things, profit or loss from operations before interest, headquarters’ expense allocations, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, amortization related to certain intangible assets and nonrecurring gains and losses.
Earnings per share is determined after the impact of the noncontrolling interests’ share in net income of the Company.
