As a result of the adoption of ASC 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," Cognex Corporation (the "Company") has provided disclosures related to revenue recognition in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The Company identifies performance obligations as promises in contracts to transfer distinct goods or services.
Standard products and services that the Company regularly sells separately are accounted for as distinct performance obligations.
Shipping and handling activities for which the Company is responsible under the terms and conditions of the sale are not accounted for as performance obligations but as fulfillment costs.
These activities are required to fulfill the Company’s promise to transfer the goods and are expensed when revenue is recognized.
The Company determines the transaction price as the amount of consideration it expects to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to the customer.
The Company includes estimated variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved.
The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation at contract inception based on a relative stand-alone selling price basis, or the price at which the Company would sell the good or service separately to similar customers in similar circumstances.
The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers the promised goods or services to the customer.
Revenue for application-specific customer solutions is recognized at the point in time when the solution is validated, which is the point in time when the Company can objectively determine that the agreed-upon specifications in the contract have been met and the customer will accept the performance obligations in the arrangement.
If the Company can objectively determine that control of a good or service has been transferred to the customer in accordance with the agreed-upon specifications in the contract, then customer acceptance is a formality.
For the Company’s standard products and services, revenue recognition and billing typically occur at the same time.
Such judgments include, but are not limited to, assessing the customer’s ability and intention to pay substantially all of the contract consideration when due, determining when two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract, determining whether a contract modification has occurred, assessing whether promises are immaterial in the context of the contract, determining whether material promises in a contract represent distinct performance obligations, estimating the transaction price for a contract that contains variable consideration, determining the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation, determining whether control is transferred over time or at a point in time for performance obligations, and assessing whether formal customer acceptance provisions are substantive.
In July 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2018-11 to amend ASU 2016-02 and provided an additional (and optional) transition method to adopt the new lease standard.
This transition method allows entities to apply the new lease standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption instead of using the original modified retrospective transition method of adoption which required the restatement of all prior period financial statements.
ASU 2016-13 applies to all reporting entities holding financial assets that are not accounted for at fair value through net income (debt securities).
The amendments in this ASU eliminate the probable initial recognition threshold to recognize a credit loss under current GAAP and, instead, reflect an entity’s current estimate of all expected credit losses.
The amendments in this ASU require that credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down and an entity will be able to record reversals of credit losses in current period net income.
ASU 2017-08 applies to all reporting entities that hold investments in callable debt securities that have an amortized cost basis in excess of the amount that is repayable by the issuer at the earliest call date (that is, at a premium).

In addition to product revenue derived from the sale of machine vision products, the Company also generates revenue by providing maintenance and support, consulting, and training services to its customers; however, service revenue accounted for less than 10% of total revenue for all periods presented.
The Company’s customers are predominantly in the factory automation market.
Customers in the consumer electronics and automotive industries contribute the largest percentage to the Company's factory automation revenue.
A small percentage of the Company’s customers are in the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment market.
The gross margin improved to 75% of revenue in the third quarter of 2018 from 74% of revenue in the third quarter of 2017, due primarily to a lower percentage of revenue related to application-specific customer solutions.
Revenue decreased by $33,821,000, or 13%, for the three-month period and increased by $29,891,000, or 5%, for the nine-month period.
Revenue for both periods in 2018 was impacted by lower sales in the consumer electronics industry primarily due to significantly lower revenue from large customers in OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display and smartphone manufacturing following a high level of investment from these customers in 2017.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on revenue for the three-month period, but accounted for approximately 3% of the revenue increase for the nine-month period, primarily related to the translation of Euro denominated and Chinese Yuan denominated revenue to U.S. Revenue from customers based in the Americas increased by 7% for the three-month period and by 22% for the nine-month period driven by strong sales in the logistics industry.
