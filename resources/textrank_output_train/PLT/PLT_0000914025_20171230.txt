Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on May 10, 2017 (the "Form 10-K"), each of which could materially affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations.
Changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results.
As rule making bodies and new legislation is enacted to interpret the Tax Act, these changes may adjust the estimates provided in this report.
The changes may possibly be material, due to, among other things, the Treasury Departmentâ€™s promulgation of regulations and guidance that interpret the Tax Act, corrective technical legislative amendments that may change the Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, or any updates or changes to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts, including impacts from changes to current year earnings estimates and foreign exchange rates of foreign subsidiaries.
As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted.
Given the unpredictability of these possible changes, it is difficult to assess whether the overall effect of these potential tax changes would be positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results.
