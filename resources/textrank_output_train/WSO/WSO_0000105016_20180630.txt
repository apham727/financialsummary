The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this report include the accounts of Watsco, all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of three joint ventures with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), in each of which Watsco maintains a controlling interest.
The results of operations for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2018.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued a standard on revenue recognition that provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers.
The adoption of this standard and its related amendments (collectively, the New Revenue Standard) on January 1, 2018 did not result in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings under the modified retrospective approach, nor did it have a significant impact on our consolidated net income, balance sheet or cash flow.
In May 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.
We elected to adopt this guidance during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
We will apply this guidance using a modified retrospective approach, and it will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
Based on our preliminary assessment of our lease portfolio, we expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.
However, we do not expect a material impact on our consolidated statements of income.
Our current minimum lease commitments are disclosed in Note 16 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted.
