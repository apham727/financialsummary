The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products.
New orders received in the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 were approximately $22.2 million as compared to $28.6 million of new orders received in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $12.2 million of orders comprising the March 31, 2019 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
The minimum of $12.2 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding opportunities representing approximately $58 million in the aggregate as of May 1, 2019 for both repeat and new programs.
A significant portion of the Company’s business is the production of military and industrial electronic equipment for use by the U.S. and foreign governments and certain industrial customers.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 47.2% and 50.6% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract.
Although shipments supporting the rail industry remain strong, the overall decline in power supply shipments in the current fiscal year relates primarily to the timing of shipments related to a specific military contract which had significant shipments in the prior fiscal year.
Gross profits for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $2,150,439 and $1,255,204, respectively.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, gross profits were $4,659,608 and $5,791,956, respectively.
The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production.
In the case of the latter, the Company can incur what it refers to as “loss contracts,” meaning engineering design contracts in which the Company invests with the objective of developing future product sales.
The gross profit percentage increased in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to an increase in sales while expenditures incurred during the period related to engineering design investments remained comparable to those incurred in the same period in 2018 offset, in part, by a slight overall decline in the gross profit percentage on product shipments.
The gross profit percentage decreased in the nine months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the increase in expenditures incurred related to engineering design investments primarily pertaining to a specific contract while sales for the period remained flat when compared to the same period in 2018.
This increase in spending on the specific engineering design contract reduced the gross profit percentage by 5.9% for the nine months ended March 31, 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,069,070 for the three months ended March 31, 2019; an increase of $173,941, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $3,374,301 for the nine months ended March 31, 2019; an increase of $617,982 compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 relates primarily to the increase in employee compensation costs associated with added program management personnel supporting the Company’s sales backlog and professional services.
Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was $45,254 and $56,112, respectively.
Other income for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was $174,686 and $140,797, respectively.
The decrease for the three months ended is primarily due to the reduction in investment securities offset, in part, by the gradual increase in the current yield percentages earned on the investment securities.
The increase in the nine months ended is primarily due an increase in interest income resulting from the gradual increase in current yield percentages earned on investment securities offset, in part, by a reduction in investment securities.
