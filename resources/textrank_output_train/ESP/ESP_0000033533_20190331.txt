New orders received in the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 were approximately $22.2 million as compared to $28.6 million of new orders received in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $12.2 million of orders comprising the March 31, 2019 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
The minimum of $12.2 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.

Net sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 increased to $24,858,649 as compared to $24,690,689 for the same period in 2018.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the increase in net sales is primarily due to an increase in magnetic sales consisting of certain engineering deliverables and product shipments on a specific long-term program, as well as, an increase in power supply shipments supporting the rail industry.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2019, the slight increase in net sales is primarily due to an increase in build to print sales for product which had no shipments in the prior fiscal year, an increase in magnetic sales for the reasons discussed above, offset, in part, by a decrease in power supply shipments.
Although shipments supporting the rail industry remain strong, the overall decline in power supply shipments in the current fiscal year relates primarily to the timing of shipments related to a specific military contract which had significant shipments in the prior fiscal year.
