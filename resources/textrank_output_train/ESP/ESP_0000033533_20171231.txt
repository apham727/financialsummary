The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products.
This expectation is driven primarily by orders already in the backlog and due to the commencement of shipments on a significant military contract from the Federal Government for a power supply we designed in-house and was qualified by the applicable government agency in the later part of fiscal year 2017.
New orders received in the six months of fiscal year 2018 were approximately $14.3 million as compared to $10.9 million of new orders received in the first six months of fiscal year 2017.
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $13.5 million of orders comprising the December 31, 2017 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.
Net sales to three significant customers represented 63.2% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 and net sales to two significant customers represented 38.4% of the Company's total sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 61.0% and 42.6% of the Company’s total sales for the six-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Historically, a small number of customers have accounted for a large percentage of the Company’s total sales in any given fiscal year.
Management continues to pursue opportunities with current and new customers with an overall objective of lowering the concentration of sales and mitigating excessive reliance upon a single major product of a particular program or minimizing the impact of the loss of a single significant customer.
Net sales increased for the three months ended December 31, 2017 to $11,531,105 as compared to $5,667,624 for the same period in 2016.
Net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2017 increased to $19,027,528 as compared to $11,736,308 for the same period in 2016.
For the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, the increase in net sales is primarily due to an increase in power supply sales resulting from the commencement of shipments on a new significant military contract in the current fiscal year.
For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, gross profits were $3,075,598 and $1,080,145, respectively.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 26.7% and 19.1%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
For the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, gross profits were $4,536,752 and $2,423,892, respectively.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 23.8% and 20.7%, for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
In the case of the latter, the Company can incur what it refers to as “loss contracts,” meaning engineering design contracts in which the Company invests with the objective of developing future product sales.
In any given accounting period the mix of product shipments between higher margin programs and less mature programs, and expenditures associated with loss contracts, has a significant impact on gross profit and net income.
The gross profit percentage increased in the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to product mix and a decrease in expenditures incurred related to engineering design investments.
