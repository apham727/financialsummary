The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products.
The principal methods of competition for electronic products of both a military and industrial nature include, among other factors, price, product performance, the experience of the particular company and history of its dealings in such products.
While recently, we have been experiencing some technical and schedule delays with our major development programs, these delays are being resolved as they arise and we do not currently expect any negative impact on our customer order fulfillment projections for fiscal year 2019.
New orders received in the first six months of fiscal year 2019 were approximately $13.4 million as compared to $14.3 million of new orders received in the first six months of fiscal 2018.
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $24.4 million of orders comprising the December 31, 2018 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding opportunities representing approximately $60.0 million in the aggregate as of January 31, 2019 for both repeat and new programs.
A significant portion of the Company’s business is the production of military and industrial electronic equipment for use by the U.S. and foreign governments and certain industrial customers.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 49.4% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2018 and net sales to three significant customers represented 63.2% of the Company's total sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 54.4% and 61.0% of the Company’s total sales for the six-month period ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
A loss of one of these customers or programs related to these customers could significantly impact the Company.
Historically, a small number of customers have accounted for a large percentage of the Company’s total sales in any given fiscal year.
We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract.
Inventoried work relating to contracts in process and work in process is valued at actual production cost, including factory overhead incurred to date.
Net sales decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2018 to $7,303,109 as compared to $11,531,105 for the same period in 2017.
Net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2018 decreased to $15,640,508 as compared to $19,027,528 for the same period in 2017.
For the three months ended December 31, 2018, the decline in net sales is primarily due to a decrease in power supply shipments on a specific military contract and a decrease in shipments supporting the rail industry.
For the six months ended December 31, 2018, the decrease in net sales is primarily due to the timing of power supply shipments related to a specific military contract which had significant shipments in the prior fiscal year, offset in part by an increase in build to print sales.
This decline in both periods is largely due to timing of shipments based on customer contractual delivery dates and shipments that have not been made due to engineering design changes required to meet customer requirements, certain supplier product non-conformances and an increase in lead times for certain electronic components due to industry shortages and volatility within the power electronics industry.
