The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products.
This expectation is driven primarily by orders already in the backlog and due to the commencement of shipments on a significant military contract from the Federal Government for a power supply we designed in-house and was qualified by the applicable government agency in the later part of fiscal year 2017.
New orders received in the nine months of fiscal year 2018 were approximately $28.6 million as compared to $16.8 million of new orders received in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017.
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $7.0 million of orders comprising the March 31, 2018 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 50.6% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 and net sales to two significant customers represented 40.7% of the Company's total sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 58.6% and 43.2% of the Company’s total sales for the nine-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Historically, a small number of customers have accounted for a large percentage of the Company’s total sales in any given fiscal year.
Management continues to pursue opportunities with current and new customers with an overall objective of lowering the concentration of sales and mitigating excessive reliance upon a single major product of a particular program or minimizing the impact of the loss of a single significant customer.
Percentage of completion accounting requires judgment relative to expected sales, estimating costs and making assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedules.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, gross profits were $1,255,204 and $1,128,505, respectively.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 22.2% and 21.2%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, gross profits were $5,791,956 and $3,552,397, respectively.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 23.5% and 20.8%, for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The primary factors in determining the change in gross profit and net income are overall sales levels and product mix.
The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production.
In the case of the latter, the Company can incur what it refers to as “loss contracts,” meaning engineering design contracts in which the Company invests with the objective of developing future product sales.
In any given accounting period the mix of product shipments between higher margin programs and less mature programs, and expenditures associated with loss contracts, has a significant impact on gross profit and net income.
The gross profit percentage increased in the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to product mix, offset in part, by an increase in expenditures incurred related to engineering design investments.
