These forward-looking statements represent the Company's current expectations or beliefs concerning future events.

The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products.
These risks include, without limitation, fluctuating requirements for power supplies in the rail industry, dependence on appropriations from the United States Government and the governments of foreign nations, program allocations, the potential of governmental termination of orders for convenience, and the general strength of the industry sectors in which our customers transact business.
Management expects revenues in fiscal year 2020 to approximate revenues during fiscal year 2019 and expects the gross profit margin to be higher in fiscal year 2020 than the gross profit margin during fiscal year 2019.
New orders received in the first three months of fiscal year 2020 were approximately $7.0 million as compared to $6.9 million of new orders received in the first three months of fiscal 2019.
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $29.2 million of orders comprising the September 30, 2019 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
The minimum of $29.2 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
The estimate of the September 30, 2019 backlog to be shipped in fiscal year 2020 is subject to future events, which may cause the amount of the backlog actually shipped to differ from such estimate.
In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding opportunities representing approximately $55 million in the aggregate as of November 5, 2019 for both repeat and new programs.
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will acquire any of the anticipated orders described above, many of which are subject to allocations of the United States defense spending and factors affecting the defense industry.
A significant portion of the Company’s business is the production of military and industrial electronic equipment for use by the U.S. and foreign governments and certain industrial customers.
Net sales to three significant customers represented 56.7% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2019.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 62.5% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018.
We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract.
Transaction prices on our contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) are typically based on estimated costs plus a reasonable profit margin.
The provision for losses on contracts is included in other accrued expenses on the Company’s balance sheet.
Gross profits for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $1,136,348 and $992,934, respectively.
The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production.
In the case of the latter, the Company can incur what it refers to as “loss contracts,” primarily on engineering design contracts in which the Company invests with the objective of developing future product sales.
The gross profit percentage increased in the three months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the decrease in incurred spending related to a specific engineering design contract when compared to the same period in 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,084,212 for the three months ended September 30, 2019; an increase of $74,668, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018.
The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in fiscal year 2019 relates primarily to the increase in expenditures for conferences and training, travel and board of director’s fees.
Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $47,489 and $76,070, respectively.
The decrease for the three months ended is primarily due to the reduction in investment securities offset, in part, by the gradual increase in the current yield percentages earned on the investment securities.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2018, the Company reported a benefit for income taxes resulting from a tax adjustment related to the exercise of stock options during the quarter.
