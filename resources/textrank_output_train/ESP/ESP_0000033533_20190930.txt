There is competition in all classes of products manufactured by the Company, ranging from divisions of the largest electronic companies, to many small companies.
The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products.
The principal methods of competition for electronic products of both a military and industrial nature include, among other factors, price, product performance, the experience of the particular company and history of its dealings in such products.
This expectation is driven primarily by orders already in our backlog that will be shipped in fiscal year 2020 with lower anticipated aggregate production costs than with the product mix shipped during fiscal 2019.
As factors such as engineering delays, competition and product costs impact gross profit margins, management will continue to evaluate our sales strategy, employment levels, and facility costs.
New orders received in the first three months of fiscal year 2020 were approximately $7.0 million as compared to $6.9 million of new orders received in the first three months of fiscal 2019.
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $29.2 million of orders comprising the September 30, 2019 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
The minimum of $29.2 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding opportunities representing approximately $55 million in the aggregate as of November 5, 2019 for both repeat and new programs.
A significant portion of the Company’s business is the production of military and industrial electronic equipment for use by the U.S. and foreign governments and certain industrial customers.
Net sales to three significant customers represented 56.7% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2019.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 62.5% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018.
Historically, a small number of customers have accounted for a large percentage of the Company’s total sales in any given fiscal year.
Management believes our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on our contracts.
We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations.
We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract.
Transaction prices on our contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) are typically based on estimated costs plus a reasonable profit margin.
Inventoried work relating to contracts in process and work in process is valued at actual production cost, including factory overhead incurred to date.
The provision for losses on contracts is included in other accrued expenses on the Company’s balance sheet.
