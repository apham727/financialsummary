On the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, Operating lease assets are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities are included in Other current liabilities and Operating lease liabilities.
At the lease commencement date, the Company records Operating lease liabilities based on the present value of the future lease payments.

Generally, for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, the Company has elected to not record a right-of-use asset and lease liability.
For equipment leases used in revenue generating activities, the Company will record a right-of-use asset and lease liability for leases with a term of 12 months or less.
