1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 



Overview of Business 



In 1989, we were formed and incorporated in California.
We maintain a majority-owned subsidiary in Mexico (since 1998) and two divisions in each of Taiwan (since 1997) and China (since 2005).
Our Mexico location closed all operations in May 2013 (final closure is pending sale of our local 15,000 sq.
Our China location also serves as the engineering design support center responsible for arranging pre-production scheduling and mass production runs with joint venture partners for our projects, making component datasheets and test specifications, preparing samples, monitoring quality of shipments and performing failure analysis reports.
Basis of Presentation 



The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all wholly owned divisions, including its 60% majority-owned subsidiary, Taitron Components Mexico, S.A. de C.V. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
Operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of financial results for the full year.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
New Accounting Pronouncements 



In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard on leasing.
The new standard will require companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also proposes a dual model for recognizing expense.
This guidance was effective in our first quarter of 2019.
In January 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses.
This guidance was effective in our first quarter of 2019.
In May 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
This guidance was effective in our first quarter of 2019.

Revenue recognition 



Revenue is recognized at the point at which control of the underlying products are transferred to the customer.
All revenue is generated from contracts with customers.
In determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to receive.
Based upon the nature of our contracts with customers and our performance obligations within those contracts, we have no contract assets or liabilities as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
Nature of products 



We are primarily a supplier of original designed and manufactured (ODM) products that include value-added engineering and turn-key solutions.
The following is a description of major products lines from which we generate our revenue: 



ODM Projects - Our custom made small devices for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and contract electronic manufacturers (CEMs) in their multi-year turn-key projects and marketed in specific industries such as: wild animal feeders, timers for DC motors, public street light controllers, and battery chargers.
ODM Components - Our private labeled electronic components.
Distribution Components - Our name brand electronic components.
