In our Performance Materials segment, we continue to record strong revenue this quarter, primarily driven by higher demand for our drag-reducing agents. These products enable pipeline operators to optimize the efficiency and throughput of oil transport in both U.S. and international oil production.
Revenue for our third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $271.9 million, which represented an increase of 80.7% from the same quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition.
Net income was $18.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, which represented a decrease of 46.3% from the same quarter of fiscal 2018. Results benefited from the Acquisition, but were more than offset by acquisition-related expenses, increased amortization and depreciation associated with re-valuing KMG assets to fair value, higher interest expenses resulting from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition, costs related to the KMG-Bernuth warehouse fire that occurred in May 2019, and increased tax expense related to newly issued final regulations related to US Tax Reform which impacted our reserves for uncertain tax positions. For the same reasons, diluted earnings per share decrease from $1.34 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to $0.64 in the current quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $85.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. This represents an increase of $36.9 million, or a 75.6% increase from the same quarter of fiscal 2018. Adjusted EBITDA benefited from the addition of the KMG businesses, partially offset by the softer industry conditions that resulted in lower demand for Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage CMP products. Refer to the “Use of certain GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Information” section below for the definition of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA margin, which represents adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, was 31.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to 32.5% for the same quarter of fiscal 2018.
Revenue was $271.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an 80.7%, or $121.4 million, increase from the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition. Revenue from Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses decreased by $10.1 million, or 6.7%, primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by a higher value product mix.
Total cost of sales was $156.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of 124.4%, or $86.8 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to the Acquisition. The cost of sales from Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses decreased by $3.8 million, primarily driven by lower sales volume.
Total research, development and technical expenses were $12.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a decrease of 6.6%, or $0.9 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower staffing-related costs of $1.1 million, including incentive compensation costs, offset by higher supplies used in research and development of $0.4 million.
Our research, development and technical efforts are focused on the areas of research related to fundamental CMP technology; development of new and enhanced CMP consumable products, including collaboration on joint development projects with technology-leading customers and suppliers; process development to support rapid and effective commercialization of new products; technical support of CMP products in our customers’ research, development and manufacturing facilities; and, development of polishing and metrology applications outside of the semiconductor industry.
Interest expense was $12.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of $12.2 million from the three months ended June 30, 2018. The increase resulted from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition.
Interest income was $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a decrease of 63.5%, or $0.7 million from the three months ended June 30, 2018 due to lower cash balances compared to the same period last year.
Other expense was $0.5 million for three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to other income of $0.5 million from the three months ended June 30, 2018. The change was primarily due to higher loss on foreign exchange in the current quarter and the absence of the gain on termination of interest rate swap agreements of $0.5 million that had occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The Company’s effective income tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 52.1%, compared to 18.3% in the same quarter last year. The increase is primarily driven by a discrete charge of $9,128 related to newly issued final regulations related to U.S. Tax Reform which impacted the Company’s reserves for uncertain tax positions. 
Net income was $18.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a decrease of 46.3%, or $16.3 million, from the three months ended June 30, 2018. Net income benefited from the addition of the KMG businesses, and was partially offset by acquisition and integration-related expenses, increased amortization and depreciation associated with re-valuing KMG assets to fair value, higher interest expenses resulting from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition, KMG-Bernuth warehouse fire related costs, and discrete charge of $9,128 related to newly issued final regulations related to U.S. Tax Reform which impacted the Company’s reserves for uncertain tax positions.
Revenue was $759.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a 75.1%, or $325.7 million increase from the nine months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the Acquisition. Revenue from Cabot Microelectronics’ heritage businesses increased slightly by $9.0 million, or 2.1%. This increase was primarily driven by a higher value product mix, selected price increases, partially offset by lower sales volume.
Total research, development and technical expenses were $39.0 million for nine months ended June 30, 2019, which was relatively flat compared to the same period last year. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $162.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of 116.4%, or $87.4 million, from the nine months ended June 30, 2018. The increase was primarily due to $33.1 million of acquisition and integration related costs, $32.5 million of amortization expense related to the Acquisition, and $27.1 million in incremental KMG-related costs associated with the post-Acquisition period during the nine months period. These items were partially offset by the absence of executive officer transition costs of $4.2 million that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Interest expense was $33.0 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented an increase of $30.2 million from the nine months ended June 30, 2018. The increase resulted from the debt borrowing to finance the Acquisition.
Interest income was $2.0 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which represented a decrease of 38.3%, or $1.2 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 due to lower cash balances.
Other expense was $2.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, compared to other income of $0.1 million from the nine months ended June 30, 2018. The change was primarily due to higher loss on foreign exchange, and the absence of the gain on sale of assets of $1.0 million and gain on the termination of interest rate swap agreements that occurred in the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
The $202.4 million increase in Electronic Materials revenue was driven by the addition of KMG’s electronic chemicals business since the Acquisition. The remaining increase was driven by higher value product mix, strong organic demand for the Company’s heritage CMP polishing pads product line, which increased 11.1%, primarily on higher sales volume, partially offset by the decrease in Company's heritage CMP slurries products due to the softer industry conditions. Electronic Materials adjusted EBITDA increased from the prior year driven by the addition of KMG’s electronic chemicals results, as well as stronger profitability, driven by the leverage achieved on higher sales volume of the Company’s heritage CMP polishing pads product line. The lower adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily due to change in mix of products as a result of the Acquisition.
The $123.3 million increase in Performance Materials revenue was primarily driven by the addition of KMG’s performance materials business post-Acquisition. Performance Materials’ adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from the prior year due to the addition of KMG’s heritage performance materials business.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for certain items that affect comparability from period to period. These adjustments include items related to our acquisition of KMG, such as expenses incurred to complete the acquisition, integration related expenses, and impact of fair value adjustments to inventory acquired from KMG.
Adjusted EBITDA for the Electronic Materials and Performance Materials segments is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, Segment Reporting. This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For these reasons, this measure is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the SEC Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K.
The table below presents the reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income. Adjusted EBITDA may have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
We generated $117.0 million in cash flows from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to $104.0 million in cash from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. The increase in operating cash flows of $13.0 million was due to an increase of net income adjusted for non-cash reconciling items.
In the first nine months of fiscal 2019, cash flows used in investing activities were $1.2 billion, compared to $145.3 million in cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. The increase was driven by the use of $1,182 million for the Acquisition. The remainder of the purchase price was satisfied with the issuance of common stock. Capital expenditures in the first nine months were $32.7 million, compared to $15.2 million in the prior year.
In the first nine months of fiscal 2019, cash flows provided by financing activities were $908.7 million, compared to $177.7 million used in financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we received $1,044 million in debt proceeds, net of $21.4 million in debt issuance costs and original issue discount fees, which was used for the Acquisition. In addition, our dividend payments increased by $13.6 million versus the prior year, driven by the doubling of our quarterly dividend, as announced in March 2018, and the new shares issued in connection with the Acquisition.
At June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.
We have been operating under a multi-year supply agreement with Cabot Corporation, which has not been a related party since 2002, for the purchase of fumed silica, the current term of which runs through December 31, 2019. Purchase obligations include an aggregate amount of $8.9 million of contractual commitments related to this agreement.
Interest payments on long-term debt reflect interest rates in effect at December 31, 2018. The interest payments reflect variable LIBOR-based rates currently in effect on $216.3 million of our outstanding debt, and fixed rates on $746 million of outstanding debt for which we have implemented an interest rate swap. Commitment fees are based on our estimated consolidated leverage ratio in future periods. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our long-term debt.
• Elimination of transaction costs incurred in connection with the Acquisition;
• Adjustments to reflect the new financing arrangements entered into and legacy financing arrangements retired in connection with the Acquisition;
• The exchange of 0.2000 share(s) of Cabot Microelectronics common stock for each share of KMG common stock; and
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the completion of the acquisition. We utilized estimated fair values at the Acquisition Date to allocate the total consideration exchanged to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This allocation was initially completed as of November 15, 2018. The allocation may be adjusted for up to one-year post closing.
The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Income to give effect to unaudited pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the transaction, (2) factually supportable and (3) are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of the combined company. As a result, under SEC Regulation S-X Article 11, certain non-recurring expenses such as deal costs and compensation expenses related to severance or accelerated stock compensation and certain non-cash costs related to the fair value step-up of inventory are eliminated from pro forma results in the periods presented. Certain recurring historical KMG expenses related to depreciation, amortization, financing costs and costs of sales have been adjusted as if the Acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2017. 
In contrast, under the ASC 805 presentation in Note 4, Business Combination, to the consolidated financial statements, these expenses are required to be included in prior year pro forma results.

1 Shares outstanding for KMG are from KMG's filed 10-Q for the nine months ended April 30, 2018. They are intended for illustrative purposes only and do not impact pro forma EPS calculations at right. Nine months ended June 30, 2018 KMG share calculations were not available.
3 Pro forma adjustments are related to items directly attributable to the transaction, such as recurring differences related to depreciation, amortization, compensation or financing costs that were included as if the companies were combined as of October 1, 2017.
We calculated the income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments using a 22.1% and 23.4% tax rate, which represent the weighted average statutory tax rate for nine-month period ended June 30, 2019 and year-ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
Additionally, for the 2018 periods presented, we calculated the unaudited pro forma weighted average number of basic shares outstanding by adding the Cabot Microelectronics weighted average number of basic shares outstanding from the share amounts disclosed in the historical Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the amount of shares issued in connection with the Acquisition, as if the shares were held for the entire period.
The basic and diluted EPS calculation takes pro forma net income divided by the applicable number of shares outstanding.
•Removal of amortization of acquisition related intangibles, since management believes that these costs are not indicative of the company’s core operating performance.
•Adjustment for U.S. Tax Reform, which represents a significant non-recurring item affecting comparability among periods.
•Removal of certain costs related to a warehouse fire at KMG-Bernuth.
Reconciliations for these items are provided in the tables below.
