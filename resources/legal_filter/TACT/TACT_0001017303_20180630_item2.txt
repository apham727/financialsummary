Net sales for the second quarter of 2018 increased $1.2 million, or 8%, from the same period in 2017. Printer and terminal sales volume increased 6% to approximately 39 thousand units driven primarily by an 81% increase in unit volume from the casino and gaming market and, to a lesser extent, a 14% increase in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market. These increases were partially offset by an 83% decline in unit volume from the lottery market. The average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 7% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2018 due primarily to lower lottery printer sales. 
International sales for the second quarter of 2018 increased $2.3 million, or 221%, from the same period in 2017 due primarily to a 267% increase in sales in the international casino and gaming market. 
The increase in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 was driven by the initial shipments of the AccuDate XL to two existing customers in support of large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal. This increase was partially offset by decreased sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our former U.S. distributor during the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017. Shipments of AccuDate XL terminals exceeded sales of AccuDate 9700 terminals for the first time in the second quarter of 2018. We expect sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to continue to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 as we benefit from the strategic selling and marketing investments implemented during 2017. 
The increase in both domestic and international POS automation and banking product revenue from the second quarter of 2017 was driven by an 21% increase in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald's have returned to the near record levels experienced during 2017. We expect this level of sales to McDonald's to continue into the third quarter of 2018. This increase was partially offset by 71% lower sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers for the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017. We expect sales of these legacy products to continue to decline during the second half of 2018, as expect to exit the banking market at the end of 2018 and have shifted our focus to our newer products. 
The increase in international sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 was due to a 366% increase in sales of our thermal casino printers and a 153% increase in sales of our off-premise gaming printers in Europe, Australia and Asia. These increases were due to the early success of the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor whose contract ended at the end of 2017. We expect international sales of both our thermal casino printers and off-premise gaming printers to continue to increase in the second half of 2018, as we benefit from the transition to selling directly to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe. 
The increase in sales of Printrex printers in the second quarter of 2018 compared to second quarter of 2017 resulted from a 84% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers. This increase was partially offset by 76% lower sales of our medical and mobile printers in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017. We expect Printrex sales for the full year of 2018 to be higher than 2017, as we expect a continued modest recovery in the global oil and gas industry to more than offset lower expected sales of medical and mobile printers as we shift our focus to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products. 
Internationally, TSG revenue increased due to a 98% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017. 
Selling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, sales commissions, travel expenses, expenses associated with the lease of sales offices, advertising, trade show expenses, e-commerce and other promotional marketing expenses. Such expenses increased by $45 thousand, or 2%, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 due primarily to the hiring of additional sales staff in the U.K. to support our new direct selling model for the casino and gaming market in Europe. This increase was partially offset by the retirement of our EVP, Sales and Marketing in December 2017, whose position was replaced by an existing employee of TransAct, as well as the elimination of commission expense to our former international casino and gaming distributor, Suzo-Happ. We expect selling and marketing expenses to be higher in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the build-out of our internal sales infrastructure to sell directly to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe during 2018. 
General and administrative expenses primarily include salaries, incentive compensation, and other payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resource and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company. General and administrative expenses increased $41 thousand, or 2%, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 due primarily to higher incentive compensation expenses and legal expenses incurred during 2018. We expect general and administrative expenses in 2018 to be higher than 2017 due to increased recruiting expenses related to the expansion our restaurant solutions sales staff, sales staff for our European casino and gaming market, and engineering staff. 
Our operating income increased $312 thousand, or 24%, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017, and our operating margin increased to 11% of net sales largely due to higher gross profit resulting from an 8% increase in sales, as well as proportionately lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year period. 
Interest expense. We recorded net interest expense of $6 thousand in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $8 thousand in the second quarter of 2017. We do not expect significant changes in net interest expense for the remainder of 2018. 
Net sales for the first half of 2018 decreased $599 thousand, or 2%, from the same period in 2017. Printer sales volume decreased by 12% to approximately 70,000 units in the first half of 2018 driven primarily by an 81% decrease in unit volume from the lottery market and, to a lesser extent, a 10% decrease in the POS automation and banking market. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales volume of 38% in the casino and gaming market and, to a lesser extent, a 32% increase in unit volume from the restaurant solutions market. Although unit volume decreased in the first six months of 2018 primarily due to the decreased volume of lottery printers sold during the first half of 2018, which carry lower prices than our other products, the average selling price of our printers increased 11% during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. 
International sales increased $920 thousand, or 20%, primarily driven by 65% higher international sales in the casino and gaming market. This increase was partially offset by a $1.1 million sales decrease in our international lottery market during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. 
The increase in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 was primarily driven by increased sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal during the first half of 2018 and the initial shipments of the AccuDate XL to two large corporate customers in support of a large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal. 
International restaurant solutions sales increased during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 due to increased sales of the AccuDate 9700 for McDonald's through our Asian distributor. 
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 was primarily driven by a 72% decrease in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers during the first half of 2018 as we continue to deemphasize these products. Sales also decreased during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 due to a 7% decline in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer due to lower sales to McDonald's in the first quarter of 2018, but which subsequently rebounded to prior year, near-record levels in the second quarter of 2018. 
International sales increased due to higher sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer to our Canadian distributor for McDonald's during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. 
The increase in international sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 was due to a 118% increase of thermal casino printer sales and, to a lesser extent, a 13% increase in international sales of off-premise gaming printers. These increases were due to the early success of the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor and using our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers in Europe. 
The decrease in international lottery sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 was due to a sale of lottery printers to IGT for the Canadian lottery in the first half of 2017 and no comparable sale occurring in the first half of 2018. 
The increase in domestic Printrex sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 resulted from higher domestic sales in the oil and gas market due to a continued recovery in the oil and gas market. This increase was partially offset by lower sales of domestic medical and mobile printers in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 as we shift our focus away from the medical and mobile markets to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products. 
The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG in the first half of 2018 as compared to the first half of 2017 was due primarily to decreased replacement part sales, service revenue and non-Printrex consumable product sales. Replacement part sales decreased 6% due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT. Service revenue declined 10% in the first half of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to paper testing sales that occurred in the 2017 period but did not repeat in the 2018 period. Non-Printrex consumables declined 6% due to lower sales of our legacy HP inkjet cartridges used in our banking printers, as we continue to deemphasize our sales of this commoditized consumable product and expect to exit the banking market at the end of 2018. The decrease in Non-Printrex consumables was partially offset by AccuDate label sales which more than quadrupled in the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017. 
Internationally, TSG revenue increased primarily due to a 57% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. 
Gross profit increased $330 thousand, or 3%, due primarily to a more favorable sales mix in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 as gross margin increased 220 basis points to 47.6% in the first half of 2018 compared to 45.4% in the same period 2017. The increased gross margin reflects a favorable shift in sales mix towards higher-value, technology driven solutions, as well as lower sales volume of lottery and POS printers, which carry lower margins than our other products. 
Engineering, design and product development expenses increased $391 thousand, or 19%, in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 due primarily to the hiring of additional engineering staff and increased expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.  
General and administrative expenses increased $241 thousand, or 6%, in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 due primarily to higher incentive compensation, severance and legal expenses incurred in the 2018 period.  
Our operating income decreased by $248 thousand, or 9%, during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 primarily due to a 2% decrease in sales and a 6% increase in operating expenses, somewhat offset by a 220 basis point increase in gross margin in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017.

In 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the Board's approval each quarter. Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017. Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $663 thousand, or $0.09 per share in both the second quarter of 2018 and second quarter of 2017. We expect to pay approximately $2.7 million in cash dividends to our common shareholders during the full year 2018. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, dividends declared and paid totaled $1.3 million, or $0.18 per share and $1.3 million, or $0.17 per share, respectively. 
On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the "2018 Stock Repurchase Program"). Under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors. The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue the repurchase program prior to such time. We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account. Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we repurchased 156,510 shares of our common stock for approximately $2.0 million at an average price per share of $12.78. During the six months ended June 30, 2107, we purchased no shares of our common stock. 
We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our expected cash flows generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our TD Bank Credit Facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and dividend payments and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months. 
The disclosure of payments we have committed to make under our contractual obligations is set forth under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.  
There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2017. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
