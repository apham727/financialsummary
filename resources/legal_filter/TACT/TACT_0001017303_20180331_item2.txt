Net sales for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $1.8 million, or 13%, from the same period in 2017. Printer and terminal sales volume decreased 28% to approximately 31 thousand units driven primarily by an 80% decrease in unit volume from the lottery market and a 29% decrease in unit volume in the POS automation and banking market. These decreases were partially offset by increases in unit volume of 6% from the casino and gaming market and 87% from the restaurant solutions market. The average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 15% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.  
International sales for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $1.4 million, or 41%, from the same period in 2017 primarily due to a decrease in sales in the international lottery market and to a lesser extent a 14% decrease in the international casino and gaming market.  
The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking product revenue in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by a 27% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald's slowed compared to the record pace experienced in 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. We expect sales to McDonald's to decrease for the full year 2018 compared to the full year 2017, as McDonald's completes the implementation of initiatives that use the Ithaca 9000, which began in 2015. Domestic sales also declined, although to a lesser extent, due to a 73% decrease in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 as we continue to deemphasize these products. We expect sales of these legacy products to continue to decline during 2018, as we have shifted our sales focus to our newer products. 
The increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due largely to a 19% increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printers in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, driven primarily by increased sales to our OEMs. Additionally, domestic EPICENTRAL™ software sales increased 233% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 as we completed one new installation in 2018 compared to no installations completed during the first quarter of 2017. Sales of EPICENTRALTM are project based and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. 
International casino and gaming product sales decreased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to a 32% decline in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to Europe, Australia and Asia. Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. International sales of our thermal casino printers increased 5% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. We expect international sales of both our thermal casino printers and off-premise gaming printers to increase in 2018 as we benefit from the transition away from our previous exclusive worldwide distributor whose contract ended at the end of 2017 and begin to sell directly to our slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe. 
The decrease in international lottery sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was due to a sale of lottery printers to IGT for the Canadian lottery in the first quarter of 2017 and no comparable sale occurring in the first quarter of 2018. 
The increase in sales of Printrex printers in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 resulted from 107% higher domestic sales in the oil and gas market. This increase was partially offset by lower sales in the international oil and gas market and lower sales of both domestic and international medical and mobile printers in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. We expect Printrex sales for the full year of 2018 to be higher than 2017, as we expect a continued modest recovery in the oil and gas market to more than offset lower expected sales of medical and mobile printers as we shift our focus to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solution and casino and gaming products. 
Internationally, revenue from TSG increased slightly in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to higher international replacement part sales. 
Gross profit is measured as revenue less cost of sales, which includes primarily the cost of all raw materials and component parts, direct labor, manufacturing overhead expenses, cost of finished products purchased directly from our contract manufacturers and expenses associated with installations of our EPICENTRALTM print system. In the first quarter of 2018, gross profit decreased $231 thousand, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2017 due to 13% lower sales, somewhat offset by higher gross margin. Although gross profit decreased, our gross margin increased 440 basis points, from 47.9% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 43.5% in the first quarter of 2017. The increased gross margin reflects a favorable shift in sales mix towards higher-value, technology driven solutions, as well as lower sales of the lottery and POS printers, which carry lower margins than our other products. 
Selling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, sales commissions, travel expenses, expenses associated with the lease of sales offices, advertising, trade show expenses, e-commerce and other promotional marketing expenses. Such expenses decreased by $99 thousand, or 6%, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to the retirement of our EVP, Sales and Marketing in December 2017, whose position was replaced by an existing employee of TransAct, as well as the elimination of commission expense to our former international casino and gaming distributor, Suzo-Happ. These decreases were partially offset by the hiring of additional sales staff to expand our casino and gaming sales to support our direct selling model and to replace our former distributor. We expect selling and marketing expenses to be higher in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the build-out of our internal sales infrastructure to sell directly to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe in 2018. 
General and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resource and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company. General and administrative expenses increased $200 thousand, or 10%, in first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due primarily to higher severance and incentive compensation expense incurred in the 2018 period. We expect general and administrative expenses in 2018 to be higher than 2017 due to increased recruiting expenses as we continue to expand our restaurant solutions sales and engineering staff and complete the planned expansion of sales staff for our European casino and gaming market. 
Interest. We recorded net interest expense of $8 thousand in the first quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2017. We do not expect significant changes in net interest expense for the full year 2018. 
Other, net. We recorded other income of $10 thousand in the first quarter of 2018 compared to other expense of $6 thousand in the first quarter of 2017. The change was due to foreign currency transaction exchange gains recorded in 2018 compared to foreign currency transaction losses recorded in the 2017 period. 
In the first three months of 2018, our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $838 thousand, or 15%, from December 31, 2017 and we ended the first quarter of 2018 with $4.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $315 thousand was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding. 
  ●  Accounts receivable decreased $2.3 million, or 21%, due to the collection of past due receivables for 2017 sales made to our former international casino and gaming distributor.     
  ●  Prepaid income taxes decreased $161 thousand during the first quarter of 2018.     
  ●  Accounts payable decreased $740 thousand, or 19%, due primarily to higher inventory purchases made towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2018 that were subsequently paid in the first quarter of 2018.     
  ●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $872 thousand, or 21%, due primarily to the payment of 2017 annual bonuses in March 2018.     
  ●  We reported net income of $943 thousand.     
  ●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $313 thousand, and share-based compensation expense of $146 thousand.     
  ●  Accounts receivable decreased $1.3 million, or 12%, due to the collection of receivables for sales made late in the fourth quarter of 2016.     
  ●  Inventories increased $254 thousand, or 3%, due largely to the purchase of AccuDate inventory to support expected restaurant solutions sales in 2017.     
  ●  Other current assets and long-term assets increased $169 thousand, or 45%, due largely to advance payments made in the first quarter of 2017 for annual ERP software maintenance expense.     
  ●  Accounts payable decreased $1.3 million, or 27%, due primarily to increased inventory purchases towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 and subsequently paid in the first quarter of 2017.     
  ●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $195 thousand due primarily to the payment of 2016 annual bonuses in March 2017. The decrease was partially offset by increased income taxes payable.     
In September 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program, with an initial quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share, subject to the Board's approval each quarter. Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017. Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $673 thousand, or $0.09 per share, and $587 thousand, or $0.08 per share, in the first quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2017, respectively. We expect to pay approximately $2.7 million in cash dividends to our common shareholders during 2018. 
On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the "2018 Stock Repurchase Program"). Under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $5 million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors. The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue it prior to such time. We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account. Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we repurchased 122,780 shares of our common stock for approximately $1.6 million at an average price per share of $12.72. 
We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our expected cash flows generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our TD Bank Credit Facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and dividend payments and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months. 
The disclosure of payments we have committed to make under our contractual obligations is set forth under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.  
There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2017. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
