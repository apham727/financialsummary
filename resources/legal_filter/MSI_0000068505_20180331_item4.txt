Item 4.
Controls and Procedures



(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue standard ASC 606.
Our new ERP system includes the replacement of regional systems supporting our product based business and back end finance processes including our general ledger.
The system also includes the replacement of our current indirect procurement and service contract systems.
We have made appropriate changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as we have implemented the new system.
We plan to continue to migrate the remaining parts of the business off regional systems as we work towards a single global platform.
We will continue to modify our internal controls in response to changes in the underlying ERP on future phases as needed.
