The segment managers responsible for each region report directly to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, and are accountable for the financial results and performance of their entire segment for which they are responsible. The business components within each segment are managed to maximize the results of the entire operating segment and Company rather than the results of any individual business component of the segment. 
We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on several factors primarily based on sales and net income.

Management Assessment of Liquidity 
We measure liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short-term and long-term operating needs, repay debt, fund additional investments, including acquisitions, and make dividend payments to shareholders. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, cash dividends, business acquisitions and access to bank lines of credit. 
Our investments include expenditures required for equipment and facilities as well as expenditures in support of our strategic initiatives. During the first nine months of 2018, we used cash of $7.3 million for capital expenditures. We ended the first nine months of 2018 with $34.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world. At September 30, 2018, the majority of our cash and cash equivalents were held outside the U.S. We expect most accumulated non-U.S. cash balances will remain outside of the U.S. and that we will meet U.S. liquidity needs through future cash flows, use of U.S. cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources. We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing financial statements for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues. We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity from customer credit issues. 
Total debt at September 30, 2018 was $37.9 million. At September 30, 2018, our unused availability under our line of credit was $42.5 million and our bank debt to equity percentage was 15.4%. On March 13, 2018, we extended the term on our $65 million credit facility from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2021. All other terms remain the same, including the interest rate at LIBOR plus 1.125% unless our funded debt to Earnings before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation ratio exceeds 2.25 to 1, then the LIBOR spread becomes 1.500%. The line of credit agreement contains, among other provisions, requirements for maintaining levels of net worth and funded debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization along with an interest coverage ratio. The net worth and profitability requirements are calculated based on the line of credit agreement. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (“cash’) decreased $4.8 million compared to the same period in 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.0 million. The most significant net investing and financing uses of cash were payments of long-term debt of $59.3 million, capital expenditures of $7.3 million, a combined net purchase of marketable securities and a company owned life insurance policy of $4.7 million, share repurchases of $4.1 million and dividends paid of $3.1 million, partially offset by net debt and notes payable proceeds of $60.6 million. Currency had a negative $1.6 million impact on cash and cash equivalents when translating foreign denominated financial statements to U.S. dollars. 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $7.1 million and $21.7 million, respectively. The $14.6 million decrease was primarily a result of an increase in cash usage for operating assets (net of operating liabilities) of $24.0 million, which included a $5.3 million contribution to the pension plan, partially offset by an increase in net income of $9.4 million. 
Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $12.0 million when compared to cash provided by investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The change was primarily related to a reduction in cash provided from fixed-term deposits of $7.8 million along with net cash used of $4.7 million related to the purchase of marketable securities and a company owned life insurance policy, partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures of $.5 million. 
Cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $4.8 million compared to a use of $15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The $10.9 million decrease was primarily the result of a net increase in debt  
borrowings in 2018 compared to 2017 of $12.3 million, partially offset by cash used for net stock issuances and repurchases of $1.4 million.
