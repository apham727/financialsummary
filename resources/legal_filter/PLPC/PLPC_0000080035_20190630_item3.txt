Effective July 1, 2018, Argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy as the projected three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%. As such, beginning July 1, 2018, the functional currency for the Company’s Argentina subsidiary became the U.S. dollar. The remeasurement impact to the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2019 was immaterial and is included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
The Company is exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates. The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable rate revolving credit facilities and term notes, which consisted of borrowings of $38.1 million at June 30, 2019. A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately $.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
