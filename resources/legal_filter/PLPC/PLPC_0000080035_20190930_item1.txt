Revenue recognition 
Net sales include products and shipping and handling charges, net of estimates for product returns. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products. All revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies the performance obligations under the contract and control of the product is transferred to the customer, primarily based on shipping terms. Revenue for shipping and handling charges are recognized at the time the products are shipped to, delivered to or picked up by the customer. The Company estimates product returns based on historical return rates.  
Disaggregated revenue 
Inventories – net 
Cost of inventories for certain material is determined using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method and totaled approximately $30.3 million at September 30, 2019 and $29.5 million at December 31, 2018. An actual valuation of inventories under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of the year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management’s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs. Because these estimates are subject to change and may be different than the actual inventory levels and costs at the end of the year, interim results are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019, the net change in LIFO inventories resulted in $.1 million and $.5 million of expense, respectively, to Income before income taxes. During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, the net change in LIFO inventories resulted in $.6 million and $1.1 million of expense, respectively, to Income before income taxes. 
Noncurrent inventory is included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(“Helix”) and Preformed Line Products (Canada) Limited (“PLPC Canada”), were each named, jointly and severally, with each of SNC-Lavalin ATP, Inc. (“SNC ATP”), HD Supply Canada Inc., by its trade names HD Supply Power Solutions and HD Supply Utilities (“HD Supply”), and Anixter Power Solutions Canada Inc. (the corporate successor to HD Supply), “Anixter” and, together with the Company, PLPC Canada, Helix, SNC ATP and HD Supply, the (“Defendants”) in a complaint filed by Altalink, L.P. (the “Plaintiff”) in the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta in Alberta, Canada in November 2016 (the “Complaint”). 
No contributions were made to the Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The Company does not plan to contribute additional funds to the Plan during the remainder of 2019. 
This AOCI component is included in the computation of net periodic pension costs. 
Basic earnings per share were computed by dividing Net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for each respective period. Diluted earnings per share were calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted-average of all potentially dilutive common stock that was outstanding during the periods presented. 
For both the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019, 15,000 stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. For both of the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, no stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as there was no anti-dilutive effect.  
At September 30, 2019, the Company’s total net Finite-lived intangible assets includes $3.9 million of Customer relationships and $3.7 million of Technology attributable to its newly acquired businesses. Refer to Note S, “Business Combinations” for further information regarding additions.  
The Company’s measurement date for its annual impairment test for goodwill is October 1st of each year. The Company performs its annual impairment test for goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology, market comparables, and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit. The Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value to assess if goodwill has been impaired. Based on the assumptions as to growth, discount rates and the weighting used for each respective valuation methodology, results of the valuations could be significantly different. However, the Company believes that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units. The Company’s valuation method uses Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy. 
The Company’s total Indefinite-lived intangible assets includes $10.4 million attributable to its newly acquired businesses. Refer to Note S, “Business Combinations” for further information regarding additions.  
The 1999 Stock Option Plan 
There were 750 and -0- stock options exercised under this Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  
As all stock options from the 1999 Stock Option Plan had been fully vested and exercised, the Company recorded no compensation expense related to stock options for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.  
Long Term Incentive Plan of 2008 and 2016 Incentive Plan 
The Company maintains an equity award program to give the Company a competitive advantage in attracting, retaining, and motivating officers, employees and directors and to provide an incentive to those individuals to increase shareholder value through long-term incentives directly linked to the Company’s performance. Under the Preformed Line Products Company Long Term Incentive Plan of 2008 (the “LTIP”), certain employees, officers, and directors were eligible to receive awards of options, restricted shares and restricted share units (RSUs). The total number of Company common shares reserved for awards under the LTIP was 900,000, of which 800,000 common shares were reserved for RSUs and 100,000 common shares have been reserved for share options. The LTIP was terminated and replaced with the Preformed Line Products Company 2016 Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”) in May 2016 upon approval by the Company’s Shareholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 10, 2016. No further awards will be made under the LTIP and previously granted awards remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. Under the Incentive Plan, certain employees, officers, and directors will be eligible to receive awards of options, restricted shares and RSUs. The total number of Company common shares reserved for awards under the Incentive Plan is 1,000,000 of which 900,000 common shares have been reserved for restricted share awards and 100,000 common shares have been reserved for share options. The Incentive Plan expires on May 10, 2026. 
For the regular annual grants, a portion of the RSUs is subject to time-based cliff vesting and a portion is subject to vesting based upon the Company’s performance over a set period for all participants except the CEO. All of the CEO’s regular annual RSUs are subject to vesting based upon the Company’s performance over a set-year period. 
The RSUs are offered at no cost to the employees. The fair value of RSUs is based on the market price of a common share on the grant date and the shares underlying the awards are not issued until they vest. Dividends declared are accrued in cash. 
For time-based RSUs, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award in General and administrative expense in the accompanying Statements of Consolidated Income. Compensation expense related to the time-based RSUs for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 was $.2 million and $.4 million, respectively. Compensation expense related to the time-based RSUs for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 was $.1 million and $.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2019, there was $.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to time-based RSUs that is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining period of approximately 1.8 years. 
For the performance-based RSUs, the number of RSUs in which the participants will vest depends on the Company’s level of performance measured by growth in either operating or pre-tax income and sales growth over a requisite performance period. Depending on the extent to which the performance criterions are satisfied under the LTIP and the Incentive Plan, the participants are eligible to earn common shares over the vesting period. Performance-based compensation expense for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 was $1.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Performance-based compensation expense for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 was $1.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2019, the remaining compensation expense of $4.8 million for outstanding performance-based RSU’s is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately 1.7 years. 
In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the LTIP and the Incentive Plan), vesting of the RSUs will be accelerated and all restrictions will lapse. Unvested performance-based awards will vest on a target potential payout.  
To satisfy the vesting of its RSU awards, the Company has reserved new shares from its authorized but unissued shares. Any additional awards granted will also be issued from the Company’s authorized but unissued shares. 
The LTIP permitted and now the Incentive Plan permits the grant of 100,000 options to buy common shares of the Company to certain employees at not less than fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. Options issued to date under the LTIP and the Incentive Plan vest 50% after one year following the date of the grant, 75% after two years, and 100% after three years, and expire from five to ten years from the date of grant. Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises will be funded with the issuance of new shares. 
There were no options granted for either of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. 
For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded compensation expense related to the stock options currently vested of less than $.1 million and $.1 million, respectively. For both three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, the Company recorded compensation expense related to the stock options currently vested of less than $.1 million. The total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized at September 30, 2019 is expected to be less than $.1 million over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.9 years. 
The Company maintains a trust, commonly referred to as a rabbi trust, in connection with the Company’s deferred compensation plan. This plan allows for two deferrals. First, Directors make elective deferrals of Director fees payable and held in the rabbi trust. The deferred compensation plan allows the Directors to elect to receive Director fees in common shares of the Company at a later date instead of fees paid each quarter in cash. Second, this plan allows certain Company employees to defer restricted shares or RSUs for future distribution in the form of common shares. Assets of the rabbi trust are consolidated, and the value of the Company’s common shares held in the rabbi trust is classified in Shareholders’ equity and generally accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock. The Company recognizes the original amount of the deferred compensation (fair value of the deferred stock award at the date of grant) as the basis for recognition in common shares issued to the rabbi trust. Changes in the fair value of amounts owed to certain employees or Directors are not recognized as the Company’s deferred compensation plan does not permit diversification and must be settled by the delivery of a fixed number of the Company’s common shares. As of September 30, 2019, 267,641 shares have been deferred and are being held in the rabbi trust. 
Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
Quoted prices for similar assets in active markets; 
Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; 
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and  
Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 
Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and developed using estimates and assumptions developed by the Company which reflect those that a market participant would use.  
The Company has a non-qualified Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan for its executives. The liability for this unfunded Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan was $5.3 million at September 30, 2019 and $4.9 million at December 31, 2018. These amounts are recorded within Other noncurrent liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. During January 2018, the Company amended the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan to allow the participants the ability to hypothetically invest their proportionate award into various investment options, which primarily includes mutual funds. The Company credits earnings, gains and losses to the participants’ deferred compensation account balances based on the investments selected by the participants. The Company measures the fair value of the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan liability using the market values of the participants’ underlying investment accounts. 
In order to mitigate the risk associated with the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan, the Company had invested in marketable securities, principally equity-based mutual funds, which were all transferred to the Company’s Corporate Owned Life Insurance Policy (“COLI”) in April 2019. The balance in the marketable securities of $0 million and $1.6 million were reported at fair value within Other current assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the cash surrender value of the COLI was $5.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, and is recorded in Other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of the securities of $.0 million and $.2 million were recognized within Other income, net within the consolidated statements of income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of the securities of less than $.1 million and $.1 million were recognized within Other income, net within the consolidated statements of income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively.   
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” The amendments in this update require the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet and the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation for leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. Both the asset and liability will initially be measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Subsequent measurement, including the presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a finance or an operating lease. Initial costs directly attributable to negotiating and arranging the lease will be included in the asset. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, the lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to not recognize an asset and corresponding liability. The lessee is also required to provide additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures are intended to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements and provide additional information about the nature of an organization’s leasing activities.  
This ASU was applied using a modified retrospective adoption method with the option of applying the guidance either retrospectively to each prior comparative reporting period presented or retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption, effective January 1, 2019. The Company applied the transitional package of practical expedients allowed by the standard to not reassess the identification, classification and initial direct costs of leases commencing before this ASU's effective date, however, the Company did not elect the hindsight transitional practical expedient. The Company also applied the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components to new leases as well as existing leases through transition. The Company also elected the practical expedient allowed under “Leases (Topic 842)” to exclude leases with a term of twelve months or less form the calculation of the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets.  
The Company has finalized its policy elections, the discount rate used and data to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard. The adoption of this ASU resulted in an initial recognition of right-of-use assets and corresponding current and long-term lease obligations, on a discounted basis, of its lease obligations of $10.4 million on the Company’s balance sheet at January 1, 2019. Refer to Note Q “Leases” for additional details regarding the Company’s leases as of September 30. 2019. The adoption of ASU 842 did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or debt covenants.  
The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. Recently issued ASUs that are not listed below were assessed and determined to be not applicable in the current reporting period. 
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement,” which will modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, including the removal of certain disclosure requirements. The amendments in ASU 2018-13 are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. An entity is permitted to early adopt any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance of the ASU and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until the effective date. The Company is currently evaluating what impact its adoption, effective January 1, 2020, will have to the presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  
During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded $.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits and as of September 30, 2019, the Company had $.1 million in total unrecognized tax benefits.

On March 13, 2018, the Company extended the term on its $65 million credit facility from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2021. All other terms remain the same, including the interest rate at LIBOR plus 1.125% unless its funded debt to Earnings before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation ratio exceeds 2.25 to 1, at which point the LIBOR spread becomes 1.500%. At September 30, 2019, the Company’s Polish subsidiary had borrowed $4.7 million U.S. dollars at a rate of 1.125% plus the Warsaw Interbank Offer Rate with a term expiring June 30, 2021.

Under the credit facility, at September 30, 2019, the Company had utilized $32.1 million with $32.9 million available under the line of credit, net of long-term outstanding letters of credit. The line of credit agreement contains, among other provisions, requirements for maintaining levels of net worth and profitability. At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.  
On February 28, 2019, the Company acquired its Austrian subsidiary, SubCon Electrical Fittings GmbH (“SubCon”), headquartered in Dornbirn, Austria.

At September 30, 2019, $5.2 million was outstanding on this facility, of which $.5 million is classified as current. This loan is secured by the Company’s New Zealand subsidiary’s land and building. 
For both periods ended September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company’s Asia Pacific segment had $.3 million in restricted cash used to secure bank debt. The restricted cash is shown on the balance sheet in Other assets.  
The Company regularly enters into leases in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2019, the leases in effect were related to land, buildings, vehicles, office equipment and other production equipment under operating leases with lease terms of up to 99 years. The Company often has the option to renew lease terms for buildings and other assets. The exercise of lease renewal options are generally at the Company’s sole discretion. In addition, certain lease arrangements may be terminated prior to their original expiration date at the Company’s discretion. The Company evaluates renewal and termination options at the lease commencement date to determine if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the option on the basis of economic factors. The weighted average remaining lease term for the Company’s operating and financing leases as of September 30, 2019 was 17.2 and 2.7, respectively. 
On February 6, 2019, the Company purchased 36,413 shares of the Company from current Officers at a price per share of $56.44, which was calculated from a 30-day average market price in connection with the vesting of equity awards.
