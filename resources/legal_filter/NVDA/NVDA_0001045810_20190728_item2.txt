Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
Starting with a focus on PC graphics, NVIDIA invented the GPU to solve some of the most complex problems in computer science. We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for better 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of virtual reality, high performance computing, or HPC, and artificial intelligence, or AI.
Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices. 
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2020 Summary
Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 decreased 17% year over year and increased 16% sequentially. 
GPU business revenue was $2.10 billion, down 21% from a year earlier and up 4% sequentially. 
Tegra Processor business revenue - which includes Automotive, SOC modules for gaming platforms, and embedded edge AI platforms - was $475 million, up 2% from a year ago and up 140% sequentially.
From a market-platforms perspective, Gaming revenue was $1.31 billion, down 27% from a year ago and up 24% sequentially. The year-on-year decrease reflects a decline in shipments of gaming desktop GPUs and SOC modules for gaming platforms, partially offset by growth in gaming notebook GPUs. The sequential increase reflects growth from SOC modules for gaming platforms, gaming notebook GPUs, and GeForce RTX SUPER gaming GPUs.
Professional Visualization revenue was $291 million, up 4% from a year earlier and up 9% sequentially. The year-on-year and sequential growth reflects strength across mobile workstation products. 
Automotive revenue of $209 million was up 30% from a year earlier and up 26% sequentially. The year-on-year and sequential growth was primarily driven by a development services agreement in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. The growth in revenue also reflected AI cockpit solutions and other autonomous vehicle development agreements. 
Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 was $571 million, down 51% from a year earlier and up 59% sequentially. Net income and net income per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 were $552 million and $0.90, respectively, down 50% and 49%, respectively, from a year earlier, and up 40% and 41%, respectively, sequentially. The year-on-year decrease reflects lower revenue and gross margin, and higher operating expenses. The sequential increase reflects higher revenue and gross margin.
We previously communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. In the first half of fiscal year 2020, we returned $195 million in quarterly cash dividends. We intend to return the remaining $2.11 billion through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. We do not expect to repurchase shares prior to the close of the acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd., or Mellanox, and therefore the intended repurchases may extend into fiscal year 2021.
On March 10, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Mellanox for $125 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion as of the date of the Merger Agreement. The closing of the merger is subject to approval by regulatory agencies. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals, we could be obligated to pay Mellanox a termination fee of $350 million. We have received regulatory approval in the United States and Mexico and are engaged with regulators in Europe and China. In June 2019, Mellanox shareholders approved the merger.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, in our Gaming platform, we introduced GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER, GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER and GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER to our GeForce GPU lineup; accelerated the momentum of ray-tracing games by supporting newly announced blockbuster titles; introduced new RTX Studio laptops powered by GeForce RTX and Quadro RTX GPUs for online and studio-based creatives and prosumers; and announced OEMs will be launching additional gaming laptops incorporating NVIDIA GeForce Turing GPUs.
In our Data Center platform, we announced NVIDIA's DGX SuperPOD, which provides the AI infrastructure for our autonomous-vehicle development program; set eight records in AI training performance in the latest MLPerf benchmarking tests; and announced support for Arm CPUs, providing a new path to build highly energy-efficient, AI-enabled exascale supercomputers.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, in our Gaming platform, we introduced the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, GTX 1660 and GTX 1650 gaming GPUs with improved performance and efficiency for today’s most popular games; announced a number of gaming laptop models based on Turing GPUs from top makers; and announced that real-time ray tracing is now integrated into Unreal Engine and Unity commercial game engines.
In our Data Center platform, we introduced the NVIDIA CUDA-X AI platform for accelerating data science; announced availability of NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs from leading OEMs and Amazon Web Services; partnered with global system builders to create powerful data-science workstations integrating NVIDIA Quadro RTX GPUs and NVIDIA CUDA-X AI; and launched beta access to NVIDIA Quadro Virtual Workstation software in the Alibaba Cloud Marketplace.
