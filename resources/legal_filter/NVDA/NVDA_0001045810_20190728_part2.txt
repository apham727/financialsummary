Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legal proceedings since January 27, 2019. Also refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 27, 2019 for a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. 
As of July 28, 2019, we were authorized to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.
We previously communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. In the first half of fiscal year 2020, we returned $195 million in quarterly cash dividends. We had no share repurchases during the first half of fiscal year 2020. We intend to return the remaining $2.11 billion through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. We do not expect to repurchase shares prior to the close of the acquisition of Mellanox, and therefore the intended repurchases may extend into fiscal year 2021. 
Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding
We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we withheld approximately 0.3 million shares at a total cost of $50 million through net share settlements. During the first half of fiscal year 2020, we withheld approximately 1.5 million shares at a total cost of $261 million through net share settlements. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.
