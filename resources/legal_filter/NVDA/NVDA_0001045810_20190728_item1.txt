Basis of Presentation
Significant Accounting Policies
We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.
Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities. 
Refer to Note 3 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2020 and 2019 are both 52-week years. The second quarters of fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were both 13-week quarters.
Principles of Consolidation
Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recent Accounting Pronouncement Not Yet Adopted
In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. The standard will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note 2 - Merger Agreement with Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.
On March 10, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Mellanox Technologies Ltd., or Mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Mellanox for $125 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion as of the date of the Merger Agreement. The closing of the merger is subject to approval by regulatory agencies. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals, we could be obligated to pay Mellanox a termination fee of $350 million. We have received regulatory approval in the United States and Mexico and are engaged with regulators in Europe and China. In June 2019, Mellanox shareholders approved the merger.
Method and Impact of Adoption
On January 28, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard using the optional transition method by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet and not adjusting comparative information for prior periods. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allowed us not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases. 
The cumulative-effect adjustment upon adoption of the new lease accounting standard resulted in the recognition of $470 million of operating lease assets and $500 million of operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The difference of $30 million represents deferred rent for leases that existed as of the date of adoption, which was an offset to the opening balance of operating lease assets.
Our lease obligations consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2020 and 2035.
Operating lease expense for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020 was $28 million and $55 million, respectively. Operating lease expense for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019 was $20 million and $36 million, respectively. Short-term and variable lease expenses for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020 were not significant. 
As of July 28, 2019, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8.7 years and a weighted average discount rate of 3.70%.
Equity Award Activity
As of July 28, 2019, there was $2.06 billion of aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, and 1.1 years for ESPP.
Note 5 – Net Income Per Share
We recognized an income tax expense of $54 million and $48 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020, respectively, and $79 million and $146 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020 was 8.8% and 4.9%, respectively, and 6.7% and 5.9% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, respectively.
Note 7 - Marketable Securities 
Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as “available-for-sale” debt securities.
For the second quarter and first half of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, there were no other-than-temporary impairment losses and net realized gains were not significant.
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of cash equivalents and marketable securities as of July 28, 2019 and January 27, 2019 are shown below by contractual maturity. 
Note 8 – Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities
The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets. We review fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis.
Note 9 - Amortizable Intangible Assets
The increase in gross carrying amount of intangible assets is due to purchases of licensed technology during the first half of fiscal year 2020. Amortization expense associated with intangible assets was $6 million and $13 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020, respectively, and $6 million and $17 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, respectively. Future amortization expense related to the net carrying amount of intangible assets as of July 28, 2019 is estimated to be $12 million for the remainder of fiscal year 2020, $16 million in fiscal year 2021, $9 million in fiscal year 2022, $7 million in fiscal year 2023, and $5 million in fiscal year 2024.

Note 12 - Debt
Long-Term Debt
2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026
In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021, and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the Notes. Interest on the Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026. The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs.
The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.

Litigation
Litigation Related to Mellanox Merger
On May 3, 2019, an alleged stockholder of Mellanox filed a putative class action lawsuit alleging that the proxy statement filed by Mellanox in connection with the stockholder vote on NVIDIA’s pending acquisition of Mellanox violates Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and asserting claims under those statutes against Mellanox and its board of directors as well as NVIDIA. The complaint, which is captioned Stein v. Mellanox Technologies, Ltd., et al., Case No. 19-2428 (United States District Court, Northern District of California), seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and unspecified damages. A number of other alleged Mellanox stockholders have filed substantially similar lawsuits against Mellanox and its directors in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, but to date, NVIDIA has not been named as a defendant in any of these other lawsuits.
