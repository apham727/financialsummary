Trends and Events
Foreign currency
Our exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relates to exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the euro, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, British pound, Indian rupee, and Brazilian real. Generally, as the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are negatively impacted as our foreign denominated revenues and earnings are translated into U.S. dollars at a lower rate. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are positively impacted. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues were to customers outside of the U.S.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 1.7%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018.

Income before taxes increased $23.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018.
