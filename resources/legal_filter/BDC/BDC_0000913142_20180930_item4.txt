Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2018.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, because of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described in our 2017 Form 10-K as filed on February 13, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2018.
In our prior Form 10-K filing, we identified and reported a material weakness in the Companyâ€™s internal control over financial reporting related to our internal controls over ensuring that all revenue recognition criteria are satisfied prior to the recognition of revenue. We are executing our remediation plan as described fully in our 2017 Form 10-K. In response to the identified material weakness, our management, with oversight from our audit committee, has dedicated resources to improve our control environment and to remedy the identified material weakness.
