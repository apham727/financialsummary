Trends and Events
Foreign currency
Our exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relates to exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the euro, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, British pound, Indian rupee, and Brazilian real. Generally, as the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are negatively impacted as our foreign denominated revenues and earnings are translated into U.S. dollars at a lower rate. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are positively impacted. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues were to customers outside of the U.S.

Results of Operations
Consolidated Income before Taxes 
The decrease in volume was primarily experienced in our Enterprise solutions segment, partially offset by an increase in volume in our Industrial solutions segment. 
Gross profit decreased $16.6 million and $22.4 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018. Gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2019 decreased due to the decreases in revenue discussed above and was further impacted from unfavorable mix which was partially offset by decreases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs of $6.8 million from the comparable period of 2018. Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased due to the decreases in revenue discussed above and was further impacted from unfavorable mix which was partially offset by decreases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs of $15.7 million from the comparable period of 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $16.4 million and $18.4 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018 primarily due to a decrease in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs of $12.2 million and $18.8 million, respectively.
Research and development expenses decreased $2.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018 primarily due to a decrease in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs of $2.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively.
Amortization of intangibles decreased $2.7 million and $3.7 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018 primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.
Operating income increased $4.6 million and $4.9 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018 as the decreases in operating expenses were greater than the decreases in gross profit discussed above.
Net interest expense decreased $0.9 million and $3.7 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018 as a result of our debt transactions during 2018. In March 2018, we issued €350.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2028 at an interest rate of 3.875%, and used the net proceeds of this offering and cash on hand to repurchase all of our outstanding €200.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023 as well as all of our outstanding $200.0 million 5.25% senior subordinated notes due 2024. 
The loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2018 represents the premium paid to the bond holders to retire a portion of the 2023 and 2024 notes and the unamortized debt issuance costs written-off. 
Income before taxes increased $9.3 million and $33.1 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018. This increase is primarily a result of the loss on debt extinguishment in the prior year as well as the decline in net interest expense and increase in operating income over the year ago periods discussed above.
Consolidated Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA 
The decrease in volume was primarily experienced in our Enterprise solutions segment, partially offset by an increase in volume in our Industrial solutions segment.

Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2019 decreased due to the decreases in Adjusted Revenues discussed above and was further impacted by unfavorable mix as compared to the comparable period of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased due to the decreases in Adjusted Revenues discussed above and was further impacted by unfavorable mix.

Enterprise Solutions revenues decreased $29.8 million and $54.3 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2018. For the three months ended June 30, 2019, decreases in volume, unfavorable currency translation, and lower copper prices contributed an estimated $32.5 million, $4.9 million, and $1.8 million to the decline in revenues, respectively, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, which contributed an estimated $9.4 million increase in revenues. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, decreases in volume, unfavorable currency translation, and lower copper prices contributed an estimated $58.3 million, $10.4 million, and $3.9 million to the decline in revenues, respectively, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, which contributed an estimated $18.3 million increase in revenues. The decrease in volume was primarily due to softer demand in the final mile broadband and live media production markets. 
Enterprise Solutions EBITDA decreased $16.8 million and $34.7 million, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the year ago periods primarily as a result of the decline in revenues discussed above. 
Industrial Solutions 
Industrial Solutions revenues decreased $4.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018, and remained flat in the six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018. The decrease in revenues in the three months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018 was primarily due to unfavorable currency translation and lower copper prices which had an estimated impact of $6.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, and was partially offset by an increase in volume which had an estimated impact of $5.1 million. Revenues in the six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018 remained flat as the increase in volume of $20.5 million, was offset by the decrease from unfavorable currency translation and lower copper prices, which had an estimated impact of $14.4 million and $6.0 million, respectively.
Industrial Solutions EBITDA decreased $5.8 million and $4.7 million, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 from the comparable periods of 2018 primarily as a result of the changes in revenues discussed above and investments in product development. 
Operating cash flows were a source of cash of $21.6 million in 2019 and a use of cash of $29.4 million in 2018 representing an improvement of $51.0 million. The improvement in operating cash flows as compared to prior year is primarily due to an increase in net income of $36.1 million, and effective working capital management that resulted in an increase in cash received from receivables and inventory of $32.7 million and $31.8 million, respectively, over the year ago period. 
Net cash used for investing activities totaled $101.3 million in 2019, compared to $82.4 million for the comparable period of 2018. Investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 included capital expenditures of $50.8 million compared to $39.5 million in the comparable period of 2018. The increase in capital expenditures of $11.3 million is due in part to the investments we are making in India and software development. The six months ended June 30, 2019 included payments, net of cash acquired for acquisitions of $50.5 million primarily for the acquisition of Opterna, and the six months ended July 1, 2018 included payments, net of cash acquired for acquisitions of $84.6 million for SAM and NT2. Additionally, the six months ended July 1, 2018 included proceeds from the disposal of the MCS business and Hirshmann JV of $40.2 million, which closed on December 31, 2017.

Additional discussion regarding our various borrowing arrangements is included in Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
