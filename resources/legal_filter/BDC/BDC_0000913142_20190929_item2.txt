Belden Inc. (the Company, us, we, or our) is a global supplier of specialty networking solutions built around two global business platforms - Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions. Our comprehensive portfolio of solutions enables customers to transmit and secure data, sound, and video for mission critical applications across complex enterprise and industrial environments.
We use a set of tools and processes that are designed to continuously improve business performance in the critical areas of quality, delivery, cost, and innovation. We consider revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flows, and return on invested capital to be our key operating performance indicators. We also seek to acquire businesses that we believe can help us achieve these objectives. 
Our exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relates to exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the euro, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, British pound, Indian rupee, and Brazilian real. Generally, as the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are negatively impacted as our foreign denominated revenues and earnings are translated into U.S. dollars at a lower rate. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are positively impacted. During the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, approximately 48% of our consolidated revenues were to customers outside of the U.S.
We completed the acquisitions of Opterna International Corp. (Opterna) on April 15, 2019 and FutureLink on April 5, 2019. The results of Opterna and FutureLink have been included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition dates and are reported in the Enterprise Solutions segment. See Note 3.
We performed an interim impairment test on our Grass Valley reporting unit, which resulted in a total goodwill and other asset impairment charge of $342.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019. See Note 8.
In 2019, we began a restructuring program to integrate Opterna and FutureLink with our existing businesses. The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions. We recognized $3.1 million and $5.6 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively. The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment. We do not expect to incur any more costs for this program. 
In 2018, we began a restructuring program to integrate SAM with Grass Valley. The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions. We recognized $3.0 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the nine months ended September 29, 2019. The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment. The integration of these businesses is complete, and thus, we do not expect to incur any more costs for this program. 
On July 15, 2019, all outstanding Preferred Stock was automatically converted into shares of Belden common stock at the conversion rate of 132.50, resulting in the issuance of approximately 6.9 million shares of Belden common stock.

During the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, dividends on the Preferred Stock were $1.0 million and $18.4 million, respectively. See Note 15.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we committed to a plan to sell Grass Valley, and at such time, met all of the criteria to classify the assets and liabilities of this business as held for sale. As a result, the Grass Valley disposal group, which is currently part of the Enterprise Solutions segment, will be included in discontinued operations commencing in the fourth quarter. We intend to complete the sale of the Grass Valley disposal group during the next twelve months.

A decline in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; improved productivity; and currency translation contributed $21.9 million, $14.3 million, and $3.9 million, respectively, to the decrease in selling, general 
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 29, 2019 as compared to the year ago period; partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, which increased selling, general and administrative expenses by $9.1 million. The improved productivity stems from successful cost saving measures implemented during the current year. 
Research and development expenses decreased $2.1 million and $7.2 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2018.

Currency translation contributed $0.3 million and $1.1 million to the decline in research and development expenses in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, as compared to the year ago period. The above decreases were partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, which increased research and development expenses by $0.1 million and 1.5 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, as compared to the year ago period. 
Amortization of intangibles decreased $3.3 million and $7.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2018 primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.

For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, we recognized income tax expense of $2.8 million and $13.6 million, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of (1.0)% and (6.3)%, respectively. The effective tax rates were impacted by an income tax benefit of $5.7 million as a result of changes in our estimated valuation allowance requirement related to foreign tax credits due to the restructuring of certain foreign operations. These effective rates are also reflective of the impact of more favorable statutory tax rates applied to the earnings of these foreign operations due to the restructuring efforts. The income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019 was also impacted by a $5.1 million income tax benefit for the partial deductibility of the goodwill and other asset impairment charge during the period.

Significant factors affecting our cash liquidity include (1) cash from operating activities, (2) disposals of businesses and tangible assets, (3) cash used for acquisitions, restructuring actions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, and senior subordinated note repurchases, (4) our available credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements, and (5) cash proceeds from equity offerings. We expect our operating activities to generate cash in 2019 and believe our sources of liquidity are sufficient to 
Operating cash flows were a source of cash of $89.5 million and $100.9 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The $11.4 million decline as compared to prior year is primarily due to the $62 million pre-tax cash proceeds from the Corning patent litigation received in 2018. Excluding the patent litigation proceeds, operating cash flows increased year-over-year due in part to favorable changes in receivables and inventory. Receivables were a source of cash of $6.0 million compared to a use of cash of $25.3 million in the prior year. Inventory was a source of cash of $32.3 million compared to a use of cash of $16.6 million in the prior year. The improvements in receivables and inventory are attributable to effective working capital management.
