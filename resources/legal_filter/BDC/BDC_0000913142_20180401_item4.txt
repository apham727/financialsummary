Item 4: Controls and Procedures
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, because of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described in our 2017 Form 10-K as filed on February 13, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of April 1, 2018.
In our prior Form 10-K filing, we identified and reported a material weakness in the Companyâ€™s internal control over financial reporting related to our internal controls over ensuring that all revenue recognition criteria are satisfied prior to the recognition of revenue. We are executing our remediation plan as described fully in our 2017 Form 10-K. In response to the identified material weakness, our management, with oversight from our audit committee, has dedicated resources to improve our control environment and to remedy the identified material weakness.
We believe that we have designed the appropriate controls to remediate the material weakness and began executing the controls during the three months ended April 1, 2018. These controls include additional procedures related to the review of material contracts. However, the Company is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new processes for a sufficient period of time. Therefore, until all remedial actions, including the efforts to test the control activities, are fully completed, the material weakness identified 
will continue to exist. We are committed to achieving and maintaining a strong control environment, high ethical standards, and financial reporting integrity and transparency.
