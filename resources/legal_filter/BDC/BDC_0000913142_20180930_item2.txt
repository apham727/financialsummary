Overview
Belden Inc. (the Company, us, we, or our) is a signal transmission solutions company built around two global business platforms – Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions. Our comprehensive portfolio of signal transmission solutions provides industry leading secure and reliable transmission of data, sound, and video for mission critical applications.
We use a set of tools and processes that are designed to continuously improve business performance in the critical areas of quality, delivery, cost, and innovation. We consider revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flows, and return on invested capital to be our key operating performance indicators. We also seek to acquire businesses that we believe can help us achieve these objectives. 
Trends and Events
Foreign currency
Our exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relates to exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, British pound, and Brazilian real. Generally, as the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are negatively impacted as our foreign denominated revenues and earnings are translated into U.S. dollars at a lower rate. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, our revenues and earnings are positively impacted. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, approximately 48% and 49% of our consolidated revenues were to customers outside of the U.S, respectively.

Market Growth and Market Share
Effective January 1, 2018, we changed our organizational structure and, as a result, now are reporting two segments. The segments formerly known as Broadcast Solutions and Enterprise Solutions now are presented as the Enterprise Solutions segment, and the segments formerly known as Industrial Solutions and Network Solutions now are presented as the Industrial Solutions segment. The reorganization allows us to further accelerate progress in key strategic areas and the segment consolidation properly aligns our external reporting with the way the businesses are now managed. We have recast the prior period segment information to conform to the change in the composition of these reportable segments.
Acquisitions
In March 2018, we issued €350.0 million ($431.3 million at issuance) aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2028 at an interest rate of 3.875%. During March and April 2018, we used the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase our outstanding $200.0 million 5.25% senior subordinated notes due 2024 and our outstanding €200.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023. We paid approximately $7.5 million of fees related to issuing the 2028 notes, and recognized a $23.0 million loss on debt extinguishment during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 for premiums paid to the bond holders to retire the 2024 and 2023 notes and for the unamortized debt issuance costs that we wrote-off. See Note 10.
On July 5, 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary, PPC Broadband, Inc. (PPC), filed an action for patent infringement against Corning Optical Communications RF LLC (Corning). The complaint alleged that Corning infringed two of PPC’s patents. In July 2015, a jury found that Corning willfully infringed both patents. In November 2016, following a series of post-trial motions, the trial judge issued rulings for a total judgment in our favor of approximately $61.3 million. In December 2016, Corning appealed the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2018, a panel of three judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a Rule 36 Affirmance of the District Court's final judgment that Corning, among other things, willfully infringed the PPC universal compression patents at issue in the case, and that PPC should be awarded approximately $61.8 million, plus accrued interest. In April 2018, Corning filed a petition for re-hearing, which was denied in May 2018. On July 16, 2018, the District Court ruled that Corning shall pay the judgments. We received a pre-tax amount of approximately $62.1 million from Corning on July 19, 2018. We recorded the $62.1 million of cash received as a pre-tax gain from patent litigation during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018. Prior to the third quarter of 2018, we had not recognized any amounts in our consolidated financial statements related to this matter. On September 27, 2018, Corning filed a petition for certiorari review by the U.S. Supreme Court of the District Court’s decision to exercise its discretion to award PPC $23.85 million in enhanced damages based on the totality of the evidence, including a number of factual findings regarding Corning’s willful infringement and egregious conduct. For at least the same reasons why the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision to enhance damages, we believe that Corning’s certiorari petition will not be granted, thus exhausting Corning’s opportunities for further appellate relief.
During the first quarter of 2018, we began a restructuring program to integrate SAM with Grass Valley. The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions. We recognized $7.1 million and $36.6 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment. 
We expect to incur approximately $12 million of additional severance and restructuring costs for this program, which will be incurred during the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019. We also expect the program to generate approximately $44 million of savings on an annualized basis, which we began to realize in the third quarter of 2018.
Industrial Manufacturing Footprint Program
In 2016, we began a program to consolidate our manufacturing footprint. The manufacturing consolidation will be completed this year. We recognized $4.3 million and $15.8 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments, as the manufacturing locations involved in the program serve both platforms. We expect the program to generate approximately $13 million of savings on an annualized basis, which we began to realize in the third quarter of 2017. 
Critical Accounting Policies
•We did not change any of our existing critical accounting policies from those listed in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K other than updating our revenue recognition accounting policies for the adoption of ASU 2014-09;
Consolidated Income before Taxes
•Acquisitions contributed an estimated $27.2 million and $93.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
•Higher sales volume and increases in pricing resulted in an increase of $20.2 million and $34.7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
•Copper prices had a $0.2 million unfavorable impact on revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2018, and a $17.0 million favorable impact on revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
•Currency translation had a $5.3 million unfavorable impact on revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2018, and a $22.3 million favorable impact on revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
•The divestiture of our MCS business resulted in a $7.8 million and $20.8 million decrease in revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. 
Gross profit increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017 due to the increases in revenues discussed above. In the three months ended September 30, 2018, decreases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; purchase accounting effects of acquisitions; and accelerated depreciation of $7.6 million, $2.3 million, and $0.3 million, respectively, further contributed to the increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in the amortization of software development intangible assets as compared to the year ago period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, decreases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; purchase accounting effects of acquisitions; and accelerated depreciation of $5.0 million, $2.3 million, and $0.8 million, respectively, further contributed to the increase in gross profit, partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in the amortization of software development intangible assets as compared to the year ago period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $16.6 million and $49.6 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, acquisitions; costs related to patent litigation; and increases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; contributed an estimated $5.9 million, $2.6 million, and $2.1 million, respectively, to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the impact of capacity constraints, currency translation, and the MCS divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2017, which contributed to a decline of approximately $3.2 million, $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively, over the year ago period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, increases in acquisitions; severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; currency translation; and costs related to patent litigation contributed an estimated $29.2 million, $23.9 million, $5.0 million, and $2.6 million, respectively, to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by improved productivity and the MCS divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2017, which contributed to a decline of approximately $16.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively, over the year ago period. 
Research and development expenses decreased $2.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017, and increased $2.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, acquisitions and increases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs contributed an estimated $1.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, to the increase in research and development expenses year-over-year. These increases were more than offset by $3.3 million, $0.6 million, and $0.2 million from improved productivity, the MCS divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2017, and currency translation, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, acquisitions; increases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; and currency translation contributed an estimated $10.5 million, $5.2 million, and $1.6 million, respectively, to the increase in research and development expenses year-over-year. These increases were partially offset by $12.8 million and $1.7 million from improved productivity and the MCS divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. 
Amortization of intangibles decreased $1.6 million and $3.0 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017. The decrease is due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, which contributed to a total increase of $2.6 million and $10.8 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the year ago period. 
Operating income increased $70.2 million and $56.5 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017 primarily due to the gain from patent litigation and increases in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by the changes in operating expenses discussed above. 
Net interest expense decreased $4.9 million, or 25.3%, and $19.9 million, or 29.9%, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2017 as a result of our debt transactions during 2017 and 2018. In July 2017, we issued €450.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2027 at an interest rate of 3.375%, and used the net proceeds of this offering and cash on hand to repurchase all of our outstanding $700.0 million 5.5% senior 
subordinated notes due 2022. In September 2017, we issued €300.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2025 at an interest rate of 2.875%, and used the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase €300.0 million of our outstanding €500.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023. In March 2018, we issued €350.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2028 at an interest rate of 3.875%, and used the net proceeds of this offering and cash on hand to repurchase all of our outstanding €200.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023 as well as all of our outstanding $200.0 million 5.25% senior subordinated notes due 2024. See Note 10.
The loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2018 represents the premium paid to the bond holders to retire the 2023 and 2024 notes as well as the unamortized debt issuance costs that were written-off. The loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2017 represents the premium paid to the bond holders to retire the 2022 and a portion of the 2023 notes as well as the unamortized debt issuance costs that were written-off and the unamortized debt issuance costs related to creditors no longer participating in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Revolver), which we amended in May 2017. See Note 10. 
For the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recognized $118.2 million of income before taxes, as compared to a $10.2 million loss before taxes in the year ago period. Income before taxes increased $107.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017. The increase in income before taxes is attributable to the increase in operating income, decrease in interest expense, and decrease in the loss on debt extinguishment discussed above.
•We recognized income tax expense of $3.8 million and $4.3 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 as a result of changes in our valuation allowance for the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the Act). The amount of this adjustment remains provisional under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) as of the date of this report.
All other items impacting the effective tax rate represented a net expense of $2.6 million and $2.3 million in the three and nine months ended October 1, 2017, respectively.

Accordingly, EBITDA margins expanded 120 and 110 basis points, respectively, over the year ago period.
Industrial Solutions
Industrial Solutions revenues increased in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, volume growth and pricing increases contributed $16.0 million and higher copper prices contributed $0.3 million to the increase in revenues, partially offset by $7.8 million from the MCS divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2017 and unfavorable currency translation of $2.5 million.

Industrial Solutions EBITDA decreased $2.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 from the comparable periods of 2017. The revenue growth discussed above was offset by unfavorable product mix and temporary inefficiencies related to extended lead times throughout the supply chain experienced in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Significant factors affecting our cash liquidity include (1) cash from operating activities, (2) disposals of businesses and tangible assets, (3) cash used for acquisitions, restructuring actions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, and senior subordinated note repurchases, (4) our available credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements, and (5) cash proceeds from 
Net cash used for investing activities totaled $106.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $200.3 million for the comparable period of 2017.

The increase in capital expenditures year-over-year is due in part to the investments we are making in India as well as research and development. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, capital expenditures included an incremental $13.8 million of software development costs related to projects that are creating new technologies that will drive future growth.
Our outstanding debt obligations as of September 30, 2018 consisted of $1,527.0 million of senior subordinated notes.
