Note 1.
Basis of Presentation



Basis of Presentation



The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the “Company” or “Juniper”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
GAAP”) for interim financial information.
The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017, has been derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements at that date.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, including normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.
The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
2016-18 (Topic 230) Statement of Cash Flow: Restricted Cash, effective January 1, 2018, using the retrospective transition method.
Restricted cash of $47.4 million and $48.7 million in the prior period have been included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending total amounts, respectively, on the statement of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017, to conform to the current period presentation.
The adoption did not have a material impact on the cash flow activity presented on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
See Note 3, Cash Equivalents and Investments for a reconciliation of the cash balances within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Note 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



Except for the change in certain policies upon adoption of the accounting standards described below, there have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies, compared to the accounting policies described in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of the Form 10-K.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standard



Comprehensive Income: Effective January 1, 2018, the Company early adopted FASB ASU No.
The adoption resulted in a reclassification of $5.7 million in income from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to accumulated deficit as of the adoption date.
The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
Financial Instruments: On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted FASB ASU No.
2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities and FASB ASU No.
2018-03, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Financial Instruments - Overall, which changes how entities classify and measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option.
The guidance also updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements.
The impact of the adoption on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements was as follows:

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)



(Unaudited)



•Equity investments with readily determinable fair value: The Company is required to account for changes in fair value of its equity investments with readily determinable fair value in the statements of operations.
The Company adopted the standard using a modified retrospective transition method, resulting in no impact to the January 1, 2018 opening accumulated deficit balance.
•Equity investments without readily determinable fair value: The Company elected the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes on a prospective basis for all equity investments without readily determinable fair value and is required to account for any subsequent observable changes in fair value in the statements of operations.
In addition, the Company is required to perform a qualitative assessment considering impairment indicators at each reporting period to evaluate whether the investment is impaired.
If the investment is impaired, the Company will estimate the fair value of the investment and record an impairment loss in the statements of operations equal to the difference between the estimated fair value of the investment and its carrying amount.
See Note 3, Cash Equivalents and Investments for additional disclosures required upon adopting the standard.
The Company adopted the standard using a modified retrospective transition method, resulting in no impact to the January 1, 2018 opening accumulated deficit balance.
Revenue Recognition: On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted FASB ASU No.
2014-09 (Topic 606) - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09” or "Topic 606"), which provides guidance for revenue recognition that superseded the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ("Topic 605") and most industry specific guidance.
Under ASU 2014-09, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 under the modified retrospective approach, applying the amendments to prospective reporting periods.
Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the historic accounting under Topic 605.
The cumulative effect of the changes made to our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2018 for the adoption of Topic 606 to all contracts with customers that were not completed as of December 31, 2017 was recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the adoption date as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Juniper Networks, Inc.



Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)



(Unaudited)



Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $313.5 million, net of tax adjustment of $61.4 million, which decreased the January 1, 2018 opening accumulated deficit balance on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily as a result of the following items:



•Distributor Sales: Under Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue from sales to distributors upon delivery of the product to the distributor, rather than upon delivery of the product to the end customer.
Rebates and incentives offered to distributors, which are earned when sales to end customers are completed, are estimated at the point of revenue recognition.
•Software Revenue: Under Topic 605, the Company deferred revenue for software licenses where vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of fair value had not been established for undelivered items (primarily services).
•Variable Consideration: Some of the Company's contracts include penalties, extended payment terms, acceptance provisions or other price variability that precluded revenue recognition under Topic 605 because of the requirement for amounts to be fixed or determinable.
Topic 606 requires the Company to estimate and account for variable consideration as a reduction of the transaction price.
•Revenue Allocation: Similar to Topic 605, Topic 606 requires an allocation of revenue between deliverables, or performance obligations, within an arrangement.
Topic 605 restricted the allocation of revenue that is contingent on future deliverables to current deliverables; however, Topic 606 removes this restriction.
In addition, the nature of the performance obligations identified within a contract under Topic 606 as compared to Topic 605 will impact the allocation of the transaction price between product and services.
•Contract Acquisition Costs: Topic 606 requires the deferral and amortization of “incremental” costs incurred to obtain a contract where the associated contract duration is greater than one year.
The primary contract acquisition cost for the Company are sales commissions.
Prior to January 1, 2018, the Company expensed sales commissions.
The change required by Topic 606 resulted in the creation of an asset on January 1, 2018.

Revenue Recognition



Revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price, and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation, as further described below.
Identify the contract with a customer.
The Company generally considers a sales contract or agreement with an approved purchase order as a customer contract provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances.
The Company combines contracts with a customer if contracts are negotiated with a single commercial substance or contain price dependencies.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
Product performance obligations include hardware and software licenses and service performance obligations include maintenance, software post-contract support, training, and professional services.
Certain software licenses and related post-contract support are combined into a single performance obligation when the maintenance updates are critical to the continued functionality of the software.
Determine the transaction price.
The Company generally invoices customers for hardware, software licenses and related maintenance arrangements at time of delivery, and professional services either upfront or upon meeting certain milestones.
Customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance.
The Company’s contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis.
Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
Revenue for hardware and certain software licenses, are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery.
Revenue for maintenance and software post-contract support is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term.
Revenue from training and professional services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less.
Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective



Derivatives and Hedging: In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
The new standard is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities: In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-08 Receivables—Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities which shortens the amortization period for the premium on certain purchased callable debt securities to the earliest call date.
The ASU will not impact debt securities held at a discount.
This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, and is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment: In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
Under the amended guidance, a goodwill impairment charge will now be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.
This ASU will be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. 



Credit Losses on Financial Instruments: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-13 (Topic 326) Financial Instruments—Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which provides more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and changes the loss impairment methodology.
This pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, using a modified retrospective adoption method.
Early adoption is permitted.
Leases: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02 (Topic 842), Leases, which requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet by lessees for leases classified as operating leases with a lease term of more than twelve months.
This ASU should be applied on a modified retrospective basis and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is permitted.
The Company has commenced the assessment phase to determine the approach for implementing this standard and expects it to have a material impact on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and disclosures.

Note 3.
As of March 31, 2018, the Company had 583 investments in unrealized loss positions.
The gross unrealized losses related to these investments were primarily due to changes in market interest rates.
The Company anticipates that it will recover the entire amortized cost basis of such available-for-sale debt securities and has determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, there were no material gross realized gains or losses from available-for-sale debt securities.

The Company's Level 2 available-for-sale debt securities are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or non-binding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data.
The Company's derivative instruments are classified as Level 2, as they are not actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs.
The Company's policy is to recognize asset or liability transfers among Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 at the beginning of the quarter in which a change in circumstances resulted in a transfer.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company had no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy of its assets or liabilities measured at fair value.
All of the Company's privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock securities are classified as Level 3 assets due to the lack of observable inputs to determine fair value.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, there were no significant activities related to privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stocks securities.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis



Certain of the Company's assets, including intangible assets and goodwill are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, when they are deemed to be other-than temporarily impaired.
There were no impairment charges recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at fair value, when they are deemed to be impaired or when there is an adjustment from observable price changes.
As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had no liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of the Company's short-term and long-term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was $2,200.0 million and $2,252.9 million, respectively, based on observable market inputs (Level 2).
The carrying value of the promissory note issued to the Company in connection with the previously completed sale of Junos Pulse (the “Pulse Note”), of $61.2 million approximates its fair value as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
The Pulse Note is classified as a Level 3 asset due to the lack of observable inputs to determine fair value.

Restructuring (Benefits) Charges



During 2017, the Company initiated a restructuring plan (the “2017 Restructuring Plan”) to realign its workforce and increase operational efficiencies.
The 2017 Restructuring Plan consisted of severance and contract termination costs that were recorded to restructuring (benefits) charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Note 8. Financing Arrangements



The Company provides certain customers with access to extended financing arrangements that allow for longer payment terms than those typically provided by the Company by factoring accounts receivable to third-party financing providers (“financing providers”).
The program does not and is not intended to affect the timing of the Company's revenue recognition.
Under the financing arrangements, proceeds from the financing providers are due to the Company within 1 to 90 days from the sale of the receivable.
In these transactions with the financing providers, the Company surrenders control over the transferred assets.
The Company received cash proceeds from financing providers of $33.0 million and $23.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively.
As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the amounts owed by the financing providers were $16.5 million and $13.7 million, respectively, which were recorded in accounts receivable in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Equity



Cash Dividends on Shares of Common Stock



During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share of common stock on January 30, 2018, which was paid on March 22, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 1, 2018 in the aggregate amount of $62.1 million.
Any future dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, are subject to approval by the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Juniper Networks or an authorized committee thereof.
See Note 15, Subsequent Events, for discussion of the Company's dividend declaration subsequent to March 31, 2018.
Stock Repurchase Activities 



In January 2018, the Board approved a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, including $750.0 million to be used pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program ("2018 Stock Repurchase Program").
The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program replaces the previous authorization approved by the Board in 2014 ("2014 Stock Repurchase Program").
As part of the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, in February 2018, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program (the "ASR") with two financial institutions to repurchase $750.0 million of the Company's common stock.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company made an up-front payment of $750.0 million pursuant to the ASR and received an initial 23.3 million shares of the Company's common stock for an aggregate price of $600.0 million, based on the market value of the Company's common stock on the date of the transaction.
The initial shares received by the Company were retired, accounted

for as a reduction to stockholders' equity in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and treated as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of calculating earnings per share.
The forward contract for the remaining $150.0 million is considered indexed to the Company's common stock and met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification.
Final settlement of the transactions under the ASR is expected to be completed no sooner than May 11, 2018 and no later than August 6, 2018.
If the initial shares received are less than the calculated total number of shares to be ultimately received under the ASR, then the financial institutions will be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to the Company at settlement.
If however, the initial shares received are greater than the calculated total number of shares to be ultimately received, the Company has the option to either issue shares of common stock or make cash payments to the financial institutions.
The following table summarizes the Company's stock repurchases and retirements, including prepayment pursuant to the ASR, under its stock repurchase programs (in millions, except per share amounts):

(2) Shares repurchased under the 2014 Stock Repurchase Program.
As of March 31, 2018, there was $1.3 billion of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.
In addition to repurchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, the Company also repurchases common stock from certain employees in connection with the net issuance of shares to satisfy applicable tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of certain stock awards issued to such employees.
Repurchases associated with tax withholdings were not material during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 



On November 6, 2017, the Company’s Compensation Committee amended and restated the ESPP to provide that for the offering period that begins on February 1, 2018, the ESPP will consist of a 24-month offering period with four 6-month purchase periods in each offering period.
The purchase price for the Company’s common stock under the ESPP will be 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the shares at (1) the beginning of a rolling 2 year offering period or (2) the end of each 6-month purchase period during such offering period.
The ESPP will continue in effect until February 25, 2028, unless terminated earlier under the provisions of the ESPP.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, employees purchased approximately 1.3 million and 1.5 million shares of common stock through the ESPP at an average exercise price of $22.23 and $19.21 per share, respectively.

Note 12.
The adjustments made in the first quarter of 2018 were not material.
Because of the complexities of the new provisions, the Company is continuing to evaluate how the provisions will be accounted for under U.S. GAAP.
Companies are allowed to make an accounting policy election of either (i) account for GILTI as a component of income tax expense in the period in which the Company is subject to the rules (the “period cost method”), or (ii) account for GILTI in the Company’s measurement of deferred taxes (the “deferred method”).
The Company has not elected a method and will do so after completing its analysis of the GILTI provisions of the Tax Act depending on the analysis of the Company’s global income.
Therefore, the Company has not recorded any potential deferred tax effects related to the GILTI in its financial statements and has no policy election regarding whether to record deferred taxes on GILTI or use the period cost method.
The Company has however, included an estimate of the current GILTI impact in its annual effective tax rate for 2018.
The Company expects to complete the accounting during the measurement period.
The rate for the period includes a discrete benefit of 4.4% primarily related to the net impact of unrecognized tax benefits.
As of March 31, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $263.1 million.
