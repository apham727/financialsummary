1.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION



The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
GAAP”) for complete financial statements.
We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries.
These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 26, 2017.
The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods.
The results of operations for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2018.
On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity.
As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist.
In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders.
Allowances for Client Receivables and Unbilled Services



As of May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017, total allowances recorded for client receivables and unbilled services were $56,653 and $74,450, respectively.
Depreciation and Amortization



Depreciation expense was $101,814 and $315,410 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, and $86,148 and $255,807 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively.
As of May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017, total accumulated depreciation was $2,028,174 and $1,912,146, respectively.
Deferred transition amortization expense was $95,696 and $248,838 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, and $66,634 and $205,763 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively.
See Note 5 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) for intangible asset amortization balances.

EARNINGS PER SHARE



Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



_______________



(1)Diluted earnings per share assumes the exchange of all Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis and the redemption of all Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares owned by holders of noncontrolling interests prior to March 13, 2018, when these were redeemed for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.
The income effect does not take into account “Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests - other,” since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.

See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) for additional information on Accenture Holdings plc.
The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.
7.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS



In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.
Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts.
Cash Flow Hedges



For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized.
For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 3 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Derivatives



Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $84,480 and $37,698 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, and a net gain of $89,035 and a net loss of $29,279 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively.
Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments



The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction.
In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value.
The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements was as follows:

Plan participants elected to receive either a lump-sum distribution or to transfer benefits to a third-party annuity provider.
The charge primarily consisted of unrecognized actuarial losses of $460,908 previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
In connection with the settlement, we made a $118,500 cash contribution ($48,885 related to additional actuarial losses and $69,615 to fund previously recorded pension liabilities).

Due to the recent enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we have recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements.
In the three months ended February 28, 2018, we recognized a provisional tax expense of $136,724 primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new, lower rates.
As we collect and analyze data, including our forecast of when we expect to realize certain deferred tax amounts, we may adjust the provisional amounts.
In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs.
Our effective tax rates for the three months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 were 34.4% and 19.4%, respectively.
Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 were 27.2% and 20.2%, respectively.
Absent the pension settlement charge (see Note 8 Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) and related tax impact recorded during the three months ended May 31, 2017, the effective tax rates would have been 26.6% and 22.7% for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final determinations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018.
10.
For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above.
We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world.
