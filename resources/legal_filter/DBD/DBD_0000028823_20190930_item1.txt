 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
The Company has reclassified the presentation of certain prior-year information to conform to the current presentation. 
The Company utilizes lease agreements to meet its operating needs. These leases support global staff via the use of office space, warehouses, vehicles and information technology (IT) equipment. The Company utilizes both operating and finance leases in its portfolio of leased assets, however, the majority of these leases are classified as operating. A significant portion of the volume of the lease portfolio is in fleet vehicles and IT office equipment; however, real estate leases constitute a majority of the value of the ROU assets. Lease agreements are utilized worldwide, with the largest location concentration in the United States, Germany and India.
•The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed the Company to carry forward its ASC 840 assessment regarding definition of a lease, lease classification and initial direct costs.
•The practical expedient related to land easements is not applicable as the Company currently does not utilize any easements. 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
•The Company declined the hindsight practical expedient to determine the lease term and ROU asset impairment for existing leases. The decision to decline the hindsight practical expedient resulted in relying on assessments made under ASC 840 during transition and re-assessing under ASC 842 going forward. 
•The Company declined the short-term lease exception, therefore recognizing all leases in the ROU asset and lease liability balances. Consistent with ASC 842 requirements, leases that are one month or less are not included in the balance.
The weighted-average discount rates used for operating and finance leases varies due to the jurisdictional composition. The Company has an immaterial amount of finance leases that are primarily comprised of leases in Turkey which have higher interest rates.
Certain lease agreements include payments based on a variety of global indexes or rates. These payment amounts have been projected using the index or rate as of lease commencement or the transition date and measured in ROU assets and lease liabilities. Other leases contain variable payments that are based on actual usage of the underlying assets and, therefore, are not measured in assets or liabilities as the variable payments are not based on an index or a rate. For real estate leases, these payments are most often tied to non-committed maintenance or utilities charges, and for equipment leases, to actual output or hours in operation. These amounts typically become known when the invoice is received, which is when expense is recognized. In rare circumstances, the Company's lease agreements may contain residual value guarantees. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any restrictions or covenants, such as those relating to dividends or incurring additional financial obligations.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
As of September 30, 2019, the Company did not have any material leases that have not yet commenced but that create significant rights and obligations.
The Company determines whether an arrangement is or includes a lease at contract inception. All contracts containing the right to use an underlying asset are reviewed to confirm that the contract meets the definition of a lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date and initially measured based on the present value of lease payments over the defined lease term.
As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. In order to apply the incremental borrowing rate, a rate table was developed to assign the appropriate rate to each lease based on lease term and currency of payments. For leases with large numbers of underlying assets, a portfolio approach with a collateralized rate was utilized. Assets were grouped based on similar lease terms and economic environments in a manner whereby the Company reasonably expects that the application does not differ materially from a lease-by-lease approach.

The effective tax rate on the loss before taxes was (22.3) percent for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and (8.5) percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The expense on the loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge, the impacts of the Tax Act and the higher interest expense burden resulting from the debt restructuring. More specifically, the expense on the loss reflects refinement of the transition tax, the impacts related to GILTI and the business interest deduction limitation which, as a result of the Company’s debt restructuring activities during the third quarter of 2018, required a full valuation allowance on the current year nondeductible business interest expense. In addition, the benefit on the losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was reduced by the goodwill impairment charge, which for tax purposes is primarily nondeductible, of $134.4 and $83.1 incurred in the third and second quarters of 2018, respectively. 
The Company has deferred compensation plans that enable certain employees to defer receipt of a portion of their cash, 401(k) or share-based compensation and non-employee directors to defer receipt of director fees at the participants’ discretion. For deferred cash-based compensation, the Company established rabbi trusts (refer to note 18), which are recorded at fair value of the underlying

Securities and other investments also includes a cash surrender value of insurance contracts of $8.1 and $11.1 as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to death benefits paid. In addition, it includes an interest rate swap asset carrying value of $0.4 and $4.8 as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which also represents fair value (refer to note 18).
In May 2017, the Company announced a strategic partnership with Kony, a leading enterprise mobility and application company, to offer white label mobile application solutions for financial institutions and retailers. In September 2019, the Company's interest in Kony was sold for cash proceeds of $21.3. The Company's carrying value in Kony was $14.0, resulting in a gain of $7.3.
The Company provides financing arrangements to customers purchasing its products. These financing arrangements are largely classified and accounted for as sales-type leases.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
There were no significant changes in provision for credit losses, recoveries and write-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. As of September 30, 2019, finance leases and notes receivable individually evaluated for impairment were $33.4 and $4.8, respectively, with no provision recorded. As of September 30, 2018, finance leases and notes receivable individually evaluated for impairment were $30.5 and $10.8, respectively. There have been no material changes to the balances on the finance lease receivables maturity schedule since December 31, 2018. The income related to the finance lease receivables was minimal for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
The Company records interest income and any fees or costs related to financing receivables using the effective interest method over the term of the lease or loan. The Company reviews the aging of its financing receivables to determine past due and delinquent accounts. Credit quality is reviewed at inception and is re-evaluated as needed based on customer-specific circumstances. Receivable balances 60 days to 89 days past due are reviewed and may be placed on nonaccrual status based on customer-specific circumstances. Receivable balances are placed on nonaccrual status upon reaching greater than 89 days past due. Upon receipt of payment on nonaccrual financing receivables, interest income is recognized and accrual of interest is resumed once the account has been made current or the specific circumstances have been resolved.

The Company has qualified retirement plans covering certain U.S. employees that have been closed to new participants since 2003 and frozen since December 2013. Plans that cover salaried employees provide retirement benefits based on an employee’s compensation during the ten years before the date of the plan freeze or the date of the employee's actual separation from service, if earlier. The Company’s funding policy for salaried plans is to contribute annually based on actuarial projections and applicable regulations. Plans covering hourly employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service. The Company’s funding policy for hourly plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by applicable regulations.
The Company has non-qualified pension plans to provide supplemental retirement benefits to certain officers, which have also been frozen since December 2013. Benefits are payable at retirement based upon a percentage of the participant’s compensation, as defined. In addition to providing retirement benefits, the Company provides post-employment healthcare and life insurance benefits (referred to as other benefits) for certain retired employees. Retired eligible employees in the United States may be entitled to these benefits based upon years of service with the Company, age at retirement and collective bargaining agreements. There are no plan assets and the Company funds the benefits as the claims are paid. The post-employment benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and life insurance plans together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates.
The Company also has defined benefit plans in Germany and Switzerland, among others. In Germany, post-employment benefit plans are set up as employer funded pension plans and deferred compensation plans. The employer funded pension commitments in Germany are based upon direct performance-related commitments in terms of defined contribution plans. Each beneficiary receives, depending on individual pay-scale grouping, contractual classification or income level, different yearly contributions. The contribution is multiplied by an age factor appropriate to the respective pension plan and credited to the individual retirement account of the employee. The retirement accounts may be used up at retirement by either a one-time lump-sum payout or payments of up to ten years. Insured events include disability, death and reaching of retirement age. In Switzerland, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The employees receive their pension payments as a function of contributions paid, a fixed interest rate and annuity factors. Insured events are disability, death and reaching of retirement age.

Cash Flow Hedges The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. The Company estimates that a minimal amount will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense over the next year.
The Company has an interest rate swap for a nominal sum of €50.0, which was entered into in May 2010, with a ten-year term from October 1, 2010 until September 30, 2020.

The Company has challenged multiple customs rulings in Thailand seeking to retroactively collect customs duties on previous imports of automated teller machines (ATMs). In August 2017 and March 2019, the Supreme Court of Thailand ruled in the Company's favor in two of the matters, finding that Thailand customs' attempt to collect duties for importation of ATMs was improper. The surviving matters remain at various stages of the appeals process and the Company will use the Supreme Court's decisions in support of its position in those matters. Management remains confident that the Company has a valid legal position in these appeals. Accordingly, the Company does not have any amount accrued for this contingency.

Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations
As of September 30, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $1,700. The Company generally expects to recognize revenue on the remaining performance obligations over the next twelve months.

The Company applies the practical expedient in ASC paragraph 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. 
Each guarantor subsidiary is 100 percent owned by the Parent Company at the date of each balance sheet presented. The 2024 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each guarantor subsidiary. The guarantees of the guarantor subsidiaries are subject to release in limited circumstances only upon the occurrence of certain conditions. Each entity in the consolidating financial information follows the same accounting policies as described in the condensed consolidated financial statements, except for the use by the Parent Company and the guarantor subsidiaries of the equity method of accounting to reflect ownership interests in subsidiaries which are eliminated upon consolidation. Changes in intercompany receivables and payables related to operations, such as intercompany sales or service charges, are included in cash flows from operating activities. Intercompany transactions reported as investing or financing activities include the sale of capital stock of various subsidiaries, loans and other capital transactions between members of the consolidated group.
