The Company’s operating structure is focused on its two customer segments — Banking and Retail. Leveraging a broad portfolio of solutions, the Company offers its clients the flexibility to purchase the combination of services, software and systems that drive the most value to their business. 
For example, the Company offers end-to-end branch and store automation solutions that consist of the complete value chain of consult, design, build and operate. Branch and store automation helps financial institutions and retailers grow revenue, reduce costs, and increase convenience and security for their customers by migrating routine transactions, typically done inside the branch or store, to lower-cost automated channels. The Company collaborates with its clients to define the ideal customer experience, modify processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technologies that meet business objectives.
The Company provides integrated solutions for financial institutions of all sizes designed to help drive operational efficiencies, differentiate the consumer experience, grow revenue and manage risk. Banking operations are managed within two geographic regions. The Eurasia region includes the developed economies of Western Europe as well as the emerging economies of Eastern Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The Americas region encompasses the United States (U.S.), Canada, Mexico, Central and South America.
For banking clients, services represents the largest operational component of the Company. Diebold Nixdorf AllConnect ServicesSM was launched in 2018 to power the business operations of financial institutions of all sizes. This as-a-service offering provides financial institutions with the capabilities and technology needed to make physical distribution channels as agile, integrated, efficient and differentiated as their digital counterparts by leveraging a data-driven Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure. The Company’s product-related services resolve incidents through remote service capabilities or an on-site visit. The portfolio includes first and second line maintenance, preventive maintenance, “on-demand” and total implementation services. 
Managed services and outsourcing consists of managing the end-to-end business processes, technology integration and day-to-day operation of the self-service channel and the bank branch. Our integrated business solutions include self-service fleet management, branch life-cycle management and ATM as-a-service capabilities.
From a product perspective, the banking portfolio consists of cash recyclers and dispensers, intelligent deposit terminals, teller automation and kiosk technologies, as well as physical security solutions. The Company assists financial institutions to increase the functionality, availability and security within their ATM fleet. 
Earlier in the year, the Company introduced the DN Series of ATMs, a family of self-service solutions designed to anticipate the needs of a progressively transforming industry. These holistic, digitally-connected solutions are built upon an integrated software and services model and provided a modern and personalized experience for consumers, while delivering maximum efficiency and reliability for financial institutions.
The Company’s software encompasses front-end applications for consumer connection points as well as back-end platforms which manage channel transactions, operations and channel integration. These hardware-agnostic software 
applications facilitate millions of transactions via ATMs, kiosks, and other self-service devices, as well as via online and mobile digital channels. 
The Company's DN Vynamic software is the first end-to-end Connected Commerce software portfolio in the banking marketplace designed to simplify and enhance the consumer experience. In addition, DN Vynamic suite's open application program interface (API) architecture is built to simplify operations by eliminating the traditional focus on internal silos and enabling tomorrow's inter-connected partnerships between financial institutions and payment providers. In addition, with a shared analytic and transaction engine, the DN Vynamic platform can generate new insights to enhance operations across any channel — putting consumer preferences, not the technology, at the heart of the experience. 
An important enabler of the Company’s software offerings are the professional service employees who provide systems integration, customization, project management and consulting. The Company's advisory services team collaborates with customers to refine the end-user experience, improve business processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technology to automate both branches and stores.
The Company’s comprehensive portfolio of retail solutions, software and services improves the checkout process for retailers while enhancing shopping experiences for consumers.
•Realization of cost reductions, which leverage the Company's global scale, reduce overlap and improve operating efficiencies.
Services gross margin increased 5.1 percent and 3.5 percent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. Both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were favorably impacted by lower restructuring charges of $2.8 and $0.4, respectively, and lower non-routine charges of $0.8 and $2.4, respectively. Excluding restructuring and non-routine charges, services gross margin increased 5.5 percent and 3.6 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, as services margin increased in the Eurasia banking segment related to the favorable impact of the services modernization initiatives and favorable mix of higher margin installation activity. The nine months ended September 30, 2018, was unfavorably impacted by one-time banking services cost in Brazil.
Product gross margin increased 4.2 percent and 3.9 percent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. Both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were favorably impacted by lower restructuring charges of $3.8 and $3.9, respectively. Both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were favorably impacted by lower non-routine charges of $5.7 and $19.0, respectively, primarily related to lower purchase accounting amortization and gain on a product inventory provision, partially offset by the reversal of a Brazil indirect tax accrual in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding the impact of restructuring and non-routine charges, products gross margin increased 2.0 percent and 2.1 percent in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher volume and a more favorable solution mix in Brazil and Canada along with higher margin Windows 10 upgrades in parts of Europe. Additionally, product gross margin improved from the Company's focus on higher margin product mix in Eurasia and Latin America as well as improved supply chain management and lower expedited freight costs in the Americas.
Selling and administrative expense increased in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 by $1.9 and $4.5, respectively. Excluding lower incremental restructuring of $22.2 and lower non-routine charges of $0.8, the three months ended September 30, 2019 expense increase $24.2. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, excluding lower incremental 
restructuring of $19.6 and higher non-routine charges of $16.4, the expense increased $7.0. The increase in selling and administrative expense for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 is primarily attributable to an increase in annual incentive plan cost and an unfavorable impact of the mark-to-market adjustment of the legacy Wincor Nixdorf stock option program partially offset by the cost reduction initiatives tied to the DN Now program.
Non-routine cost in selling and administrative expense was $34.5 and $126.3 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, a decrease of $0.8 and and an increase of $16.4, respectively, compared to the prior-year periods. The lower non-routine costs in the three months ended September 30, 2019 consisted of lower integration expense and purchase accounting adjustments partially offset by increased DN Now transformation expense. The nine months ended September 30, 2019 consisted of increased DN Now transformation expense, a one-time non-cash item in Brazil and $5.6 related to the German real estate tax from the squeeze out in the first quarter of 2019. These increases were partially offset by lower integration expense and purchase accounting adjustments. Selling and administrative expense included restructuring charges of $6.4 and $13.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, or $22.2 and $19.6, respectively, lower than the prior-year periods, related to the workforce alignment under the DN Now plan.
Research, development and engineering expense in the three months ended September 30, 2019 decreased $0.2 including a net favorable currency impact of $0.9, primarily related to the euro. In the nine months ended September 30, 2019, research, development and engineering expense decreased $9.1 including a net favorable currency impact of $4.7. Excluding the impact of currency, research, development and engineering expense decreased $1.1 and $13.8, respectively, due primarily to lower headcount tied to the Company’s DN Now restructuring program, partially offset by increased software development cost.
In the three months ended September 30, 2019, the gain on sale of assets primarily relates to the Kony transaction. The nine months ended September 30, 2019 included the loss of the Venezuela business and losses from the divestiture and liquidation of non-core businesses in Eurasia. The gain of $6.8 in the prior-year period was primarily related to the sale of a building in North America and the liquidation of the Barbados operating entity.
The operating profit increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. The change is primarily due to higher product gross profit in the Americas and Eurasia banking segments from large roll out and upgrade projects and the higher impairment charges in 2018, partially offset by the increase in the loss on sale of assets in 2019.
The loss before taxes and net loss decreased primarily due to the reasons described above. Net loss was also impacted by the change in the income tax expense.
The effective tax rate on the loss from continuing operations was (17.2) percent for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and (50.8) percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The expense on the loss was primarily due to the tax impacts of the Tax Act on the estimated projected tax rate, more specifically, the impacts related to GILTI and BEAT. In addition, during the first quarter the Company collapsed its Barbados structure to meet the covenant requirements under its credit agreement, which resulted in additional discrete tax expense of $48.4 inclusive of the offsetting valuation allowance release relating to the Company’s nondeductible interest expense that was carried forward from December 31, 2018. No taxes are currently payable related to the collapse of the Barbados structure. The above items noted as well as the Company’s jurisdictional income (loss) mix and varying statutory rates are the primary drivers of the estimated projected tax rate. 
The effective tax rate on the loss before taxes was (22.3) percent for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and (8.5) percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The expense on the loss for the three months ended and nine months ended was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge, the impacts of the Tax Act and the higher interest expense burden resulting from the debt restructuring. More specifically, the expense on the loss reflects refinement of the transition tax, the impacts related to GILTI and the business interest deduction limitation which, as a result of the Company’s debt restructuring activities during the quarter, required a full valuation allowance on the current year nondeductible business interest expense. In addition, the benefit on the losses for the nine months is reduced by the goodwill impairment charge, which for tax purposes is primarily nondeductible, of $134.4 and $83.1 incurred in the third and second quarter, respectively. 
Segment operating profit decreased $2.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2019 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $2.2. Excluding the impact of currency, operating profit decreased $0.4 for the three months September 30, 2019 related to lower project volume. Segment operating profit increased $32.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $9.1, primarily due to the euro. Excluding the impact of currency, operating profit increased $41.3 for the nine months September 30, 2019 due in part to higher gross margins on services and products as well as lower selling and administrative expenses. The favorable services margin was primarily attributable to the services modernization program which benefited numerous countries in Europe and Asia, while products margin also benefited from DN Now initiatives, higher volume as well as favorable country and product mix. Additionally, segment operating profit benefited from lower operating expenses tied to DN Now initiatives, restructuring programs and the phase out of non-profitable service contracts in India.
For the three months ended September 30, 2019, Americas Banking net sales increased $21.2, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $0.4 related to the Canada dollar and Brazil real. Excluding currency and the impact of a small divestiture, net sales increased $22.4 primarily due to increased product volume and related service installation revenue from unit replacements from Windows 10 upgrades in Brazil, Mexico and Canada slightly offset by lower maintenance revenue in the U.S. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, Americas Banking net sales increased $99.5, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $9.5 related to the Brazil real. Excluding currency and a small divestiture, net sales increased $112.0 driven primarily by product sales in Canada, Brazil, Mexico and the U.S regional customers related to unit replacements from Windows 10 upgrades. Partially offsetting the increases, services revenue declined from lower maintenance contract volume and billed work activity in the U.S.
Segment operating profit increased $27.2 and $76.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, mostly from DN Now initiatives favorably impacting both cost of sales and operating expense. Gross profit was favorably impacted by current large product refresh projects in Canada and favorable solution mix in the U.S., Brazil and Latin America. Additionally, the Company made improvements to supply chain management resulting in lower expedited freight costs. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were unfavorably impacted by one-time banking services cost in Brazil. 
Segment operating profit margin decreased 1.1 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2019 primarily related to lower product volume. Segment operating profit increased 0.6 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily from lower costs and expenses tied to DN Now initiatives as well as higher volume and favorable service mix related to maintenance and support activities in Europe.
Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring and integration activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, a decrease in use of $379.5 from $372.1 for the same period in 2018.
•Cash flows from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 were impacted by a $216.5 decrease in net loss inclusive of the 2018 non-cash goodwill impairment of $217.5. Refer to the Results of Operations discussed above for further discussion of the Company's net loss.
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $15.3 to $171.3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $186.6 during the same period in 2018 primarily due to a reduction in capital spend. Share-based compensation decreased $7.8 to $19.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to a reduction in shares awarded in 2019.
The maturities and purchases of investments primarily relate to short-term investment activity in Brazil. The $79.9 change was primarily due to the monetization of the Company's investment in the company owned life insurance plans in the third quarter of 2018 and a reduction in utilization of short-term investments in Brazil for cash needs as well as a reduction in the Company's capital spend.
