Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Net Sales
Three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with three months ended March 31, 2017 
Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Gross Profit
Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Systems gross margin in the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased primarily as a result of higher purchase accounting adjustments in the prior year of $14.5 and the current year benefit from Brazil indirect tax accrual reversal of $3.7. Deferred Revenue Adjustments included a $5.2 prior year reduction of revenue and $9.3 higher asset amortization.
Operating Expenses
Non-routine costs in selling and administrative expense of $38.5 and $49.1 were included in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The primary components of the non-routine expenses in the first quarter 2018 pertained to purchase accounting adjustments of $23.8 related to intangible asset amortization and integration costs totaling $14.2. Selling and administrative expense included restructuring charges of $1.3 and $8.4 in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In the three months ended March 31, 2018, the gain on sale of assets was primarily related to the sale of a building in North America of $4.5 and the liquidation of the Barbados operating entity of $3.3. 
Operating expense as a percent of net sales in the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 24.6 percent compared with 26.4 percent in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease is related primarily to lower restructuring and non-routine expense inclusive of the previously mentioned gain on sale of a building in North America.
Operating Profit
The operating loss decreased in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due primarily from decreased operating expenses as a result of lower non-routine and restructuring charges.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
The decrease in interest income in the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, was the result of lower average balances and reduced current period rates of short-term investments in Brazil. Interest expense was lower in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same prior-year period due to the favorable impact of refinancing the debt related to the Acquisition. Foreign exchange loss in the three-month period was primarily due to the strengthening of the euro compared to the prior year period.
Net Income (Loss)
Net loss was $63.3 and $52.2 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to the reasons described above and the change in income tax (benefit) expense.
The effective tax rate on the net loss was 30.2 percent for the three months ended 2017. Companies are required to apply their estimated annual tax rate on a year-to-date basis in each interim period. Companies should not apply the estimated annual tax rate to interim financial results if the estimated annual tax rate is not reliably predictable. In this situation, the interim tax rate should be based on the actual year-to-date results. As of March, 31, 2017, the Company was not able to reasonably estimate the annual effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2017, because small fluctuations in the Company's earnings before taxes could have resulted in a material change in the estimated annual tax rate. For this reason, the Company did not believe the estimated annual tax rate would provide a reliable estimate and as a result, the Company computed the interim tax rate based on the actual year-to-date results. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily a result of the jurisdictional income (loss) mix and varying statutory rates in the Company's global footprint.
