The Company’s operating structure is focused on its two customer segments - Banking and Retail. Leveraging a broad portfolio of solutions, the Company offers customers the flexibility to purchase the combination of services, software and systems that drive the most value to their business. 
For example, the Company offers end-to-end branch and store automation solutions that consist of the complete value chain of consult, design, build and operate. Branch and store automation helps financial institutions and retailers grow revenue, reduce costs, and increase convenience and security for their customers by migrating routine transactions, typically done inside the branch or store, to lower-cost automated channels. The Company’s advisory services team collaborates with its clients to define the ideal customer experience, modify processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technologies that meet business objectives.
The Company provides integrated solutions for financial institutions of all sizes designed to help drive operational efficiencies, differentiate the consumer experience, grow revenue and manage risk. Banking operations are managed within two geographic regions. The Eurasia region includes the developed economies of Western Europe as well as the emerging economies of Eastern Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The Americas region encompasses the United States (U.S.), Canada, Mexico and Latin America.
For banking clients, services represents the largest operational component of the Company. Diebold Nixdorf AllConnect Services was launched in 2018 to power the business operations of financial institutions of all sizes. This as-a-service offering provides financial institutions with the capabilities and technology needed to make physical distribution channels as agile, integrated, efficient and differentiated as their digital counterparts by leveraging a data-driven Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure. The Company’s product-related services resolve incidents through remote service capabilities or an on-site visit. The portfolio includes first and second line maintenance, preventive maintenance, “on-demand” and total implementation services. 
Managed services and outsourcing consists of managing the end-to-end business processes, technology integration and day-to-day operation of the self-service channel and the bank branch. Our integrated business solutions include self-service fleet management, branch life-cycle management and ATM as-a-service capabilities.
From a product perspective, the banking portfolio consists of cash recyclers and dispensers, intelligent deposit terminals, teller automation and kiosk technologies, as well as physical security solutions. The Company assists financial institutions to increase the functionality, availability and security within their ATM fleet. 
The Company’s software encompasses front-end applications for consumer connection points as well as back-end platforms which manage channel transactions, operations and integration. These hardware-agnostic software applications facilitate millions of transactions via ATMs, kiosks, and other self-service devices, as well as via online and mobile digital channels. 
In 2017, the Company introduced DN Vynamic™ Software, the first end-to-end Connected Commerce software portfolio in the banking marketplace designed to simplify and enhance the consumer experience. In addition, DN Vynamic suite's open application program interface (API) architecture is built to simplify operations by eliminating the traditional focus on internal silos and enabling tomorrow's inter-connected partnerships between financial institutions and payment providers. In addition, with a shared analytic and transaction engine, the DN Vynamic platform can generate new insights to enhance operations across any channel - putting consumer preferences, not the technology, at the heart of the experience. 
An important enabler of the Company’s software offerings is the professional service employees who provide systems integration, customization, project management and consulting. The Company's advisory services team collaborates with customers to refine the end-user experience, improve business processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technology to automate both branches and stores.

Net Sales
Three months ended March 31, 2019 compared with three months ended March 31, 2018 
Operating Expenses
Selling and administrative expense in the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased $0.4 including higher incremental restructuring of $0.9 and non-routine charges of $6.1. Excluding the impact of restructuring, non-routine charges and a net favorable currency impact of $8.9, mostly related to the euro, selling and administrative expense increased $2.3, primarily from higher 
expense related to the mark-to-market adjustment of the legacy Wincor Nixdorf stock option program of $6.4 in addition to higher U.S. based associate related expense. These increases are mostly offset by cost reduction initiatives and restructuring programs across the segments tied to the DN Now program.
Non-routine cost in selling and administrative expense was $44.5 in the three months ended March 31, 2019, an increase of $6.1 compared to the prior year. Higher non-routine cost consisted of increased legal and consulting expense of $20.5 inclusive of $5.6 related to the squeeze out real estate tax, and $3.0 related to a one-time non-cash accounts receivable discount in Brazil. These increases were partially offset by lower integration expense of $14.6 and purchase accounting adjustments of $2.6. Selling and administrative expense included restructuring charges of $2.2, or $0.9 higher than the prior year, related to the workforce alignment under the DN Now plan.
Loss of $3.4 on sale of assets recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2019 includes the loss on divestitures of the Venezuela business of $4.1 and a Eurasia non-core business of $2.8, partially offset by a gain on the liquidation of a separate Eurasia non-core business of $3.5. The gain of $7.7 in the prior year was primarily related to the sale of a building in North America of $4.5 and the liquidation of the Barbados operating entity of $3.3.
Operating Loss
The operating loss increased in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.8, related primarily to the euro and higher non-routine charges. Excluding the impact of currency and non-routine charges, operating profit increased $13.0 primarily related to higher product gross profit in the Americas and Eurasia banking segments from large roll out and upgrade projects.
Other Income (Expense)
Interest income in the three months ended March 31, 2019 decreased $0.6 compared with the same period in 2018, primarily as a result of overall lower average investment balances in Brazil. Interest expense increased $24.9 compared to the same prior-year 
period due to the acquisition of the additional $650.0 of Term Loan A-1 Facility debt with higher incremental interest rates and related fee amortization. Foreign exchange gain increased $4.2 primarily as a result of the currency devaluation in Venezuela operating entity in the current year. Miscellaneous net, decreased $1.3 in the three months ended March 31, 2019, unfavorably impacted by higher costs and lower benefits associated with the company owned life insurance.
Net Loss
The loss before taxes and net loss increased primarily due to the reasons described above. Net loss was also impacted by the change in the income tax expense.
The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations was (85.0) percent for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The expense on the loss is due primarily to the tax impacts of the Tax Act on the estimated projected tax rate. More specifically, the impacts of the GILTI and BEAT. In addition, the Company collapsed its Barbados structure to meet the debt covenant requirements from our lenders during the quarter which resulted in additional discrete tax expense which is being offset in part by the valuation allowance release relating to the Company’s nondeductible interest expense resulting in no additional cash taxes. The above items noted as well as the Company’s jurisdictional income (loss) mix and varying respective statutory rates are the primary drivers of the quarterly tax rate. 
The effective tax rate on the net loss was (40.4) percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The expense on the loss is due primarily from impacts related to GILTI on the estimated annual tax rate.
Segment Net Sales and Operating Profit Summary
Segment operating profit increased $14.2 in the three months ended March 31, 2019, including a net unfavorable currency impact of $4.5, primarily due to the euro. Excluding the impact of currency, operating profit increased $18.7 due in part to higher gross profit on services and products margin improvements. The favorable services margin was primarily attributable to the services modernization program which benefited numerous countries in Europe and Asia, while products margin also benefited from DN 
Now initiatives as well as higher volume in Germany. Additionally, segment operating profit benefited from lower operating expenses tied to DN Now initiatives, restructuring programs and the phase out of non-profitable service contracts in India.
Americas Banking net sales increased $29.0 including a net unfavorable currency impact of $5.9 related to the Brazil real. Excluding currency, net sales increased $34.9 primarily due to increased installation volume in Canada and the U.S. as well as improved supply chain management in North America. Increased products volume in the Latin America distributor business, Chile and Ecuador drove higher revenue as well as software license volume in Brazil. Partially offsetting these increases, services revenue declined from lower billed work activity and maintenance contract volume in the U.S.
Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring and integration activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows. Net cash used by operating activities was $57.1 for the three months ended March 31, 2019, a decrease in use of $85.2 from $142.3 for the same period in 2018.
•Cash flows from operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 were impacted by a $66.3 increase in net loss. Refer to the Results of Operations discussed above for further discussion of the Company's net loss.
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $6.0 to $58.4 during the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $64.4 during the same period in 2018 primarily due to a reduction in capital spend. Share-based compensation decreased $4.4 to $9.3 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to a reduction in shares awarded in 2019.
Investing Activities
The maturities and purchases of investments primarily relate to short-term investment activity in Brazil. The $44.7 change was primarily due to a reduction in utilization of short-term investments in Brazil for cash needs.
Financing Activities
Net cash used by financing activities was $13.9 and $91.4 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $77.5. The change was primarily due a decrease in net borrowings (repayments) under the Company's revolving facility and the reduction in dividend payments. The decreases in use were partially offset by $10.5 in higher cash distributions related to the redemption of shares and cash compensation to Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders of $11.0 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $0.5 in the prior-year period.
Refer to note 11 for additional information regarding the Company's debt obligations. As defined by the Company's credit agreement, the ratio of net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA was 5.7 times as of March 31, 2019.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various arrangements not recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets that have or could have an effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
In addition to the items that the Company disclosed as its critical accounting policies and estimates in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, the company adopted ASU 2016-02 and its subsequent amendments related to lease accounting. The standard requires that a lessee recognize on its balance sheet right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities resulting from leasing transactions, as well as additional financial statement disclosures. Previously, U.S. GAAP only required balance sheet recognition for leases classified as capital leases. The provisions of this update apply to substantially all leased assets. Subsequent ASUs related to this standard are updates, which prescribe a practical expedient for implementation and narrow-scope improvements for lessors. For more information regarding the implementation of this standard, refer to note 2.
