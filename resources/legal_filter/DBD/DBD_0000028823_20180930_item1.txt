The Company includes a warranty in connection with certain contracts with customers, which are not considered to be separate performance obligations. The Company provides its customers a manufacturer’s warranty and records, at the time of the sale, a corresponding estimated liability for potential warranty costs. For additional information on product warranty refer to note 9. The Company also has extended warranty and service contracts available for its customers, which are recognized as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized on these contracts ratably as the Company has a stand-ready obligation to provide services when or as needed by the customer. This input method is the most accurate assessment of progress toward completion the Company can apply.
Nature of goods and services 
The following is a description of principal solutions offered within the Company's two main industry segments that generate the Company's revenue. For more detailed information about reportable operating segments, see note 20.
The Company provides its banking customers product-related services which include proactive monitoring and rapid resolution of incidents through remote service capabilities or an on-site visit. First and second line maintenance, preventive maintenance and on-demand services keep the distributed assets of the Company's customers up and running through a standardized incident management process. Managed services and outsourcing consists of the end-to-end business processes, solution management, upgrades and transaction processing. The Company also provides a full array of cash management services, which optimizes the availability and cost of physical currency across the enterprise through efficient forecasting, inventory and replenishment processes.
Banking and retail services may be sold separately or in bundled packages. The typical contract length for service is generally one year and is billed and paid in advance except for installations, among others. 
The Company's hardware-agnostic software applications facilitate millions of transactions via automated teller machines (ATMs), point of sale (POS) terminals, kiosks, and other self-service devices. The Company provides its banking customers front-end applications for consumer connection points and back-end platforms that manage channel transactions, operations and integration. For its retail customers, the Company provides a comprehensive, modular solution capable of enabling the most advanced omnichannel retail use cases. The Company's platform software is installed within bank and retail data centers to facilitate omnichannel transactions, endpoint monitoring, remote asset management, customer marketing, merchandise management and analytics. These offerings include highly configurable, application program interface (API) enabled software that automates legacy banking transactions across channels.
The Company’s software solution includes its professional services team, who provides systems integration, customization, consulting and project management. The Company’s advisory services team collaborates with its customers to help define optimal user experience, improve business processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technology to meet branch and store automation objectives.
The Company considered ASC 606-10-32-34(c)(2), which provides the criteria that "the entity has not yet established a price for that good or service, and the good or service has not previously been sold on a standalone basis (that is, the selling price is uncertain)." The Company considers software as capable of being distinct, although it generally is not distinct in the context of 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
the contract. Since the Company generally does not sell its software on a stand-alone basis there is limited history to accurately establish a stand-alone selling price. The Company does not have an established standalone selling price for its software.
Additionally, the Company considers the customization of the intellectual property significant since the professional services integrate the commercial solution with the customer's existing infrastructure. Although the services are capable of being distinct, they are not distinct within the context of the contract. The Company concluded this fully integrated commercial solution is inseparable since its customers generally only benefit from the combined output, which includes both the intellectual property and the professional services. The percentage of the Company's consolidated net sales recognized from integration and customization of software represented approximately one percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
The Company allocates price between products and software net sales when hardware is sold. Hardware sales include operating system software that is required for the hardware to function. The Company generally allocates revenue using the residual method for software included in hardware sales.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
The Company evaluates on a contract by contract basis software license sales that are standalone and software license sales that are accounted for under the residual method, but does not aggregate such sales. Software net sales using the residual approach represented approximately two percent of the Company's total consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Contract assets are minimal for the periods presented. The amount of revenue recognized in 2018 from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, mainly due to the changes in the estimate of variable consideration and contract modifications was de minimis. There have been $9.7 and $11.5 during the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $20.6 and $26.3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of impairment losses recognized as bad debt related to receivables or contract assets arising from the Company's contracts with customers.
As of January 1, 2018, the Company had $437.5 of unrecognized deferred revenue constituting the remaining performance obligations that are either unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied). In 2018, the Company recognized revenue of $241.4 related to the Company's deferred revenue balance at January 1, 2018.
The contract assets are reclassified into the receivables balance when the rights to receive payment become unconditional. Contract liabilities are recorded for any services billed to customers and not yet recognizable if the contract period has commenced or for the amount collected from customers in advance of the contract period commencing. In addition, contract liabilities are recorded as advanced payments for products and other deliverables that are billed to and collected from customers prior to revenue being recognizable.
Transaction price and variable consideration
The Company also applies the ‘as invoiced’ practical expedient in paragraph 606-10-55-18 related to performance obligations satisfied over time, which permits the Company to recognize revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice the customer if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date. Service revenues that are recognized ratably are primarily contracts that include first and second line maintenance. Service revenues that are recognized using input measures include primarily preventative maintenance. The ‘as invoiced’ practical expedient relates to the on-demand service revenue which is generally not under contract.
Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations
As of September 30, 2018, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $2,900. The Company expects to recognize revenue on the remaining performance obligations over the next twelve months. The Company enters into service agreements with cancellable terms after a certain period without penalty. Unsatisfied obligations reflect only the obligation during the initial term. The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. 
The Company also applies the ‘as invoiced’ practical expedient in paragraph 606-10-55-18 related to performance obligations satisfied over time which permits the Company to recognize revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice the customer if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date. Service revenues that are recognized ratably are primarily contracts that include first and second line maintenance. Service revenues that are recognized using input measures include primarily preventative maintenance. The ‘as invoiced’ practical expedient relates to the on-demand service revenue, which is generally not under contract.

Changes in accounting policies
Except for the changes below, the Company has consistently applied the accounting policies to all periods presented in these condensed consolidated financial statements.
The Company adopted Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, with a date of initial application of January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed below. 
The Company applied Topic 606 using the cumulative effect method - i.e., by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying Topic 606 as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at January 1, 2018. Therefore, the comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under Topic 605. The Company applied the practical expedient related to assessment of contract modifications, whereby the Company is essentially allowed to use hindsight when assessing the effect of a modification and accounting for the modified contract as if it existed from the beginning of the original contract. 
Previously, the Company recognized revenue for professional services contracts either on a milestone method or completed contract basis. Under Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control transfers to a customer. As professional services can be highly customized for each customer, there is no alternative use for the services. When there is an enforceable right to payment for service completed combined with no alternative use of the services, the services meet criteria for over time revenue recognition. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided and as the customer benefits from the service. Revenue is recognized progressively based on the costs incurred method. When the professional services are not highly customized as in basic software installation services, customers do not take control of the services until they are completed. Therefore, the Company continues to recognize revenue for such contracts when the services are completed and customers formally accept them.
In certain circumstances, a contract with a customer that contains a software arrangement may include provisions for customer acceptance. In these cases, when or as the performance obligation is satisfied, the Company recognizes revenue and records a contract asset until customer acceptance is received. Once customer acceptance is received, the contract asset is reclassified to accounts receivable. As of September 30, 3018, contract assets related to these arrangements are minimal. In situations where the performance obligation has not been met and the Company has not received customer acceptance, no revenue is recognized.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
until customer acceptance is received. Once customer acceptance is received, the contract asset is reclassified to trade receivables, net. In these circumstances, the Company would consider ASC 606-10-55-86 and -87 and conclude that although a standard method to transferring the software and services is not met, the standard terms of the customer acceptance provisions and favorable history of customer acceptances support revenue recognition prior to customer acceptance. The Company also would only recognize revenue prior to customer acceptance only if there were no remaining inputs related to performance obligation. These instances are currently immaterial. For certain contracts that contain customer acceptance clauses, such as customized software arrangements, the revenue is recognized pursuant to ASC 606-25 25-27(c) since the Company’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
Impacts on financial statements
The impact to net sales and cost of sales would have been decreases of $5.2 and $6.5, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and $19.0 and $15.1, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The impact after tax was $0.9 and $(2.7) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, and was primarily a result of timing of deferred revenue related to products and software for certain amounts being recognized that would have previously been deferred, and certain amounts being deferred that would have previously been recognized.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
In May 2018, the Company announced its decision to reallocate future dividend funds towards debt reduction and other capital resource needs.
The Company’s share-based compensation payments to employees are recognized based on their grant-date fair values during the period in which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. Share-based compensation is primarily recognized as a component of selling and administrative expense. Total share-based compensation expense was $6.9 and $8.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and was $27.2 and $23.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
As of September 30, 2018, there were 0.1 non-employee director deferred shares vested and outstanding.
On April 25, 2018, the Company's shareholders approved amendments to the 2017 Plan, which provide for an additional 1.2 common shares available for award. The 2017 Plan is expected to attract and retain directors, officers and employees of the Company by providing incentives and rewards for performance.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
As a result of applying the correction of repairable service parts inventory retrospectively, a decrease in the inventory balance of $8.1 was reflected in the December 31, 2017 service parts balance previously reported.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
In May 2017, the Company announced a strategic partnership with Kony, a leading enterprise mobility and application company, to offer white label mobile application solutions for financial institutions and retailers. The Company acquired a minority equity stake in Kony, which is accounted for using the cost method of accounting. As of September 30, 2018, the Company's carrying value in Kony was $14.0 and the fair value was not estimated as there were no events or changes in circumstances in the investment. 
Securities and other investments also includes a cash surrender value of insurance contracts of $8.3 and $79.8 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The decrease is due to the monetization of the Company's investment in the company owned life insurance plans for cash needs across the organization. In addition, it includes an interest rate swap asset carrying value of $8.8 and $7.6 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which also represents fair value (refer to note 18).
The Company has finance lease receivables of $14.9 and $14.4 in other assets as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
There were no significant changes in provision for credit losses, recoveries and write-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. In both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company sold finance receivables of $4.5 in Brazil. As of September 30, 2018, finance leases and notes receivable individually evaluated for impairment were $30.5 and $10.8, respectively, with no provision recorded. As of September 30, 2017, finance leases and notes receivable individually evaluated for impairment were $32.4 and $21.0, respectively.
The Company records interest income and any fees or costs related to financing receivables using the effective interest method over the term of the lease or loan. The Company reviews the aging of its financing receivables to determine past due and delinquent 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
accounts. Credit quality is reviewed at inception and is re-evaluated as needed based on customer-specific circumstances. Receivable balances 60 days to 89 days past due are reviewed and may be placed on nonaccrual status based on customer-specific circumstances. Receivable balances are placed on nonaccrual status upon reaching greater than 89 days past due. Upon receipt of payment on nonaccrual financing receivables, interest income is recognized and accrual of interest is resumed once the account has been made current or the specific circumstances have been resolved.
As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the recorded investment in past due financing receivables on nonaccrual status was $0.4 and $0.6, respectively, and there were no recorded investments in finance receivables past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. The recorded investment in impaired notes receivable was $4.1 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and was fully reserved and as of September 30, 2018 are all greater than 89 days past due. 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Amortization expense on capitalized software of $8.8 and $8.6 was included in service and software cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Amortization expense on capitalized software of $25.6 and $27.9 was included in service and software cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's total amortization expense, including deferred financing costs, was $38.2 and $42.7 the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's total amortization expense, including deferred financing costs, was $114.8 and $121.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In 2018, the Company acquired the remaining portion of the noncontrolling interest in its China operations for $5.8 for which no goodwill was recorded. In 2017, the $5.6 acquired goodwill from Moxx Group B.V. (Moxx) and Visio Objekt GmbH (Visio) primarily relates to anticipated synergies achieved through increased scale and higher utilization of the service organization.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
During 2016, the Company launched a multi-year integration and transformation program, known as DN2020. The DN2020 plan focused on the utilization of cost efficiencies and synergy opportunities that result from the transformational acquisition of Wincor Nixdorf AG (Diebold Nixdorf AG), which aligned employee activities with the Company's goal of delivering cost reductions of approximately $240 by the year 2020. The Company incurred restructuring charges of $17.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, and $6.0 and $44.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to DN2020. As of June 30, 2018, the Company suspended this plan and does not anticipate additional DN2020 restructuring costs.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
At the beginning of the 2015, Diebold Nixdorf AG initiated the Delta Program related to restructuring and realignment. As part of a change process that has spanned several years, the Delta Program was designed to hasten the expansion of software and professional services operations and to further enhance profitability in the services business. This program included expansion in the high-end fields of managed services and outsourcing. It also involved capacity adjustments on the hardware side, enabling the Company to respond more effectively to market volatility while maintaining its abilities with innovation. There were no charges during the periods presented. As of the date of the acquisition of Diebold Nixdorf AG, the restructuring accrual balance acquired was $45.5 and consisted of severance activities. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment of $8.2 to the acquired restructuring accrual resulting in a final fair value of $37.3. As of September 30, 2018, the Company concluded this plan and no additional restructuring costs will be incurred.
Strategic Alliance Plan
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Short-term uncommitted lines mature in less than one year. The amount available under the short-term uncommitted lines at September 30, 2018 was $44.1.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
On August 30, 2018, the Company entered into a sixth amendment and incremental amendment (the Sixth Amendment) to its Credit Agreement. The Amendment amended the financial covenants and established a new senior secured incremental term A-1 facility in an aggregate principal amount of $650.0 (Term Loan A-1 Facility) and makes certain other changes to the Credit Agreement. 
A portion of the proceeds of the Term Loan A-1 Facility are restricted to fund the purchase of the remaining shares of Diebold Nixdorf AG not owned by the Company. The proceeds were used to make optional prepayments of existing term A loans in the amount of $130.0 and to permanently reduce revolving credit commitments in an amount of $20.0 and to make a purchase pursuant to an offer open to all term B lenders on a pro rata basis for $100.0 in face principal amount of term B loans.

The reduction was funded using the $250.0 proceeds drawn from the Delayed Draw Term Loan A Facility, a replacement of $70.0 with Term Loan B Facility - Euro and previous principal payments.
The debt facilities under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries that are borrowers or guarantors under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
interest related to the Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary shares the Company did not acquire of $386.7 and was reclassified to redeemable noncontrolling interest during the first quarter of 2017. For the period of time that the DPLTA is effective, the noncontrolling interest related to the Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary shares the Company did not acquire will remain in redeemable noncontrolling interest and presented outside of equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets of the Company. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the balance related to the redeemable noncontrolling interest related to the Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary shares the Company did not acquire was $136.4 and $454.6, respectively. The change is primarily related to the redemption of Diebold Nixdorf AG 4.8 ordinary shares in the three and nine months ended of 2018. The Company increased its ownership stake in Diebold Nixdorf AG to 27.7 ordinary shares, or approximately 93 percent, as of September 30, 2018, which has allowed the Company to initiate squeeze-out procedures to acquire the remaining outstanding shares.
The DPLTA offers the Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders, at their election, (i) the ability to put their Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary shares to Diebold KGaA in exchange for cash compensation of €55.02 per Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary share or (ii) to remain Diebold Nixdorf AG minority shareholders and receive a recurring compensation in cash of €2.82 per Diebold Nixdorf AG ordinary share for each full fiscal year of Diebold Nixdorf AG. The redemption value adjustment includes the updated cash compensation pursuant to the DPLTA. A portion of the proceeds of the Term Loan A-1 Facility are restricted to fund the purchase of the remaining shares of Diebold Nixdorf AG not owned by the Company. The Company classified the proceeds set aside to purchase the remaining shares in restricted cash in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

In the first quarter of 2018, the Company acquired the remaining portion of its noncontrolling interest in its China operations for $5.8 in the aggregate.
During 2017, the Company acquired all the capital stock of Moxx and certain assets and liabilities of Visio for $5.6 in the aggregate, net of cash acquired, which are included in the Retail and Eurasia Banking segments, respectively. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company acquired Moxx, which is a Netherlands based managed services company that provides managed mobility solutions for enterprises that use a large number of mobile assets in their business operations. In the second quarter of 2017, the Company acquired Visio, which is a design company based in Germany.
During 2017, the Company divested its legacy Diebold business in the United Kingdom (U.K.) to Cennox Group for $5.0, fulfilling the requirements previously set forth by the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The divestiture closed on June 30, 2017. As part of the Company's routine efforts to evaluate its business operations, during 2017, the Company divested its electronic security (ES) businesses located in Mexico and Chile in the second and third quarters of 2017, respectively. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.2 related to these transactions. The combined net sales of the divestitures represented less than one percent of total net sales of the Company for 2017.
The Company has qualified retirement plans covering certain U.S. employees that have been closed to new participants since 2003 and frozen since December 2013. Plans that cover salaried employees provide retirement benefits based on an employee’s compensation during the ten years before the date of the plan freeze or the date of the employee's actual separation from service, if earlier. The Company’s funding policy for salaried plans is to contribute annually based on actuarial projections and applicable regulations. Plans covering hourly employees generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service. The Company’s funding policy for hourly plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by applicable regulations.
The Company has non-qualified pension plans to provide supplemental retirement benefits to certain officers, which were also frozen since December 2013. Benefits are payable at retirement based upon a percentage of the participant’s compensation, as defined. In addition to providing retirement benefits, the Company provides post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits (referred to as other benefits) for certain retired employees. Retired eligible employees in the U.S. may be entitled to these benefits based upon years of service with the Company, age at retirement and collective bargaining agreements. There are no plan assets and the Company funds the benefits as the claims are paid. The post-retirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and life insurance plans together with relevant actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost trend rates.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
The Company also has defined benefit plans in Germany and Switzerland, among others. In Germany, post-employment benefit plans are set up as employer funded pension plans and deferred compensation plans. The employer funded pension commitments in Germany are based upon direct performance-related commitments in terms of defined contribution plans. Each beneficiary receives, depending on individual pay-scale grouping, contractual classification or income level, different yearly contributions. The contribution is multiplied by an age factor appropriate to the respective pension plan and credited to the individual retirement account of the employee. The retirement accounts may be used up at retirement by either a one-time lump-sum payout or payments of up to ten years. Insured events include disability, death and reaching of retirement age. In Switzerland, the post-employment benefit plan is required due to statutory provisions. The employees receive their pension payments as a function of contributions paid, a fixed interest rate and annuity factors. Insured events are disability, death and reaching of retirement age. 
Contributions
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
As a result of the adoption of ASU 2017-12, $(0.4) and $2.4 was included in net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively and $(0.7) and $(0.6) in cost of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, which would have been included in foreign exchange gain (loss), net in the prior period. 
Foreign Exchange
Net Investment Hedges The Company has international subsidiaries with net balance sheet positions that generate cumulative translation adjustments within AOCI. The Company uses derivatives to manage potential changes in value of its net investments. The Company uses the forward-to-forward method for its quarterly measurement of ineffectiveness assessments of hedge effectiveness. No ineffectiveness results if the notional amount of the derivative matches the portion of the net investment designated as being hedged because the Company uses derivative instruments with underlying exchange rates consistent with its functional currency and the functional currency of the hedged net investment. Changes in value that are deemed effective are accumulated in AOCI where they will remain until they are reclassified to income together with the gain or loss on the entire investment upon substantial liquidation of the subsidiary. The fair value of the Company’s net investment hedge contracts was $2.4 and $2.0 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The net loss recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge derivative instruments was $2.7 and $2.7 in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The net loss recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge derivative instruments was $13.6 and $4.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
On August 15, 2016, the Company designated its €350.0 euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility as a net investment hedge of its investments in certain subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency in order to reduce volatility in stockholders' equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the euro with respect to the U.S. dollar. Effectiveness is assessed at least quarterly by confirming that the respective designated net investments' net equity balances at the beginning of any period collectively continues to equal or exceed the balance outstanding on the Company's euro-denominated term loan. Changes in value that are deemed effective are accumulated in AOCI. When the respective net investments are sold or substantially liquidated, the balance of the cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI will be reclassified into earnings. The net gain (loss) recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge foreign currency borrowings was $0.5 and $(12.0) for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The net gain (loss) recognized in AOCI on net investment hedge foreign currency borrowings was $4.9 and $(37.8) for the nine months September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. On March 30, 2017, the Company de-designated €130.6 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility and on May 9, 2017, the Company designated an additional €66.8 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility as a result of its repricing described under note 11. On September 21, 2017, the Company de-designated €101.1 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility. On June 21, 2018, the Company re-designated €30.2 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility. On July 23, 2018, the Company de-designated €180.2 of its euro-denominated Term Loan B Facility. 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Cash Flow Hedges The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The Company has multiple pay-fixed receive-variable interest rate swaps outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $400.0.
Amounts reported in AOCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. The Company estimates that a minimal amount will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense over the next year.
The Company has an interest rate swap for a nominal sum of €50.0, which was entered into in May 2010 with a ten-year term from October 1, 2010 until September 30, 2020. This interest rate swap mitigated the interest rate risk associated with the European Investment Bank debt, which was paid in full during 2017. For this interest rate swap, the three-month EURIBOR is received and a fixed interest of 2.97 percent is paid. The fair value, which is measured at market prices, as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $(5.4) and $(5.5), respectively. The interest rate contract is not designated and changes in the fair value of non-designated interest rate swap agreements are recognized in miscellaneous, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized $0.5 and $1.5 in interest expense relating to the interest rate swap for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value
The Company uses the end of period when determining the timing of transfers between levels. During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, there were no transfers between levels. 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
At September 30, 2018, the Company had purchase commitments due within one year totaling $0.9 for materials and services through contract manufacturing agreements at negotiated prices. The Company guarantees a fixed cost of certain products used in production to its China strategic partners.
The Company has challenged the customs rulings in Thailand seeking to retroactively collect customs duties on previous imports of ATMs. Management believes that the customs authority’s attempt to retroactively assess customs duties is in contravention of World Trade Organization agreements and, accordingly, challenged the rulings. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company received a prospective ruling from the U.S. Customs Border Protection which is consistent with the Company's interpretation of the treaty in question. In August 2017, the Supreme Court of Thailand ruled in the Company's favor, finding that Customs' attempt to collect duties for importation of ATMs is improper. In addition, in August 2016 and February 2017, the tax court of appeals rendered decisions in favor of the Company related to more than half of the assessments at issue. The surviving matters remain at various stages of the appeals process and the Company will use the Supreme Court's decision in support of its position in those matters. Management remains confident that the Company has a valid legal position in these appeals. Accordingly, the Company does not have any amount accrued for this contingency.
