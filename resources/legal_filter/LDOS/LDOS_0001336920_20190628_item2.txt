Effective the beginning of fiscal 2019, we changed the composition of our Defense Solutions reportable segment to better align the operations within the reportable segment to the customers we serve. This resulted in the identification of new operating segments within Defense Solutions. In addition, certain contracts were reassigned between the Civil and Defense Solutions reportable segments. While this activity did not have a material impact on the Company's reportable segments, prior year segments results have been recast to reflect this change. 
Business Environment and Trends 
During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, we generated approximately 87% of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. government. Accordingly, our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. government spending, especially on national security, homeland security and intelligence, and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the U.S. government.
In September 2018, Congress passed and the President signed a consolidated appropriations bill funding the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Health and Human Services for the full government fiscal year ("GFY") 2019. Earlier in 2018, funding for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Energy as well as funding for Congress were also enacted. All were funded at increased levels from the previous year. 
In March 2019, the President submitted the GFY 2020 budget proposal to Congress. The budget includes $750 billion for defense and $563 billion for non-defense spending. The defense budget proposal includes $576 billion for national defense and $165 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations fund.
On July 22, 2019, the White House and Congress reached a tentative two-year budget deal to raise spending caps and suspend the debt ceiling until July 2021. Under the deal, allocations for national defense spending increases to $738 billion in GFY 2020 and to $741 billion in GFY 2021. For non-defense programs, spending increases to $632 billion in GFY 2020 and $635 billion in GFY 2021. Overall, the measure increases spending by $323 billion over the limits set under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Congress is now addressing the passage of the appropriations bills for GFY 2020.
International Markets
The increase in revenues in constant currency(1) for the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, was 8.4% and 7.2%, as compared to an actual increase in revenues of 7.9% and 6.7%, respectively. The foreign currency impact was mainly attributable to adverse exchange rate movements in the British pound and Australian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar. 
Segment and Corporate Results
The increase in revenues for the six months ended June 28, 2019, as compared to the six months ended June 29, 2018, was primarily attributable to new awards and a net increase in program volumes, partially offset by the completion of certain contracts, lower net profit write-ups in the current year and adverse exchange rate movements in the Australian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar.
The increase in operating income for the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, as compared to the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, was primarily due to new awards, partially offset by lower net profit write-ups in the current year.

Non-Operating (Expense) Income, net
Non-operating expense, net of $31 million for the three months ended June 28, 2019 was consistent with the non-operating expense, net of $34 million for the three months ended June 29, 2018.
Non-operating income, net for the six months ended June 28, 2019 was $23 million as compared to non-operating expense, net of $68 million for the six months ended June 29, 2018. The $91 million increase was primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business.
For the three months ended June 28, 2019, our effective tax rate was 22.9% compared to 12.1% for the three months ended June 29, 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits recognized during the three months ended June 29, 2018, related to the anticipated sale of our commercial cybersecurity business.
We recorded net bookings worth an estimated $3.0 billion and $6.2 billion during the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, respectively, as compared to $3.4 billion and $5.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, respectively.
The decrease in backlog within the Civil segment was primarily due to $154 million related to the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business in the first quarter of 2019.
At June 28, 2019, and December 28, 2018, we had outstanding debt of $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. We made principal payments on our long-term debt of $17 million and $48 million during the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, respectively, and $27 million and $44 million during the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, respectively. This activity included required quarterly principal payments on our senior secured term loans of $14 million and $41 million during the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, respectively, and $16 million and $31 million during the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, respectively. In April 2018, we made a required debt prepayment of $10 million on our senior secured term loans. The prepayment was a result of the annual excess cash flow calculation clause in our credit agreements. The notes outstanding as of June 28, 2019, contain financial covenants and customary restrictive covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants as of June 28, 2019. 
We paid dividends of $47 million and $101 million during the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, respectively, and $51 million and $103 million during the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, respectively.
For the next 12 months, we anticipate that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs, including servicing our debt, through cash generated from operations, available cash balances and, if needed, borrowings from our revolving credit facility. 
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $85 million for the three months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to less favorable timing of working capital changes and higher tax payments.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $181 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher advance payments from customers, $24 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition and lower payments for integration and restructuring costs, partially offset by higher payments for taxes and timing of interest payments.
Net cash provided by investing activities increased $330 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year, primarily due to proceeds of $267 million received for the disposition of our commercial cybersecurity business and sale of real estate properties and $81 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition, partially offset by higher purchases of equipment and software. 
Net cash used in financing activities decreased $128 million for the three months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to $90 million of stock repurchases in the prior year quarter and $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year quarter.
Net cash used in financing activities increased $78 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $111 million increase in stock repurchases, partially offset by $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year.
