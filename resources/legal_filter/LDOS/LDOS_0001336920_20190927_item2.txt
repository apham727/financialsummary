Overview
Effective the beginning of fiscal 2019, we changed the composition of our Defense Solutions reportable segment to better align the operations within the reportable segment to the customers we serve. This resulted in the identification of new operating segments within Defense Solutions. In addition, certain contracts were reassigned between the Civil and Defense Solutions reportable segments. While this activity did not have a material impact on our reportable segments, prior year segment results have been recast to reflect this change. 
Business Environment and Trends 
In September 2018, Congress passed and the President signed a consolidated appropriations bill funding the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Health and Human Services for the full government fiscal year ("GFY") 2019. Earlier in 2018, funding for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Energy as well as funding for Congress were also enacted. All were funded at increased levels from the previous year. 
In March 2019, the President submitted the GFY 2020 budget proposal to Congress. The budget included $750 billion for defense and $563 billion for non-defense spending. The defense budget proposal included $576 billion for national defense and $165 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations fund.
On July 22, 2019, the White House and Congress reached a tentative two-year budget deal to raise spending caps and suspend the debt ceiling until July 2021. Allocations for national defense spending increased to $738 billion in GFY 2020 and to $741 billion in GFY 2021. For non-defense programs, spending increased to $632 billion in GFY 2020 and $635 billion in GFY 2021. Overall, the measure increased spending by $323 billion over the limits set under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. 
Congress is currently addressing the passage of appropriations bills for GFY 2020. A CR was enacted on September 27, 2019, providing funding at GFY 2019 enacted levels until November 21, 2019.
The increase in revenues in constant currency(1) for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019, was 10.6% and 8.4%, as compared to an actual increase in revenues of 10.1% and 7.9%, respectively. The foreign currency impact was mainly attributable to adverse exchange rate movements in the British pound and Australian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar.

Non-operating expense, net for the nine months ended September 27, 2019 was $12 million as compared to $101 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2018. The $89 million decrease was primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business.
For the three months ended September 27, 2019, our effective tax rate was 24.3% compared to 13.5% for the three months ended September 28, 2018.

We recorded net bookings worth an estimated $5.2 billion and $11.5 billion during the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019, respectively, as compared to $4.6 billion and $10.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2018, respectively.
