 Total other income decreased by $7,200 (52.9%) to $6,400 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 from $13,600 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 due to a gain on a sale of investment securities last year.

Net cash used in investing activities was $88,600 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $38,600 used during the nine months ended March 31, 2017 principally due to new capital equipment purchased during the current year period by the Benchtop Laboratory Equipment Operations. The Company used $107,700 in financing activities in the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $199,900 in the nine months ended March 31, 2017, principally because the Company paid a dividend last year, and paid more in contingent consideration in last year’s same period.
