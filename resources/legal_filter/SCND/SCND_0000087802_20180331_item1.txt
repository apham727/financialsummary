  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842). The FASB issued this update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the new standard. 
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”. This update provides guidance on how to record eight specific cash flow issues. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and a retrospective transition method to each period should be presented. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this update on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)”, requiring that the statement of cash flows explain the change in the total cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied using a retrospective approach which requires application of the guidance for all periods presented. The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
  Accounts receivable of $245,400 was reclassified from current to long-term assets on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2017 to conform to the current period's presentation. 
 Approximately 53% and 54% of net benchtop laboratory equipment sales (39% and 40% of total revenues) for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were derived from the Company’s main product, the Vortex-Genie 2 mixer, excluding accessories. 
 Approximately 21% of total benchtop laboratory equipment sales (16% of total revenues) were derived from the Torbal Scales Division for both the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

  3. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 The FASB defines the fair value of financial instruments as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. 
 Level 1 - Inputs that are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 
 Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
 The fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are based on a probability weighted approach derived from the estimates of earn-out criteria and the probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving those criteria. The measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, therefore, the Company classifies this liability as Level 3 in the following tables. 
  5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
 Total amortization expense was $61,200 and $69,900 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively and $183,400 and $224,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets is $60,200 for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, $185,800 for fiscal 2019, $65,400 for fiscal 2020, $48,000 for fiscal 2021, $27,000 for fiscal 2022, and $12,800 thereafter.
