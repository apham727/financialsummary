NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



March 31, 2019 



UNAUDITED



1.Description of the Business



ManTech International Corporation (depending on the circumstances, “ManTech” “Company” “we” “our” “ours” or “us”) provide mission-focused technology solutions and services for U.S. defense, intelligence community and federal civilian agencies.
In business more than 50 years, we excel in full-spectrum cyber, data collection & analytics, enterprise information technology (IT), systems and software engineering solutions that support national and homeland security.
2.Basis of Presentation



The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations.
3.Revenue from Contracts with Customers



On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not substantially complete as of January 1, 2018.
ASC 606 outlines a five-step model whereby revenue is recognized as performance obligations within the contract are satisfied.
ASC 606 also requires new, expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition.
Substantially all of our revenue is derived from services and solutions provided to the U.S. government or to prime contractors supporting the U.S. government, including services by our employees and our subcontractors, and solutions that include third-party hardware and software that we purchase and integrate as a part of our overall solutions.
We provide our services and solutions under three types of contracts: cost-reimbursable, fixed-price and time-and-materials.
Fixed-price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance over a defined period.
We typically recognize revenue for time and material contracts under the "right to invoice" model.
For contracts that do not meet the criteria to measure performance as a right to invoice, or under the series guidance, we utilize an Estimate at Completion process to measure progress toward completion.
We typically estimate progress towards completion based on cost incurred or direct labor incurred.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the aggregate impact of adjustments in contract estimates increased our revenue by $3.2 million.

We have one reportable segment.
Offices or divisions within an agency or department of the U.S. government may directly, or through a prime contractor, use our services as a separate customer as long as the customer has independent decision-making and contracting authority within its organization.
The following tables disclose revenue (in thousands) by contract type, customer, prime or subcontractor and geography for the periods presented.
We have one contract which accounts for 11.4% of our accounts receivable balance.
The allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate for exposure to compliance, contractual issues and bad debts related to prime contractors.
The following table discloses contract liabilities (in thousands):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the amount of revenue that was included in the opening contract liabilities balance was $18.0 million.
The remaining performance obligation as of March 31, 2019 is $2.7 billion.
The following table discloses when we expect to recognize the remaining performance obligation as revenue (in billions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



4.Leases



The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASC 842, Leases, to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of right of use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet.
Most prominent among the changes in ASC 842 is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases.
Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
We are also required to recognize and measure leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented using a modified retrospective approach, with certain practical expedients available.
We elected to adopt ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, resulting in us recording operating lease liabilities of $129.6 million and operating lease right of use assets of $118.7 million.
We elected the practical expedient to recognize the lease payments related to short-term leases as profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease payments in the period in which the obligation for those payment is incurred.
We also elected the following transition related practical expedients: not to reassess whether expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, not to reassess lease classification as determined under ASC 840 and not to reassess initial direct costs from any existing lease.
We also elected the practical expedient as an accounting election not to separate nonlease components from lease components on all classes of underlying assets.
Our leases include nonlease components such as common area maintenance (CAM), utilities and operating expenses.
We also implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information upon adoption.
The most significant impact was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases, while our accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged.
We determine if a contract is or contains a lease at inception.
In making this determination, we consider all relevant facts and circumstances.
We reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease only if the terms and conditions of the contract are changed.
We account for lease components and nonlease components associated with a lease as a single lease component.
Operating leases are included in Operating lease ROU assets, Operating lease liabilities—current and Operating lease liabilities—long term on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Our ROU asset is recognized as the lease liability, any initial indirect costs and any prepaid lease payments, less any lease incentives.
Our lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date.
Our variable lease payments are excluded in measuring ROU asset and lease liability because they do not depend on an index or a rate or are not in substance fixed payments.
We exclude lease incentives and initial direct cost incurred from our lease payments.
For operating leases, after lease commencement, we measure our lease liability for each period at the present value of any remaining lease payments, discounted by using the rate determined at lease commencement.
In our condensed consolidated statement of income, we recognize a single operating lease expense calculated on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term.
The amortization of the ROU asset increases each year as a result of the declining lease liability balance.
Variable lease payments are not recognized in the measurement of the lease liability - they are recognized in the period in which the related obligation has been incurred.
For finance leases, after lease commencement, we measure our lease liability by using the effective interest rate method.
In each period, the lease liability will be increased to reflect the interest that is accrued on the related lease liability by using the appropriate discount rate, offset by a decrease in the lease liability resulting from the periodic lease payments.
We recognize the ROU asset at cost, reduced by any accumulated depreciation.
The ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis.
Together, the interest expense and amortization expense result in a front-loaded expense profile.
We have operating and finance leases for real estate, transportation vehicles and equipment.
Our variable lease payments do not depend on an index or a rate or are not in substance fixed payments.
Our leases have remaining lease terms of 0.1 years to 11 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 14 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.
Our transportation vehicles and equipment leases include a residual value guarantee, which is a guarantee made to the lessor that the value of the underlying asset returned to the lessor at the end of the lease will be at least a specific amount.
We sublease some of our real estate lease space, resulting in sublease income of $23 thousand as of the three months ended March 31, 2019.
We do not have any leases that have not yet commenced due to construction or design of the underlying asset.
We recognize payments related to short-term leases (less than one year) as profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable leases payments in the period in which the obligation for those payment is incurred.
As such, our short-term lease expense as of March 31, 2019 under ASC 842 was $1.4 million.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, we incurred variable lease costs of $0.5 million.
Under that method, basic and diluted earnings per share data are presented for each class of common stock.
In applying the two-class method, we determined that undistributed earnings should be allocated equally on a per share basis between Class A and Class B common stock.
Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.
Shares issued during the period and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period in which the shares were outstanding.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, there were 51,089 shares and 203,854 shares, respectively, issued from the exercise of stock options.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 there were 72,188 shares and 86,233 shares issued from the vesting of restricted stock units.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



8.Debt



Revolving Credit Facility—We maintain a credit facility with a syndicate of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A, as sole administrative agent.
The credit agreement provides for a $500 million revolving credit facility, with a $75 million letter of credit sublimit and a $30 million swing line loan sublimit.
The credit agreement also includes an accordion feature that permits us to arrange with the lenders for the provision of additional commitments.
The maturity date is August 17, 2022.
Borrowings under our credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and those of our Material Subsidiaries (as defined in the credit agreement) and bear interest at one of the following variable rates as selected by us at the time of borrowing: a London Interbank Offer Rate based rate plus market-rate spreads (1.25% to 2.25% based on our consolidated total leverage ratio) or Bank of America's base rate plus market spreads (0.25% to 1.25% based on our consolidated total leverage ratio).
The terms of the credit agreement permit prepayment and termination of the loan commitments at any time, subject to certain conditions.
The credit agreement requires us to comply with specified financial covenants, including the maintenance of certain leverage ratios and a certain consolidated coverage ratio.
As of and during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement.
14



There was $96.0 million and $7.5 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
The maximum available borrowing under the revolving credit facility at March 31, 2019 was $396.3 million.
9.Commitments and Contingencies



Contracts with the U.S. government, including subcontracts, are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements and, from time-to-time, agencies of the U.S. government, in the ordinary course of business, investigate whether our operations are conducted in accordance with these requirements and the terms of the relevant contracts.
Management believes it has adequately reserved for any losses that may be experienced from any investigation of which it is aware.
An officer of our Company is a party to a pending arbitration proceeding with a former employer that relates to certain breach of contract claims.
Pursuant to applicable accounting standards, we have determined that it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome could cause us to incur a liability/loss under these indemnification arrangements.
As such, we have not disclosed an amount of potential loss as of March 31, 2019.
We have $7.7 million outstanding on our letter of credit, of which $14 thousand is related to an outstanding performance bond in connection with a contract between ManTech MENA, LLC and Jadwalean International Operations and Management Company to fulfill technical support requirements for the Royal Saudi Air Force.
10.Stock-Based Compensation



Our 2016 Management Incentive Plan (the Plan) was designed to attract, retain and motivate key employees.
The types of awards available under the Plan include, among others, stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units (RSUs).
Equity awards granted under the Plan are settled in shares of Class A common stock.
At the beginning of each year, the Plan provides that the number of shares available for issuance automatically increases by an amount equal to 1.5% of the total number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding on December 31st of the previous year.
Through March 31, 2019, the Board of Directors has authorized the issuance of up to 15,148,321 shares under this Plan.
Through March 31, 2019, the remaining aggregate number of shares of our common stock available for future grants under the Plan was 6,685,056.
The Plan expires in March 2026.
The Plan is administered by the compensation committee of our Board of Directors, along with its delegates.
Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the committee has the Board of Directors’ authority to administer and interpret the Plan, including the discretion to determine the exercise price, vesting schedule, contractual life and the number of shares to be issued.
Stock Compensation Expense—For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded $1.3 million and $1.1 million of stock-based compensation expense.
No compensation expense of employees with stock awards, including stock-based compensation expense, was capitalized during the periods.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded $0.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively, to income tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options, vested cancellations and the vesting of restricted stock.
We typically issue options that vest over three years in equal installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant.
Under the terms of the Plan, the 



 15



contractual life of the option grants may not exceed eight years.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, we issued options that expire five years from the date of grant.
Fair Value Determination—We have used the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of our awards on the date of grant.
We will reconsider the use of the Black-Scholes-Merton model if additional information becomes available in the future that indicates another model would be more appropriate or if grants issued in future periods have characteristics that cannot be reasonably estimated under this model.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



•Risk-free interest rate—The yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury strips was used to extrapolate a forward-yield curve.
This “term structure” of future interest rates was then input into a numeric model to provide the equivalent risk-free rate to be used in the Black-Scholes-Merton model based on the expected term of the underlying grants.
Option grants that vested during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 had a combined fair value of $1.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested awards was $7.3 million as of March 31, 2019, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2 years.
Restricted Stock—Under the Plan, we have issued restricted stock.
A restricted stock award is an issuance of shares that cannot be sold or transferred by the recipient until the vesting period lapses.
Restricted stock issued to members of our Board of Directors vest on the one year anniversary of the grant date.
The related compensation expense is recognized over the service period and is based on the grant date fair value of the stock.
The grant date fair value of the restricted stock is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.
Restricted Stock Activity— There was no restricted stock activity during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity during the year ended December 31, 2018.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



RSUs—Under the Plan, we have issued RSUs.
RSUs are not actual shares, but rather a right to receive shares in the future.
The shares are not issued and the employee cannot sell or transfer shares prior to vesting and have no voting rights until the RSUs vest.
Employees who are granted RSUs do not receive dividend payments during the vesting period.
Performance-based RSUs result in the delivery of shares only if (a) performance criteria is met and (b) the employee remains employed, in good standing, through the date of the performance period.
17



Time-based RSUs vest in one-third increments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant.
The grant date fair value of the RSUs is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of dividends expected to be awarded during the service period.
We recognize the grant date fair value of RSUs of shares we expect to issue as compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period.
RSU Activity—For performance-based RSUs that vested in 2019 and 2018, each RSU awarded resulted in the issuance of 1.5 shares, which were issued net of applicable payroll tax withholdings.
