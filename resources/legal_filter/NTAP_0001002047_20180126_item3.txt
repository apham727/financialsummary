Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We use certain derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risks.
All financial instruments are used in accordance with management-approved policies.
Interest Rate Risk  



Fixed Income Investments — As of January 26, 2018, we had fixed income debt investments of $3.1 billion.
Our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase, which are classified as available-for-sale investments.
These investments, which consist primarily of corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury and government debt securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit, are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase.
A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates from levels as of January 26, 2018 would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-income securities of approximately $53 million.
We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.
We monitor and evaluate our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for any other-than-temporary impairments.
Debt — As of January 26, 2018, we have outstanding $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes.
We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Since these instruments bear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates.
However, the fair value of these instruments fluctuates when interest rates change.
See Note 9 – Financing Arrangements of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
Credit Facility — We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates in connection with our $1.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility.
Borrowings under the facility accrue interest at rates that vary based on certain market rates and our credit rating on our Senior Notes.
Consequently, our interest expense would fluctuate with any changes in these market interest rates or in our credit rating if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility.
As of January 26, 2018, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  



We hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings.
We also use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures related to forecasted sales transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies.
These derivatives are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging.
In entering into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts.
We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign currency exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks.
All contracts have a maturity of less than six months.
See Note 11 – Derivatives and Hedging Activities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our derivatives and hedging activities.
