Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Cloud Services
Assuming a stable or improving economic environment, and, subject to our risk factors, we expect the revenue and profits in our Digital Media business to improve over the next several quarters as we integrate our recent acquisitions and over the longer term as advertising transactions continue to shift from offline to online. The main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to visitors to our websites and those included within our advertising networks, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and those included within our advertising networks.
The operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our websites is significantly higher than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from those placed on third-party websites. Growth in advertising revenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from third-party websites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future. However, the trend in advertising spend is shifting to mobile devices and other newer advertising formats which generally experience lower margins than those from desktop computers and tablets. We expect this trend to continue to put pressure on our margins.
Revenues
Our revenues consist of revenues from our Cloud Services business and from our Digital Media business. Cloud Services revenues primarily consist of revenues from “fixed” customer subscription revenues and “variable” revenues generated from actual usage of our services. We also generate Cloud Services revenues from IP licensing. Digital Media revenues primarily consist of advertising revenues, subscriptions earned through the granting of access to, or delivery of, certain data products or services to customers, fees paid for generating business leads, and licensing and sale of editorial content and trademarks.
Our revenues in 2019 have increased over the comparable three month period of 2018 primarily due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth within both the Digital Media and Cloud Services businesses.

Non-Operating Income and Expenses
Interest expense, net.

Interest expense, net was $16.0 million and $15.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interest expense, net increased over the prior comparable period primarily due to lower interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments.

Other expense, net was $2.2 million and $4.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Other expense, net decreased over the prior comparable period due to decreased losses on equity securities, partially offset by increased losses on currency exchange.
Provision for income taxes amounted to $(0.3) million and $7.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our effective tax rate was (0.9)% and 27.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Equity Method Investment
Net loss in earnings of equity method investment. Net loss in earnings of equity method investment is generated from our investment in the OCV Fund for which we receive annual audited financial statements. The investment in the OCV Fund is presented net of tax and on a one-quarter lag due to the timing and availability of financial information from OCV. If the Company becomes aware of a significant decline in value, the loss will be recorded in the period in which the Company identifies the decline.
The net loss in earnings of equity method investment was $0.5 million and zero, net of tax benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized management fees of $0.8 million and zero, net of tax benefit, respectively.

Digital Media’s gross profit of $129.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased $15.1 million, or 13.3%, from the prior comparable period primarily due to business acquisitions.
Digital Media’s operating expenses of $130.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased $12.7 million from the prior comparable period primarily due to (a) additional amortization of intangible assets; (b) increased depreciation expense; (c) additional expense associated with businesses acquired in and subsequent to the prior comparable period comprised primarily of salary and related costs; and (d) an allocation of certain shared Corporate operating costs. 
As a result of these factors, Digital Media’s operating (loss) income of $(1.0) million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 decreased $2.4 million, or 70.4%, from the prior comparable period.
At March 31, 2019, we had cash and investments of $320.3 million compared to $293.3 million at December 31, 2018. The increase in cash and investments resulted primarily from cash provided by operating activities; partially offset by business acquisitions, dividends paid, purchases of property and equipment. At March 31, 2019, cash and investments consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $226.6 million and long-term investments of $93.7 million. Our investments consist of equity and debt securities. For financial statement presentation, we classify our debt securities primarily as short- and long-term based upon their maturity dates. Short-term investments mature within one year of the date of the financial statements and long-term investments mature one year or more from the date of the financial statements. We retain a substantial portion of our cash and investments in foreign jurisdictions for future reinvestment. As of March 31, 2019, cash and investments held within domestic and foreign jurisdictions were $252.0 million and $68.3 million, respectively. 
On February 6, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.4450 per share of j2 Global common stock payable on March 12, 2019 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 25, 2019. On May 2, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.4550 per share of j2 Global common stock payable on June 4, 2019 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 20, 2019. Future dividends are subject to Board approval. However, based on the significant number of current investment opportunities within the Company’s portfolio of businesses and the historic returns from prior investments, the Board of Directors has decided to suspend dividend payments for the foreseeable future after the June 4, 2019 payment.
During the first quarter 2019, the Company received capital call notices from the management of OCV Management, LLC. for $9.8 million, inclusive of certain management fees, of which $9.8 million has been paid for the three months ended March 31, 2019. 
We currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditure, stock repurchases and cash dividends for at least the next 12 months.
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations, together with cash and cash equivalents. Net cash provided by operating activities was $116.9 million and $103.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our operating cash flows resulted primarily from cash received from our customers offset by cash payments we made to third parties for their services, employee compensation and interest payments associated with our debt. The increase in our net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and increased depreciation and amortization; partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, lower uncertain tax positions and reduced deferred revenue. Our cash and cash equivalents were $226.6 million and $209.5 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
Net cash used in investing activities was $81.7 million and $107.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to business acquisitions, capital expenditures associated with the purchase of property and equipment and the purchase of investments.. The decrease in our net cash used in investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to reduced business acquisitions.
Net cash used in financing activities was $19.3 million and $20.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to dividends paid, repurchases of stock and business acquisitions; partially offset by proceeds associated with the exercise of stock options. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to dividends paid, repurchases of stock and business acquisitions. The change in net cash used in financing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to the proceeds from the exercise of stock options; partially offset by the payment of dividends and business acquisitions.
