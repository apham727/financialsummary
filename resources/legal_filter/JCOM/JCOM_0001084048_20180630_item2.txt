Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2018
Cloud Services Segment
Assuming a stable or improving economic environment, and subject to our risk factors, we expect the revenue and profits in our Digital Media segment to improve over the next several quarters as we integrate our recent acquisitions and over the longer term as advertising transactions continue to shift from offline to online. The main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to visitors to our websites and those included within our advertising networks, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and those included within our advertising networks.
The operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our websites is significantly higher than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from those placed on third-party websites. Growth in advertising revenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from third-party websites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future. However, the trend in advertising spend is shifting to mobile devices and other newer advertising formats which generally experience lower margins than those from desktop computers and tablets. We expect this trend to continue to put pressure on our margins.
Revenues
Our revenues consist of revenues from our Cloud Services segment and from our Digital Media segment. Cloud Services revenues primarily consist of revenues from “fixed” customer subscription revenues and “variable” revenues generated from actual usage of our services. We also generate Cloud Services revenues from IP licensing. Digital Media revenues is primarily derived from advertising revenues and subscription to services and information revenues consisting of fees paid for generating business leads, and licensing and sale of editorial content and trademarks.
Our revenues in 2018 have increased over the comparable three and six month periods of 2017 primarily due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth within both the Digital Media and Cloud Services segments.
Cost of Revenues
Operating Expenses
Sales and Marketing.
2018 was $74.7 million (primarily consists of $48.9 million of third-party advertising costs and $20.3 million of personnel costs) compared to 2017 of $66.0 million (primarily consists of $43.7 million of third-party advertising costs and $20.1 million of personnel costs). The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 versus the prior comparable periods was primarily due to increased personnel costs and advertising associated with the acquisition of businesses acquired in and subsequent to the second quarter 2017 within the Digital Media segment.
Research, Development and Engineering.
General and Administrative.
Our general and administrative costs consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, depreciation and amortization, changes in the fair value associated with contingent consideration, share-based compensation expense, bad debt expense, professional fees, severance and insurance costs. The increase in general and administrative expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 versus the prior comparable periods was primarily due to additional amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of fixed assets, personnel costs relating to businesses acquired in and subsequent to the second quarter 2017, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, severance costs associated with acquisitions and professional fees.
Share-Based Compensation
Non-Operating Income and Expenses
Interest expense, net. Our interest expense, net is generated primarily from interest expense due to outstanding debt, partially offset by interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest expense, net was $15.5 million and $13.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $31.3 million and $26.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest expense, net increased over the prior comparable periods primarily due to increased interest expense associated with the issuance of the $650 million 6.0% Senior Notes; partially offset by increased interest income on cash, cash equivalents and investments.
Other expense, net. Our other expense, net is generated primarily from miscellaneous items, gain or losses on currency exchange and gains or losses on investments. Other expense, net was $0.4 million and $4.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease over the prior comparable period is due to decreased losses on currency exchange. Other expense, net was $4.9 million and $4.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase is primarily due to a loss on equity investments of $3.7 million; partially offset by decreased losses on currency exchange over the prior comparable period.
Provision for income taxes amounted to $7.0 million and $9.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $14.1 million and $18.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Equity Method Investment

Net loss in earnings of equity method investment was $3.0 million, net of tax benefit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and is primarily attributable to our pro-rata portion of the annual management fees. 
Segment Results
We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on segment revenues, including both external and intersegment net sales, and segment operating income. We account for intersegment sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the segments. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segment’s operations. Corporate assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes and certain other assets. All significant intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at our consolidated financial results.

At June 30, 2018, we had cash and investments of $428.0 million compared to $408.7 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in cash and investments resulted primarily from cash from operations, partially offset by business acquisitions, dividends and interest paid, and purchases of property and equipment.

We retain a substantial portion of our cash and investments in foreign jurisdictions for future reinvestment.

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations, together with cash and cash equivalents. Net cash provided by operating activities was $206.3 million and $111.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our operating cash flows resulted primarily from cash received from our customers offset by cash payments we made to third parties for their services, employee compensation and interest payments associated with our debt.
