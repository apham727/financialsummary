Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
◦Sustain growth or profitability, particularly in light of an uncertain U.S. or worldwide economy and the related impact on customer acquisition and retention rates, customer usage levels, and credit and debit card payment declines;
Our Cloud Services segment generates revenues primarily from customer subscription and usage fees and from IP licensing fees. Our Digital Media segment generates revenues from advertising and sponsorships, subscription and usage fees, performance marketing and licensing fees.
In addition to growing our business organically, on a regular basis we acquire businesses to grow our customer bases, expand and diversify our service offerings, enhance our technologies, acquire skilled personnel and enter into new markets. 
Assuming a stable or improving economic environment, and subject to our risk factors, we expect the revenue and profits in our Digital Media segment to improve over the next several quarters as we integrate our recent acquisitions and over the longer term as advertising transactions continue to shift from offline to online. The main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to visitors to our websites and those included within our advertising networks, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and those included within our advertising networks.
The operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our websites is significantly higher than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from those placed on third-party websites. Growth in advertising revenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from third-party websites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future. However, the trend in advertising spend is shifting to mobile devices and other newer advertising formats which generally experience lower margins than those from desktop computers and tablets. We expect this trend to continue to put pressure on our margins.
We anticipate that the stable revenue trend in our Cloud Services segment combined with the improving revenue and profits in our Digital Media segment will result in overall improved revenue and profits for j2 Global on a consolidated basis, excluding the impact of any future acquisitions which can vary dramatically from period to period. 
We expect operating profit as a percentage of revenues to generally decrease in the future primarily due to the fact that revenue with respect to our Digital Media segment (i) is increasing as a percentage of our revenue on a consolidated basis and (ii) has historically operated at a lower operating margin.
Our revenues consist of revenues from our Cloud Services segment and from our Digital Media segment. Cloud Services revenues primarily consist of revenues from “fixed” customer subscription revenues and “variable” revenues generated from actual usage of our services. We also generate Cloud Services revenues from IP licensing. Digital Media revenues is primarily derived from advertising revenues and subscription to services and information revenues consisting of fees paid for generating business leads, and licensing and sale of editorial content and trademarks.
Our revenues in 2018 have increased over the comparable three and six month periods of 2017 primarily due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth within both the Digital Media and Cloud Services segments.
Sales and Marketing.
2018 was $74.7 million (primarily consists of $48.9 million of third-party advertising costs and $20.3 million of personnel costs) compared to 2017 of $66.0 million (primarily consists of $43.7 million of third-party advertising costs and $20.1 million of personnel costs). The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 versus the prior comparable periods was primarily due to increased personnel costs and advertising associated with the acquisition of businesses acquired in and subsequent to the second quarter 2017 within the Digital Media segment.
Research, Development and Engineering.
Our general and administrative costs consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, depreciation and amortization, changes in the fair value associated with contingent consideration, share-based compensation expense, bad debt expense, professional fees, severance and insurance costs. The increase in general and administrative expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 versus the prior comparable periods was primarily due to additional amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of fixed assets, personnel costs relating to businesses acquired in and subsequent to the second quarter 2017, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, severance costs associated with acquisitions and professional fees.
Other expense, net. Our other expense, net is generated primarily from miscellaneous items, gain or losses on currency exchange and gains or losses on investments. Other expense, net was $0.4 million and $4.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease over the prior comparable period is due to decreased losses on currency exchange. Other expense, net was $4.9 million and $4.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase is primarily due to a loss on equity investments of $3.7 million; partially offset by decreased losses on currency exchange over the prior comparable period.
Provision for income taxes amounted to $7.0 million and $9.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $14.1 million and $18.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 18.3% and 22.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 21.8% and 24.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on segment revenues, including both external and intersegment net sales, and segment operating income. We account for intersegment sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the segments. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segment’s operations. Corporate assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes and certain other assets. All significant intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at our consolidated financial results.
Cloud Services’ net sales of $150.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $5.6 million, or 3.9%, and segment net sales of $299.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased $13.5 million, or 4.7%, from the prior comparable periods due to business acquisitions.
Cloud Services’ gross profit of $119.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $4.8 million, or 4.2%, and segment gross profit of $238.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased $10.9 million, or 4.8%, from the prior comparable periods primarily due to business acquisitions.
Cloud Services’ operating expenses of $61.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $4.8 million, and segment operating expenses of $123.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased $10.2 million, from the prior comparable periods primarily due to (a) additional expense associated with businesses acquired in and subsequent to the prior comparable period (b) increased bad debt expense; and (c) an allocation of certain shared Corporate operating costs. 
As a result of these factors, segment operating income of $58.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $0.1 million, or 0.1%, and segment operating income of $115.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased $0.7 million, or 0.6% from the prior comparable periods.

Digital Media’s gross profit of $120.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $5.3 million, or 4.6%, and segment gross profit of $234.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased $17.9 million, or 8.2%, from the prior comparable periods primarily due to business acquisitions.

comparable periods primarily due to (a) additional expense associated with businesses acquired in and subsequent to the prior comparable period comprised primarily of salary and related costs, marketing costs, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and amortization of intangible assets; and (b) an allocation of certain shared Corporate operating costs. 
As a result of these factors, segment operating income (loss) of $3.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 decreased $6.9 million, or 68.3%, and segment operating income (loss) of $(0.2) million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 decreased $6.8 million, or 103.1% from the prior comparable periods.
At June 30, 2018, we had cash and investments of $428.0 million compared to $408.7 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in cash and investments resulted primarily from cash from operations, partially offset by business acquisitions, dividends and interest paid, and purchases of property and equipment. At June 30, 2018, cash and investments consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $357.4 million. We retain a substantial portion of our cash and investments in foreign jurisdictions for future reinvestment. As of June 30, 2018, cash and investments held within domestic and foreign jurisdictions were $215.1 million and $212.9 million, respectively. If the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay non-U.S withholding taxes upon repatriation in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
On February 2, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.4050 per share of common stock payable on March 9, 2018 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2018. On May 3, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.4150 per share of j2 Global common stock payable on June 1, 2018 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 18, 2018.

During 2018, the Company received capital call notices from the management of OCV Management, LLC. for $34.6 million, inclusive of certain management fees, of which $21.7 million has been paid for the six months ended June 30, 2018. 
We currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditure, stock repurchases and cash dividends for at least the next 12 months.
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations, together with cash and cash equivalents. Net cash provided by operating activities was $206.3 million and $111.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our operating cash flows resulted primarily from cash received from our customers offset by cash payments we made to third parties for their services, employee compensation and interest payments associated with our debt. The increase in our net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable and increased depreciation and amortization; partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $357.8 million and $350.9 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Net cash used in investing activities was $154.1 million and $56.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to business acquisitions, capital expenditures associated with the purchase of property and equipment and the purchase of investments. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to business acquisitions 
and capital expenditures associated with the purchase of property and equipment. The increase in our net cash used in investing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to additional business acquisitions.
Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(43.2) million and $411.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to dividends paid, repurchases of stock and business acquisitions. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, additional borrowings under our line of credit and exercise of stock options; partially offset by the repayment in full of the line of credit, dividends paid, repurchases of stock and business acquisitions. The change in net cash used in financing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt; partially offset by the net payment associated with the payment in full of our line of credit in the prior comparable period.
In February 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a program authorizing the repurchase of up to five million shares of our common stock through February 20, 2013 (the “2012 Program”) which was subsequently extended through February 19, 2019. During the six month period ended June 30, 2018, we repurchased zero shares under this program. Cumulatively at June 30, 2018, 2.1 million shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of $58.6 million (including an immaterial amount of commission fees).
As of June 30, 2018, our liability for uncertain tax positions was $54.5 million. The future payments related to uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with such authorities. 
We have not presented contingent consideration associated with acquisitions in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and the timing of cash settlements.
We are not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements.

In July 2016, the Company acquired and subsequently retired 935,231 shares of j2 Global common stock in connection with the acquisition of Integrated Global Concepts, Inc. As a result of the purchase of j2 Global common stock, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a reduction in the number of shares available for purchase under the 2012 Program by the same amount leaving 1,938,689 shares of j2 Global common stock available for purchase under this program.
