Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019
Cloud Services
Assuming a stable or improving economic environment, and, subject to our risk factors, we expect the revenue and profits in our Digital Media business to improve over the next several quarters as we integrate our recent acquisitions and over the longer term as advertising transactions continue to shift from offline to online. The main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to visitors to our websites and those included within our advertising networks, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and those included within our advertising networks.
The operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our websites is significantly higher than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from those placed on third-party websites. Growth in advertising revenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from third-party websites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future. However, the trend in advertising spend is shifting to mobile devices and other newer advertising formats which generally experience lower margins than those from desktop computers and tablets. We expect this trend to continue to put pressure on our margins.
Revenues
Our revenues consist of revenues from our Cloud Services business and from our Digital Media business. Cloud Services revenues primarily consist of revenues from “fixed” customer subscription revenues and “variable” revenues generated from actual usage of our services. We also generate Cloud Services revenues from IP licensing. Digital Media revenues primarily consist of advertising revenues, subscriptions earned through the granting of access to, or delivery of, certain data products or services to customers, fees paid for generating business leads, and licensing and sale of editorial content and trademarks.
Our revenues in 2019 have increased over the comparable three and nine month periods of 2018 primarily due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth within both the Digital Media and Cloud Services businesses.

The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 versus the prior comparable periods was primarily due to increased personnel costs and advertising associated with the acquisition of businesses acquired in and subsequent to the third quarter 2018 within the Media and Cloud Services businesses.

General and Administrative.
Our general and administrative costs consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, depreciation and amortization, changes in the fair value associated with contingent consideration, share-based compensation expense, bad debt expense, professional fees, severance and insurance costs. The increase in general and administrative expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 versus the prior comparable periods was primarily due to additional amortization of intangible assets, increased depreciation expense, personnel costs relating to businesses acquired in and subsequent to the third quarter 2018; partially offset by lower bad debt expense.

At September 30, 2019, we had cash and investments of $189.0 million compared to $293.3 million at December 31, 2018.

At September 30, 2019, cash and investments consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $92.2 million and long-term investments of $96.8 million. Our investments consist of equity and debt securities.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $309.3 million and $294.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our operating cash flows resulted primarily from cash received from our customers offset by cash payments we made to third parties for their services, employee compensation and interest payments associated with our debt. The increase in our net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses; partially offset by lower uncertain tax position, higher tax payments, an increase in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets and reduced deferred revenue.

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $46.9 million and $(67.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from the line of credit and exercise of stock options; partially offset by cash used 
for the repayment of the line of credit and note payable, business acquisitions, repurchase of common stock and dividends paid. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to dividends paid, repurchases of stock and business acquisitions.
