Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2019
Cloud Services
Assuming a stable or improving economic environment, and, subject to our risk factors, we expect the revenue and profits in our Digital Media business to improve over the next several quarters as we integrate our recent acquisitions and over the longer term as advertising transactions continue to shift from offline to online. The main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to visitors to our websites and those included within our advertising networks, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and those included within our advertising networks.
The operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our websites is significantly higher than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from those placed on third-party websites. Growth in advertising revenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from third-party websites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future. However, the trend in advertising spend is shifting to mobile devices and other newer advertising formats which generally experience lower margins than those from desktop computers and tablets. We expect this trend to continue to put pressure on our margins.
Revenues
Our revenues consist of revenues from our Cloud Services business and from our Digital Media business. Cloud Services revenues primarily consist of revenues from “fixed” customer subscription revenues and “variable” revenues generated from actual usage of our services. We also generate Cloud Services revenues from IP licensing. Digital Media revenues primarily consist of advertising revenues, subscriptions earned through the granting of access to, or delivery of, certain data products or services to customers, fees paid for generating business leads, and licensing and sale of editorial content and trademarks.
Our revenues in 2019 have increased over the comparable three and six month periods of 2018 primarily due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth within both the Digital Media and Cloud Services businesses.
Cost of Revenues
Operating Expenses
Sales and Marketing.
Research, Development and Engineering.
General and Administrative.
Our general and administrative costs consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, depreciation and amortization, changes in the fair value associated with contingent consideration, share-based compensation expense, bad debt expense, professional fees, severance and insurance costs. The increase in general and administrative expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 versus the prior comparable period was primarily due to additional amortization of intangible assets, increased depreciation expense, personnel costs relating to businesses acquired in and subsequent to the second quarter 2018; partially offset by lower bad debt expense.
Share-Based Compensation
Non-Operating Income and Expenses
Interest expense, net. Our interest expense, net is generated primarily from interest expense due to outstanding debt, partially offset by interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest expense, net was $17.3 million and $15.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $33.4 million and $31.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interest expense, net increased over the prior comparable periods primarily due to our line of credit borrowings.
Other (income) expense, net. Our other (income) expense, net is generated primarily from miscellaneous items, gain or losses on currency exchange and gains or losses on investments. Other (income) expense, net was $(0.4) million and $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $1.8 million and $4.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Other (income) expense, net decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2019 versus the prior comparable period primarily due to reduced losses on currency exchange. Other (income) expense, net decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2019 versus the prior comparable period primarily due to decreased losses on equity securities and reduced losses on currency exchange.
Provision for income taxes amounted to $11.1 million and $7.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $10.9 million and $14.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 28.1% and 18.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 15.0% and 21.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Equity Method Investment
Net (income) loss in earnings of equity method investment. Net (income) loss in earnings of equity method investment is generated from our investment in the OCV Fund for which we receive annual audited financial statements. The investment in the OCV Fund is presented net of tax and on a one-quarter lag due to the timing and availability of financial information from OCV. If the Company becomes aware of a significant decline in value that is other-than-temporary, the loss will be recorded in the period in which the Company identifies the decline.
The net (income) loss in earnings of equity method investment was $(4.1) million and $3.0 million, net of tax benefit for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $(3.6) million and $3.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized management fees of $0.8 million and $3.0 million, net of tax benefit, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized management fees of $1.5 million and $3.0 million, net of tax benefit, respectively.
Cloud Services and Digital Media Results
We evaluate the performance of our businesses based on revenues, including both external and interbusiness net sales, and operating income. We account for interbusiness sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the businesses. Identifiable assets by business are those assets used in the respective business’s operations. Corporate assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes and certain other assets. All significant interbusiness amounts are eliminated to arrive at our consolidated financial results.

Also, Digital Media incurred an increased allocation of certain shared Corporate operating costs in comparison to the prior comparable periods. 
As a result of these factors, Digital Media’s operating income of $1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 decreased $1.7 million, or 52.3%, and operating income (loss) of $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased $0.7 million, or 349.0%, from the prior comparable periods.
At June 30, 2019, we had cash and investments of $259.5 million compared to $293.3 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash and investments resulted primarily from cash used in business acquisitions, dividends paid and purchases of property and equipment; partially offset by cash from provided by operating activities and proceeds from the line of credit. At June 30, 2019, cash and investments consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $155.5 million and long-term investments of $104.0 million. Our investments consist of equity and debt securities. For financial statement presentation, we classify our debt securities primarily as short- and long-term based upon their maturity dates. Short-term investments mature within one year of the date of the financial statements and long-term investments mature one year or more from the date of the financial statements. As of June 30, 2019, cash and investments held within domestic and foreign jurisdictions were $196.8 million and $62.7 million, respectively. 
On January 7, 2019, J2 Cloud Services, LLC entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with certain lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the “Lenders”) and MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as sole lead arranger and as administrative agent for the Lenders (the “Agent”). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Lenders have provided J2 Cloud Services with a credit facility of $100.0 million (the “Credit Facility”) with an option to request an increase of up to $50.0 million. On July 1, 2019, the Company increased its Credit Facility to $150.0 million (see Note 17 - Subsequent Events of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).The proceeds of the Credit Facility are intended to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of J2 Cloud and its subsidiaries, including to finance certain permitted acquisitions and capital expenditures in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had drawn $100.0 million on the Credit Facility.
On February 6, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.4450 per share of J2 Global common stock payable on March 12, 2019 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 25, 2019. On May 2, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.4550 per share of J2 Global common stock payable on June 4, 2019 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 20, 2019. Future dividends are subject to Board approval. However, based on the significant number of current investment opportunities within the Company’s portfolio of businesses and the historic returns from prior investments, the Board of Directors suspended dividend payments for the foreseeable future after the June 4, 2019 payment.
During the first six months of 2019, the Company received capital call notices from the management of OCV Management, LLC. for $19.3 million, inclusive of certain management fees, of which $14.7 million has been paid for the six months ended June 30, 2019. 
We currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditure, stock repurchases and cash dividends for at least the next 12 months.
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations, together with cash and cash equivalents. Net cash provided by operating activities was $212.2 million and $206.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our operating cash flows resulted primarily from cash received from our customers offset by cash payments we made to third parties for their services, employee compensation and interest payments associated with our debt. The increase in our net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to increased depreciation and amortization and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses; partially offset by lower uncertain tax position, increased tax payments and reduced deferred revenue. Our cash and cash equivalents were $155.5 million and $209.5 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
Net cash used in investing activities was $311.5 million and $154.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to business acquisitions, capital expenditures associated with the purchase of property and equipment and the purchase of investments. The increase in our net cash used in investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to business acquisitions.
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $44.8 million and $(43.2) million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from the line of credit and exercise of stock options; partially offset by cash used for business acquisitions and dividends paid. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to dividends paid, repurchases of stock and business acquisitions. The change in net cash used in financing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to the proceeds from the line of credit; partially offset by business acquisitions and the payment of dividends.

We are not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements.
Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
