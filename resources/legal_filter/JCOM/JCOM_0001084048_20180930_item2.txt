◦Sustain growth or profitability, particularly in light of an uncertain U.S. or worldwide economy and the related impact on customer acquisition and retention rates, customer usage levels, and credit and debit card payment declines;
Our Cloud Services segment generates revenues primarily from customer subscription and usage fees and from IP licensing fees. Our Digital Media segment generates revenues from advertising and sponsorships, subscription and usage fees, performance marketing and licensing fees.
In addition to growing our business organically, on a regular basis we acquire businesses to grow our customer bases, expand and diversify our service offerings, enhance our technologies, acquire skilled personnel and enter into new markets. 
Assuming a stable or improving economic environment, and subject to our risk factors, we expect the revenue and profits in our Digital Media segment to improve over the next several quarters as we integrate our recent acquisitions and over the longer term as advertising transactions continue to shift from offline to online. The main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to visitors to our websites and those included within our advertising networks, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and those included within our advertising networks.
The operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our websites is significantly higher than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from those placed on third-party websites. Growth in advertising revenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from third-party websites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future. However, the trend in advertising spend is shifting to mobile devices and other newer advertising formats which generally experience lower margins than those from desktop computers and tablets. We expect this trend to continue to put pressure on our margins.
We anticipate that the stable revenue trend in our Cloud Services segment combined with the improving revenue and profits in our Digital Media segment will result in overall improved revenue and profits for j2 Global on a consolidated basis, excluding the impact of any future acquisitions which can vary dramatically from period to period. 
Our revenues consist of revenues from our Cloud Services segment and from our Digital Media segment. Cloud Services revenues primarily consist of revenues from “fixed” customer subscription revenues and “variable” revenues generated from actual usage of our services. We also generate Cloud Services revenues from IP licensing. Digital Media revenues is primarily derived from advertising revenues and subscription to services and information revenues consisting of fees paid for generating business leads, and licensing and sale of editorial content and trademarks.
Our revenues in 2018 have increased over the comparable three and nine month periods of 2017 primarily due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth within both the Digital Media and Cloud Services segments.
Cost of revenues is primarily comprised of costs associated with data and voice transmission, numbers, editorial and production costs, network operations, customer service, online processing fees and equipment depreciation. The increase in cost of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with businesses acquired in and subsequent to the third quarter 2017 that resulted in additional editorial and production, network operations, and online processing fees.
Sales and Marketing.
Our sales and marketing costs consist primarily of internet-based advertising, sales and marketing, personnel costs and other business development-related expenses. Our internet-based advertising relationships consist primarily of fixed cost and performance-based (cost-per-impression, cost-per-click and cost-per-acquisition) advertising relationships with an array of online service providers. Advertising cost for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was $36.3 million (primarily consists of $24.4 million of third-party advertising costs and $10.2 million of personnel costs) compared to 2017 of $35.7 million (primarily consists of $24.1 million of third-party advertising costs and $10.4 million of personnel costs). Advertising cost for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $111.0 million (primarily consists of $73.2 million of third-party advertising costs and $30.6 million of personnel costs) compared to 2017 of $101.7 million (primarily consists of $67.8 million of third-party advertising costs and $30.5 million of personnel costs). The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 
versus the prior comparable periods was primarily due to increased personnel costs and advertising associated with the acquisition of businesses acquired in and subsequent to the third quarter 2017 within the Digital Media segment.
Research, Development and Engineering.
Our general and administrative costs consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, depreciation and amortization, changes in the fair value associated with contingent consideration, share-based compensation expense, bad debt expense, professional fees, severance and insurance costs. The increase in general and administrative expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 versus the prior comparable periods was primarily due to additional amortization of intangible assets,
value adjustments to contingent consideration, severance costs associated with acquisitions and professional fees.
Interest expense, net. Our interest expense, net is generated primarily from interest expense due to outstanding debt, partially offset by interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest expense, net was $15.2 million and $25.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $46.4 million and $51.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest expense, net decreased over the prior comparable periods primarily due to decreased interest expense associated with the extinguishment and loss of the $250 million 8.0% Senior Notes, partially offset by increased interest income on cash, cash equivalents and investments.
Other expense (income), net. Our other expense (income), net is generated primarily from miscellaneous items, gain or losses on currency exchange and gains or losses on investments. Other expense (income), net was $1.2 million and $(3.9) million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in expense over the prior comparable period is due to increased losses on currency exchange in the current period compared to the prior period’s gains earned related to the sales of Cambridge BioMarketing Group, LLC (“Cambridge”) and j2 Australia Hosting Pty Ltd (dba “Web24”). Other expense (income), net was $6.2 million and $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in expense over the prior comparable period is due to a loss on equity securities of $3.7 million partially offset by decreased losses on currency exchange compared to the prior period’s gain related to the sales of Cambridge BioMarketing Group, LLC (“Cambridge”) and j2 Australia Hosting Pty Ltd (dba “Web24”).

We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on segment revenues, including both external and intersegment net sales, and segment operating income. We account for intersegment sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the segments. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segment’s operations. Corporate assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes and certain other assets. All significant intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at our consolidated financial results.
