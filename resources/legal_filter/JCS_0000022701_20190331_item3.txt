Item 3.
The Company has no freestanding or embedded derivatives.
The Companyâ€™s policy is to not use freestanding derivatives and to not enter into contracts with terms that cannot be designated as normal purchases or sales.
The vast majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars; as such, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have historically not been material to the Company.
At March 31, 2019 our bank line of credit carried a variable interest rate based on LIBOR plus 2.0%.
As noted above, we had no outstanding borrowings at March 31, 2019.
