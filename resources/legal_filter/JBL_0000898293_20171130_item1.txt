JABIL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  



NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  



(Unaudited)  



1.
Basis of Presentation  



The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S.
GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the information set forth therein have been included.
2.
Earnings Per Share and Dividends  



Earnings Per Share  



The Company calculates its basic earnings per share by dividing net income attributable to Jabil Inc. by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
The Companys diluted earnings per share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the effect of dilutive securities.
The difference between the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding and the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding is primarily due to dilutive unvested restricted stock awards and dilutive stock appreciation rights.
Performance-based restricted stock awards are considered dilutive when the related performance criterion have been met assuming the end of the reporting period represents the end of the performance period.
Inventories  



Inventories consist of the following (in thousands):

4.
Stock-Based Compensation  



The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense within selling, general and administrative expense as follows  



(in thousands):  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 (1) Represents a one-time cash-settled stock award that vested on November 30, 2017.
As of November 30, 2017, the shares available to be issued under the 2011 Stock Award and Incentive Plan were 12,327,622.
Restricted Stock Awards  



Certain key employees have been granted time-based, performance-based and market-based restricted stock unit awards.
The time-based restricted stock units generally vest on a graded vesting schedule over three years.
The performance-based restricted stock units generally vest on a cliff vesting schedule over three years and up to a maximum of 150%, depending on the specified performance condition and the level of achievement obtained.
The market-based restricted stock units generally vest on a cliff vesting schedule over three years and up to a maximum of 200%, depending on the specified performance condition and the level of achievement obtained.
The market-based restricted stock units have a vesting condition that is tied to the Companys stock performance in relation to the Standard and Poors (S&P) Super Composite Technology Hardware and Equipment Index.
During the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company awarded approximately 1.3 million and 1.0 million time-based restricted stock units, respectively, 0.4 million and 0.6 million performance-based restricted stock units, respectively and 0.4 million and 0.4 million market-based stock units, respectively.
On October 6, 2017, the Companys Compensation Committee approved the modification of vesting criteria for certain performance-based restricted stock awards granted in fiscal year 2015.
As a result of the modification, 0.8 million awards vested during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, which resulted in approximately $24.9 million of stock-based compensation expense recognized for the three months ended November 30, 2017.
The following represents the stock-based compensation information for the period indicated (in thousands):

Concentration of Risk and Segment Data  



Concentration of Risk  



Sales of the Companys products are concentrated among specific customers.
During the three months ended November 30, 2017, the Companys five largest customers accounted for approximately 51% of its net revenue and 74 customers accounted for approximately 90% of its net revenue.
The Company procures components from a broad group of suppliers.
Segment Data  



Net revenue for the operating segments is attributed to the segment in which the service is performed.
An operating segments performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income.
Total segment assets are defined as accounts receivable, inventories, net customer-related property, plant and equipment, intangible assets net of accumulated amortization and goodwill.
All other non-segment assets are reviewed on a global basis by management.
Transactions between operating segments are generally recorded at amounts that approximate those at which we would transact with third parties.

The following tables set forth operating segment information (in thousands):  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of November 30, 2017, the Company operated in 29 countries worldwide.
Sales to unaffiliated customers are based on the Companys location that maintains the customer relationship and transacts the external sale.
Total foreign net revenue represented 92.3% of net revenue during both the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016.
6.
Notes Payable, Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations  



Notes payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations outstanding as of November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017 are summarized below (in thousands):  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 (1)  The notes are carried at the principal amount of each note, less any unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs.
9  



Table of Contents 



 (2)  The Senior Notes are the Companys senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations.
(3)  On November 8, 2017, the Company entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured five-year credit agreement.
The credit agreement provides for: (i) the Revolving Credit Facility in the initial amount of $1.8 billion, which may, subject to the lenders discretion, potentially be increased up to $2.3 billion and (ii) a $500.0 million Term Loan Facility (collectively the Credit Facility).
The Credit Facility expires on November 8, 2022.
The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to two whole or partial one-year extensions, at the lenders discretion.
Interest and fees on the Credit Facility advances are based on the Companys non-credit enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt rating as determined by Standard & Poors Ratings Service, Moodys Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.
During the three months ended November 30, 2017, the interest rates on the Revolving Credit Facility ranged from 2.4% to 4.4% and the interest rates on the Term Loan Facility ranged from 2.6% to 2.7%.
Interest is charged at a rate equal to (a) for the Revolving Credit Facility, either 0.000% to 0.575% above the base rate or 0.975% to 1.575% above the Eurocurrency rate and (b) for the Term Loan Facility, either 0.125% to 0.875% above the base rate or 1.125% to 1.875% above the Eurocurrency rate.
The base rate represents the greatest of: (i) Citibank, N.A.s base rate, (ii) 0.50% above the federal funds rate, and (iii) 1.0% above one-month LIBOR, but not less than zero.
The Eurocurrency rate represents adjusted LIBOR or adjusted CDOR, as applicable, for the applicable interest period, but not less than zero.
Fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders and a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit.
As of November 30, 2017, the Company has $2.2 billion in available unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities.
In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility and 4.900% Senior Notes contain debt leverage and interest coverage covenants.
The Company is also subject to a covenant requiring the repurchase of the 8.250%, 5.625%, or 4.700% Senior Notes upon a change of control.
As of November 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants.
Fair Value  



The estimated fair values of the Companys publicly traded debt, including the 8.250%, 5.625% and 4.700% senior notes, were approximately $405.6 million, $431.2 million and $525.3 million, respectively, as of November 30, 2017.
The fair value estimates are based upon observable market data (Level 2 criteria).
The estimated fair value of the Companys private debt, the 4.900% senior notes, was approximately $311.7 million, as of November 30, 2017.
This fair value estimate is based on the Companys indicative borrowing cost derived from discounted cash flows (Level 3 criteria).
The carrying amounts of borrowings under credit facilities and under loans approximate fair value as interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates.
7.
Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization and Sale Programs  



The Company regularly sells designated pools of trade accounts receivable under two asset-backed securitization programs and five uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs (collectively referred to herein as the programs).
The Company continues servicing the receivables sold and in exchange receives a servicing fee under each of the programs.
Servicing fees related to each of the programs recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016 were not material.
The Company does not record a servicing asset or liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company estimates that the fee it receives to service these receivables approximates the fair market compensation to provide the servicing activities.
Asset-Backed Securitization Programs  



The Company continuously sells designated pools of trade accounts receivable, at a discount, under its North American asset-backed securitization program and its foreign asset-backed securitization program (collectively referred to herein as the asset-backed securitization programs) to special purpose entities, which in turn sell 100% of the receivables to: (i) conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions for the North American asset-backed securitization program and (ii) to an unaffiliated financial institution and a conduit administered by an unaffiliated financial institution for the foreign asset-backed securitization program.
Any portion of the purchase price for the receivables not paid in cash upon the sale occurring is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid from available cash as payments on the receivables are collected.
10  



Table of Contents 



The special purpose entity in the North American asset-backed securitization program is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
The special purpose entity in the foreign asset-backed securitization program is a separate bankruptcy-remote entity whose assets would be first available to satisfy the creditor claims of the unaffiliated financial institution.
The Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of this special purpose entity as the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive the benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity from the transfer of the trade accounts receivable into the special purpose entity.
Accordingly, the special purpose entities associated with these asset-backed securitization programs are included in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Following is a summary of the asset-backed securitization programs and key terms:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 (1) Maximum amount available at any one time.
(2) On November 9, 2017, the program was extended to October 20, 2020.
(2) Recorded to other expense within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
(3) Recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are valued using unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs), primarily discounted cash flows, and due to their credit quality and short-term maturity the fair values approximated book values.
The unobservable inputs consist of estimated credit losses and estimated discount rates, which both have an immaterial impact on the fair value calculations.
The asset-backed securitization programs require compliance with several covenants.
The North American asset-based securitization program covenants include compliance with the interest ratio and debt to EBITDA ratio of the Credit Facility.
As of November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the asset-backed securitization programs.

Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs  



The following is a summary of the five trade accounts receivable sale programs with unaffiliated financial institutions where the Company may elect to sell receivables, at a discount, on an ongoing basis:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 (1) Maximum amount available at any one time.
(2) The maximum amount under the program will be reduced to $650.0 million on February 1, 2018.
(3) Any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice.
8.
(2) $3.5 million of AOCI reclassified into earnings during the three months ended November 30, 2017 for derivative instruments was classified as a reduction of income tax expense.
The remaining amount reclassified into earnings was primarily classified as a component of cost of revenue.
$11.3 million expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months will be classified as a reduction of income tax expense.
The remaining amount expected to be reclassified into earnings will be classified as a component of cost of revenue.
The annual tax benefit (expense) for unrealized gains on derivative instruments is not material for the three months ended November 30, 2017.
(3) There is no tax benefit (expense) related to the available for sale securities components of AOCI, including reclassification adjustments, for the three months ended November 30, 2017.

Commitments and Contingencies  



The Company is party to certain lawsuits in the ordinary course of business.
The Company disagrees with the proposed adjustments and intends to vigorously contest these matters through the applicable IRS administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate.
As the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain, the Company continues to provide for the uncertain tax positions based on the more likely than not standard.
However, there can be no assurance that managements beliefs will be realized.
10.
Foreign Currency Risk Management  



Forward contracts are put in place to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses.
A hedging relationship existed with an aggregate notional amount outstanding of $480.7 million and $314.6 million as of November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, respectively.
The related forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
In addition to derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments and qualify for hedge accounting, the Company also enters into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, fixed purchase obligations and intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity.
The aggregate notional amount of these outstanding contracts as of November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, was $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.
The following table presents the Companys assets and liabilities related to forward foreign exchange contracts measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of November 30, 2017, aggregated by the level in the fair-value hierarchy in which those measurements are classified (in thousands):  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The Companys forward foreign exchange contracts are measured on a recurring basis at fair value, based on foreign currency spot rates and forward rates quoted by banks or foreign currency dealers.
Interest Rate Risk Management  



The Company periodically enters into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with the Companys borrowings.
Cash Flow Hedges  



During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company entered into forward starting swap transactions to hedge the fixed interest rate payments for an anticipated debt issuance.
The forward starting swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $200.0 million and have been designated as hedging instruments and accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The forward starting swaps are scheduled to expire on March 15, 2018.
If the anticipated debt issuance occurs before March 15, 2018, the contracts will be terminated simultaneously with the debt issuance.
The contracts will be settled with the respective counterparties on a net basis at the time of termination or expiration.
Changes in the fair value of the forward starting swap transactions are recorded on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of AOCI.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company entered into interest rate swap transactions to hedge the variable interest rate payments for the Term Loan Facility.
In connection with this transaction, the Company will pay interest based upon a fixed rate as agreed upon with the respective counterparties and receive variable rate interest payments based on the one-month LIBOR.
The interest rate swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $200.0 million and have been designated as hedging instruments and accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The interest rate swaps were effective on September 30, 2016 and are scheduled to expire on June 30, 2019.
The contracts will be settled with the respective counterparties on a net basis at each settlement date.
Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap transactions are recorded on the Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of AOCI.

New Accounting Guidance  



Recently Issued Accounting Guidance  



During fiscal year 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard which will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP.
The new standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
The accounting standard is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this standard.
The Company has determined that the new standard will result in a change to the timing of the Companys revenue recognition policy for certain customer contracts to an over time model as opposed to a point in time model upon delivery.
Under the new standard, such up-front costs would be recognized as an asset and amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of the goods to which the asset relates.
The financial impacts of the new standard cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
The Company expects to adopt the new guidance under the modified retrospective approach.
During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Early application is permitted only for certain provisions, and the update must be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the standard.
During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard revising lease accounting.
The new guidance requires organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and disclose key information regarding leasing arrangements.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
Early application of the new standard is permitted and the standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach.
The adoption of this standard will impact the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet.
During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard, which replaces the existing incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
This guidance must be applied using a modified retrospective or prospective transition method, depending on the area covered by this accounting standard.
During fiscal year 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to address the presentation of certain transactions within the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and early adoption is permitted.
The new standard eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory and requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences when the transfer occurs.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and early adoption is permitted.
This guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that clarifies the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and will be applied on a prospective basis.
Early application is permitted for certain transactions.
During fiscal year 2017, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge.
Goodwill will be considered impaired when the carrying amount of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early application permitted.
The guidance will be applied on a prospective basis.
