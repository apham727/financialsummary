Business Description



We are a signal transmission solutions provider built around two global business platforms – Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions.
Our comprehensive portfolio of signal transmission solutions provides industry leading secure and reliable transmission of data, sound, and video for mission critical applications.
Reporting Periods



Our fiscal year and fiscal fourth quarter both end on December 31.
Our fiscal first quarter ends on the Sunday falling closest to 91 days after December 31, which was April 1, 2018, the 91st day of our fiscal year 2018.
Our fiscal second and third quarters each have 91 days.
The three months ended April 2, 2017 included 92 days.
Operating Segments



Effective January 1, 2018, we changed our organizational structure and, as a result, now are reporting two segments.
The segments formerly known as Broadcast Solutions and Enterprise Solutions now are presented as the Enterprise Solutions segment, and the segments formerly known as Industrial Solutions and Network Solutions now are presented as the Industrial Solutions segment.
The reorganization allows us to further accelerate progress in key strategic areas and the segment consolidation properly aligns our external reporting with the way the businesses are now managed.
We have recast the prior period segment information to conform to the change in the composition of these reportable segments.
Reclassifications



We have made certain reclassifications to the 2017 Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements including for the adoption of ASU 2017-07 and for our segment change with no impact to reported net income in order to conform to the 2018 presentation.
See Note 5.
Interim Periods of 2017



During the financial closing process for the fourth quarter of 2017, we determined that certain consolidated financial statement amounts were not recorded correctly in prior interim periods of 2017.
We evaluated these errors and concluded that they were not material to any of our previously issued interim financial statements and did not require restatement of the quarters.
The errors primarily related to recognizing revenue prior to satisfying all of the delivery criteria in one business within our Enterprise segment.
All of the errors were corrected as of December 31, 2017.
The impact of the errors in the first quarter of 2017 was an overstatement of revenues and net income of $6.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively.
The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows:



•Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;



•Level 2 – Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and



•Level 3 – Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
As of and during the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, we utilized Level 1 inputs to determine the fair value of cash equivalents, and we utilized Level 2 and Level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations (see Note 3).
We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017.
Cash and Cash Equivalents



We classify cash on hand and deposits in banks, including commercial paper, money market accounts, and other investments with an original maturity of three months or less, that we hold from time to time, as cash and cash equivalents.
We periodically have cash equivalents consisting of short-term money market funds and other investments.
As of April 1, 2018, we did not have any such cash equivalents on hand.
The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations.
Contingent Liabilities



We have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies that are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable, the amounts of which are currently not material.
We accrue environmental remediation costs based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposures developed in consultation with our environmental consultants and legal counsel.
We are, from time to time, subject to routine litigation incidental to our business.
As of April 1, 2018, we were party to standby letters of credit, bank guaranties, and surety bonds totaling $7.3 million, $2.7 million, and $2.4 million, respectively.
Contingent Gain



On July 5, 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary, PPC Broadband, Inc. (PPC), filed an action for patent infringement against Corning Optical Communications RF LLC (Corning).
In July 2015, a jury found that Corning willfully infringed both patents.
In November 2016, following a series of post-trial motions, the trial judge issued rulings for a total judgment in our favor of approximately $61.3 million.
In December 2016, Corning appealed the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
In March 2018, a panel of three judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a Rule 36 Affirmance, without written opinion, of the District Court's final judgment that Corning, among other things, willfully infringed the PPC universal compression patents at issue in the case, and that PPC should be awarded about $61.8 million as a result.
On April 12, 2018, Corning filed a petition for re-hearing.
We have not recorded any amounts in our consolidated financial statements related to this matter.
Revenue Recognition



We recognize revenue consistent with the principles as outlined in the following five step model: (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.
- 6-



Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations.
For such arrangements, we allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.
Generally, the standalone selling prices are determined based upon the prices charged to customers.
We record revisions to these estimates in the period in which the facts that give rise to each revision become known.
We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance.
The term between invoicing and when payment is due is generally not significant.
For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.
Sales commissions for which the related service or support contract extends beyond one year are capitalized in other current or long-lived assets and recognized as expense over the related service or support period.
In the event the related service or support period is twelve months or less, we apply the practical expedient and expense the sales commissions when incurred.
Current-Year Adoption of Accounting Pronouncements



In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP.
The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services.
We adopted ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method of adoption.
Adoption resulted in a $2.6 million, net of tax increase to retained earnings.
This adjustment primarily relates to the deferral of costs to obtain a contract that were previously expensed at the beginning of the contract period.
In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
The new guidance addresses how the following eight specific cash flow items are to be presented: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.
We adopted ASU 2016-15 on January 1, 2018.
Adoption had no material impact on our statement of cash flows during the quarter ended April 1, 2018.
In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (ASU 2016-16), which requires recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
Consequently, the standard eliminates the exception to the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer other than for inventory until the asset has been sold to an outside party.
We adopted ASU 2016-16 on January 1, 2018.
Adoption resulted in a $3.0 million and $46.9 million decrease to other current assets and other long-lived assets, respectively, as well as an $18.2 million increase in deferred income tax assets and a $31.7 million decrease to retained earnings on January 1, 2018.
In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (ASU 2017-07), which requires an entity to report the service cost component in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from the service rendered by their employees during the period.
The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the Statement of 



 - 7-



Operations separately from the service cost component after Operating Income.
Additionally, only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization, when applicable.
The standard requires the amendments to be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other cost components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic OPEB cost in the Statement of Operations and prospectively, on and after the effective date, for the capitalization of the service cost component of net periodic pension and OPEB costs.
We adopted ASU 2017-07 on January 1, 2018, and elected to use the practical expedient related to the retrospective presentation requirements.
Adoption resulted in a $0.3 million increase to operating income, but no change to net income during the quarter ended April 2, 2017.
Pending Adoption of Recent Accounting Pronouncements



In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-02, Leases (ASU 2016-02), a leasing standard for both lessees and lessors.
Under its core principle, a lessee will recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all arrangements with terms longer than 12 months.
Lessor accounting remains largely consistent with existing U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The new standard will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2019.
Early adoption is permitted.
The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition method.
In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.
The new guidance also makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance and ease the administrative burden of hedge documentation requirements and assessing hedge effectiveness.
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted.
The guidance indicates that either accounting for deferred taxes related to GILTI inclusions or to treat any taxes on GILTI inclusions as a period cost are both acceptable methods subject to an accounting policy election.
Pending further anticipated clarification and guidance related to the application of the GILTI provisions and their impact to Belden, we intend to further assess the materiality of the anticipated GILTI inclusion before making a policy election.
Note 2: Revenues



On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.
Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
We recorded a net increase to retained earnings of $2.6 million as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, with the impact primarily related to sales commissions and software revenues within our Industrial Solutions segment.
The impact to revenues for the three months ended April 1, 2018 was a decrease of $0.1 million as a result of applying Topic 606.
The following tables present our revenues disaggregated by major product category.
- 8-



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The following tables present our revenues disaggregated by geography, based on the location of the customer purchasing the product.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The following tables present our revenues disaggregated by products, including software products, and support and services.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We generate revenues primarily by selling products that provide secure and reliable transmission of data, sound, and video for mission critical applications.
We also generate revenues from providing support and professional services.
We sell our products to distributors, end-users, installers, and directly to original equipment manufacturers.
At times, we enter into arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple performance obligations.
For these arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative selling price and recognized when or as each performance obligation is satisfied.
Generally, we determine relative selling price using the prices charged to customers.
As a result, we recognized an increase to revenues of 



 - 9-



$0.2 million during the three months ended April 1, 2018 related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods.
Accrued rebates and accrued returns as of April 1, 2018 totaled $17.9 million and $6.9 million, respectively.
Estimated price adjustments recognized against our gross accounts receivable balance as of April 1, 2018 totaled $25.7 million.
Depending on the terms of an arrangement, we may defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received because we have to satisfy a future obligation.
Consideration allocated to support services under a support and maintenance contract is typically paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the service.
Consideration allocated to professional services is recognized when or as the services are performed depending on the terms of the arrangement.
As of January 1, 2018, total deferred revenue was $104.4 million, and $52.0 million of this amount was recognized as revenue during the three months ended April 1, 2018.
Total deferred revenue was $97.8 million as of April 1, 2018.
Total capitalized sales commissions was $2.4 million as of April 1, 2018.
Total sales commissions costs were $6.1 million during the three months ended April 1, 2018.
Sales commissions are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.
Note 3: Acquisitions



Snell Advanced Media



We acquired 100% of the outstanding ownership interest in Snell Advanced Media (SAM) on February 8, 2018 for a purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $92.9 million.
The acquisition includes a potential earnout, which is based upon future earnings of SAM and Grass Valley combined through December 31, 2019.
The maximum earnout consideration is $31.4 million, but based upon a third party valuation specialist using certain assumptions in a discounted cash flow model, the preliminary estimated fair value of the earnout included in the purchase price is $17.7 million.
We assumed debt of $19.3 million and paid it off during the first quarter of 2018.
SAM designs, manufactures, and sells innovative content production and distribution systems for the broadcast and media markets.
SAM is located in the United Kingdom.
The following table summarizes the estimated, preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as of February 8, 2018 (in thousands):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The above purchase price allocation is preliminary, and is subject to revision as additional information about the fair value of individual assets and liabilities becomes available.
We are in the process of ensuring our accounting policies are applied at SAM.
The preliminary measurement of receivables; inventories; property, plant and equipment; intangible assets; goodwill; deferred 



 - 10-



income taxes; deferred revenue; and other assets and liabilities are subject to change.
A change in the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill.
The preliminary fair value of acquired receivables is $19.9 million, which is equivalent to its gross contractual amount.
For purposes of the above allocation, we based our estimate of the preliminary fair value for the acquired inventory; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and deferred revenue on a preliminary valuation study performed by a third party valuation firm.
To determine the value of the acquired property, plant, and equipment, we used various valuation methods, including both the market approach, which considers sales prices of similar assets in similar conditions (Level 2 valuation), and the cost approach, which considers the cost to replace the asset adjusted for depreciation (Level 3 valuation).
We used various valuation methods including discounted cash flows, lost income, excess earnings, and relief from royalty to estimate the preliminary fair value of the identifiable intangible assets and deferred revenue (Level 3 valuation).
Goodwill and other intangible assets reflected above were determined to meet the criteria for recognition apart from tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies and the assembled workforce.
The expected synergies for the SAM acquisition may be gained from helping broadcast and media content creators, aggregators and distributors significantly improve their effectiveness and efficiency during a period of rapid change in technology, viewer and advertiser behavior and busines models.
The intangible assets related to the acquisition consisted of the following:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The amortizable intangible assets reflected in the table above were determined by us to have finite lives.
The useful life for the customer relationship intangible asset was based on our forecasts of estimated sales from recurring customers.
The useful life of the backlog intangible asset was based on our estimate of when the ordered items would ship.
The useful life for the trademarks was based on the period of time we expect to continue to go to market using the trademarks.
Our consolidated revenues and consolidated income before taxes for the three months ended April 1, 2018 included $20.8 million and $(2.8) million, respectively, from SAM.
The loss before taxes from SAM included $2.2 million of amortization of intangible assets and $0.5 million of cost of sales related to the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value.
- 11-



The following table illustrates the unaudited pro forma effect on operating results as if the SAM acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2017.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For purposes of the pro forma disclosures, the three months ended April 2, 2017 includes nonrecurring expenses related to the acquisition, including severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; amortization of the sales backlog intangible asset; and cost of sales arising from the adjustment of inventory to fair value of $9.2 million, $1.3 million, and $0.8 million, respectively.
Pro forma adjustments exclude cost savings from any synergies resulting from the acquisition.
Thinklogical Holdings, LLC



We acquired 100% of the outstanding ownership interest in Thinklogical Holdings, LLC (Thinklogical) on May 31, 2017 for a purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $165.8 million.
Thinklogical designs, manufactures, and markets high-bandwidth fiber matrix switches, video, and keyboard/video/mouse extender solutions, camera extenders, and console management solutions.
Thinklogical is headquartered in Connecticut.
The preliminary fair value of acquired receivables is $4.4 million, which is equivalent to its gross contractual amount.
For purposes of the above allocation, we based our estimate of the preliminary fair value for the acquired inventory, intangible assets, and deferred revenue on a preliminary valuation study performed by a third party valuation firm.
We used various valuation methods including discounted cash flows, lost income, 



 - 12-



excess earnings, and relief from royalty to estimate the preliminary fair value of the identifiable intangible assets and deferred revenue (Level 3 valuation).
The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the allocation of the purchase price is substantially complete pending the completion of a stub period tax return that has yet to be filed.
Goodwill and other intangible assets reflected above were determined to meet the criteria for recognition apart from tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies and the assembled workforce.
The expected synergies for the Thinklogical acquisition primarily consist of utilizing Belden's fiber and connectivity portfolio with Thinklogical's connections between matrix switch, control systems, transmitters and source to expand our product portfolio across our segments to both existing and new customers.
The intangible assets related to the acquisition consisted of the following:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The amortizable intangible assets reflected in the table above were determined by us to have finite lives.
The useful life for the customer relationship intangible asset was based on our forecasts of estimated sales from recurring customers.
The useful life for the trademarks was based on the period of time we expect to continue to go to market using the trademarks.
The useful life of the backlog intangible asset was based on our estimate of when the ordered items would ship.
The loss before taxes from Thinklogical included $3.2 million of amortization of intangible assets.
The following table illustrates the unaudited pro forma effect on operating results as if the Thinklogical acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2016.
Pro forma adjustments exclude cost savings from any synergies resulting from the acquisition.
Note 4: Disposals



During the fourth quarter of 2016, we committed to a plan to sell our MCS business and Hirschmann JV.
The MCS business operated in Germany and the United States and was part of the Industrial Solutions segment, and the Hirschmann JV was an equity method investment located in China.
Effective December 31, 2017, we sold the MCS business and Hirschmann JV for a total purchase price of $40.2 million, of which $39.1 million was collected during the first quarter of 2018.
Note 5: Operating Segments



We are organized around two global business platforms: Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions.
Each of the global business platforms represents a reportable segment.
Effective January 1, 2018, we changed our organizational structure and, as a result, now are reporting two segments.
The segments formerly known as Broadcast Solutions and Enterprise Solutions now are presented as the Enterprise Solutions segment, and the segments formerly known as Industrial Solutions and Network Solutions now are presented as the Industrial Solutions segment.
The reorganization allows us to further accelerate progress in key strategic areas and the segment consolidation properly aligns our external reporting with the way the businesses are now managed.
We have recast the prior period segment information to conform to the change in the composition of these reportable segments.
This change had no impact to our reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.
The key measures of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker are Segment Revenues and Segment EBITDA.
Segment EBITDA excludes certain items, including depreciation expense; amortization of intangibles; asset impairment; severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; purchase accounting effects related to acquisitions, such as the adjustment of acquired inventory and deferred revenue to fair value; and other costs.
We allocate corporate expenses to the segments for purposes of measuring Segment EBITDA.
Corporate expenses are allocated on the basis of each segment’s relative EBITDA prior to the allocation.
Our measure of segment assets does not include cash, goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets, or corporate assets.
All goodwill is allocated to reporting units of our segments for purposes of impairment testing.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 - 15-



(1) For the three months ended April 1, 2018, our segment results include revenues that would have been recorded by acquired businesses had they remained as independent entities.
(2) See Note 9, Severance, Restructuring, and Acquisition Integration Activities, for details.
(3) For the three months ended ended April 1, 2018, we recognized cost of sales for the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value related to the SAM acquisition.
Note 6: Income per Share



The following table presents the basis for the income per share computations:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include outstanding equity awards of 0.5 million and 0.3 million, respectively, because to do so would have been anti-dilutive.
In addition, for the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include outstanding equity awards of 0.2 million and 0.2 million, respectively, because the related performance conditions have not been satisfied.
Furthermore, for both the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include the impact of preferred shares that are convertible into 6.9 million common shares, because deducting the preferred stock dividends from net income was more dilutive.
For purposes of calculating basic earnings per share, unvested restricted stock units are not included in the calculation of basic weighted average shares outstanding until all necessary conditions have been satisfied and issuance of the shares underlying the restricted stock units is no longer contingent.
For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, unvested restricted stock units are included to the extent that they are dilutive.
In determining whether unvested restricted stock units are dilutive, each issuance of restricted stock units is considered separately.
Once a restricted stock unit has vested, it is included in the calculation of both basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
Note 7: Inventories



The major classes of inventories were as follows:



 - 16-



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Note 8: Long-Lived Assets



Depreciation and Amortization Expense



We recognized depreciation expense of $11.9 million and $11.4 million in the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, respectively.
We recognized amortization expense related to our intangible assets of $24.6 million and $23.7 million in the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, respectively.
Note 9: Severance, Restructuring, and Acquisition Integration Activities



Grass Valley and SAM Integration Program: 2018



During the first quarter of 2018, we began a restructuring program to integrate our acquisition of SAM with Grass Valley.
The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired operating facilities and other support functions.
We recognized $9.2 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three months ended April 1, 2018.
The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment.
We expect to incur approximately $41 million of additional severance and restructuring costs for this program, most of which will be incurred by the end of 2018.
We also expect the program to generate approximately $44 million of savings on an annualized basis, which we will start realizing in the second half of 2018.
Industrial Manufacturing Footprint Program: 2016 - 2018



In 2016, we began a program to consolidate our manufacturing footprint.
The manufacturing consolidation is expected to be completed in 2018.
We recognized $7.5 million and $5.7 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, respectively.
To date, we have incurred a total of $55.9 million in severance and other restructuring costs, including manufacturing inefficiencies for this program.
We expect the program to generate approximately $13 million of savings on an annualized basis, which we began to realize in the third quarter of 2017.
The following table summarizes the costs by segment of the various programs described above as well as other immaterial programs and acquisition integration activities:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 - 17-



Of the total severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs recognized in the three months ended April 1, 2018, $9.4 million, $9.4 million, and $1.6 million were included in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses; and research and development, respectively.
Of the total severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs recognized in the three months ended April 2, 2017, $5.9 million, $0.7 million, and $0.0 million were included in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses; and research and development, respectively.
The majority of the other restructuring and integration costs related to these actions were paid as incurred or are payable within the next 60 days.
There were no significant severance accrual balances as of April 1, 2018 or December 31, 2017.
Note 10: Long-Term Debt and Other Borrowing Arrangements



The carrying values of our long-term debt were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Revolving Credit Agreement due 2022



Our Revolving Credit Agreement provides a $400.0 million multi-currency asset-based revolving credit facility (The Revolver).
The borrowing base under the Revolver includes eligible accounts receivable; inventory; and property, plant and equipment of certain of our subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada, Germany, and the Netherlands.
The maturity date of the Revolver is May 16, 2022.
Interest on outstanding borrowings is variable, based upon LIBOR or other similar indices in foreign jurisdictions, plus a spread that ranges from 1.25%-1.75%, depending upon our leverage position.
In the event we borrow more than 90% of our borrowing base, we are subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant.
As of April 1, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding on the Revolver, and our available borrowing capacity was $333.4 million.
Senior Subordinated Notes



In March 2018, we completed an offering for €350.0 million ($431.3 million at issuance) aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior subordinated notes due 2028 (the 2028 Notes).
The carrying value of the 2028 Notes as of April 1, 2018 is $432.3 million.
The 2028 Notes rank equal in right of payment with our senior subordinated notes due 2027, 2026, 2025, 2024, and 2023 and with any future subordinated debt, and they are subordinated to all of our senior debt and the senior debt of our subsidiary guarantors, including our Revolver.
Interest is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2018.
We paid approximately $7.1 million of fees associated with the issuance of the 2028 Notes, which will be amortized over the life of the 2028 Notes using the effective interest method.
We used the net proceeds from this offering and cash on hand to repurchase the 2023 and 2024 Notes - see further discussion below.
We have outstanding €450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior subordinated notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes).
The carrying value of the 2027 Notes as of April 1, 2018 is $555.8 million.

Note 11: Net Investment Hedge



All of our euro denominated notes were issued by Belden Inc., a USD functional currency ledger.
The objective of the hedge is to protect the net investment in the foreign operation against adverse changes in exchange rates.
The transaction gain or loss is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income.
The amount of the cumulative translation adjustment associated with these notes at April 1, 2018 was $39.2 million.
As of April 2, 2017, only our 2026 Notes were designated as a net investment hedge on the foreign currency risk of our net investment in our euro foreign operations, and the cumulative translation adjustment associated with the 2026 Notes at April 2, 2017 was $6.9 million.

On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
During the three months ended April 1, 2018, we obtained additional information affecting the provisional amount initially recorded for the valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credits in 2017.
We continue to evaluate the need for a provisional amount regarding the non-deductibility of certain covered employee compensation associated with the amendments to IRC section 162(m).
As of the date of this filing, we reasonably believe no such provision should be recorded.
Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete.

Note 15: Preferred Stock



In 2016, we issued 5.2 million depositary shares, each of which represents 1/100th interest in a share of 6.75% Series B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock), for an offering price of $100 per depositary share.
Holders of the Preferred Stock may elect to convert their shares into common stock at any time prior to the mandatory conversion date.
Unless earlier 



 - 21-



converted, each share of Preferred Stock will automatically convert into common stock on or around July 15, 2019 into between 120.46 and 132.50 shares of Belden common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.
This represents a range of 6.2 million to 6.9 million shares of Belden common stock to be issued upon conversion.
The number of shares of Belden common stock issuable upon the mandatory conversion of the Preferred Stock will be determined based upon the volume-weighted average price of Belden’s common stock over the 20 day trading period beginning on, and including, the 22nd scheduled trading day prior to July 15, 2019.
The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $501 million.
With respect to dividend and liquidation rights, the Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock and junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness.
During each of the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, the Preferred Stock accrued $8.7 million of dividends.
Note 16: Share Repurchases



On May 25, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program, which allows us to purchase up to $200.0 million of our common stock through open market repurchases, negotiated transactions, or other means, in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions.
This program is funded with cash on hand and cash flows from operating activities.
The program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended at any time at the discretion of the Company.
Note 17: Subsequent Events



On March 27, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the redemption of all outstanding preferred share purchase rights issued pursuant to the then existing Rights Agreement (commonly known as a “poison pill”).
Under the former Rights Agreement, one right was attached to each outstanding share of common stock.
The rights were redeemed at a redemption price of $0.01 per right, payable in cash.
The redemption payment was made on April 6, 2018 to the holders of the rights as of the close of business on March 27, 2018.
We accrued approximately $0.4 million for the redemption of the Rights Agreement as of April 1, 2018.
On April 5, 2018, we repurchased the remaining €56.9 million of the €200.0 million 2023 Notes outstanding as well as $11.3 million of the $200.0 million 2024 Notes outstanding, and we expect to recognize a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $3.0 million in the second quarter.

Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations



Overview



Belden Inc. (the Company, us, we, or our) is a signal transmission solutions company built around two global business platforms – Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions.
Our comprehensive portfolio of signal transmission solutions provides industry leading secure and reliable transmission of data, sound, and video for mission critical applications.
We strive for operational excellence through the execution of our Belden Business System, which includes three areas of focus: Lean enterprise initiatives, our Market Delivery System, and our Talent Management System.
Through operational excellence we generate free cash flow on an annual basis.
We utilize the cash flow generated by our business to fuel our continued transformation and generate shareholder value.
We believe our business system, balance across markets and geographies, systematic go-to-market approach, extensive portfolio of innovative solutions, commitment to Lean principles, and improving margins present a unique value proposition for shareholders.
We consider revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flows, and return on invested capital to be our key operating performance indicators.
We also seek to acquire businesses that we believe can help us achieve these objectives.
Foreign currency



Our exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relates to exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, British pound, and Brazilian real.
During the three months ended April 1, 2018, approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues were to customers outside of the U.S.
As such, all references to the effect of channel inventory changes are estimates.
Our strategic goal is to utilize our Market Delivery System to target faster growing geographies, applications, and trends within our end markets, in order to achieve growth that is higher than the general market growth rate.
To the extent that we exceed the market growth rates, we consider it to be the result of capturing market share.
Operating Segments



Effective January 1, 2018, we changed our organizational structure and, as a result, now are reporting two segments.
The segments formerly known as Broadcast Solutions and Enterprise Solutions now are presented as the Enterprise Solutions segment, and the segments formerly known as Industrial Solutions and Network Solutions now are presented as the Industrial Solutions segment.
The reorganization allows us to further accelerate progress in key strategic areas and the segment consolidation properly aligns our external reporting with the way the businesses are now managed.
We have recast the prior period segment information to conform to the change in the composition of these reportable segments.
Acquisitions



We completed the acquisition of Snell Advanced Media (SAM) on February 8, 2018.
See Note 3.
Long-term Debt



In March 2018, we issued €350.0 million ($431.3 million at issuance) aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2028 at an interest rate of 3.875%.
We used the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase $188.7 million of our outstanding $200.0 million 5.25% senior subordinated notes due 2024 and €143.1 million of our outstanding €200.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023.
We paid approximately $7.1 million of fees related to issuing the 2028 notes, and recognized a $20.0 million loss on debt extinguishment for premiums paid to the bond holders to retire the 2024 and 2023 notes and for the unamortized debt issuance costs that we wrote-off.
See Note 10.
Grass Valley and SAM Integration Program



During the first quarter of 2018, we began a restructuring program to integrate our acquisition of SAM with Grass Valley.
The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired operating facilities and other support functions.
We recognized $9.2 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three months ended April 1, 2018.
The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment.
We expect to incur approximately $41 million of additional severance and restructuring costs for this program, most of which will be incurred by the end of 2018.
We also expect the program to generate approximately $44 million of savings on an annualized basis, which we will start realizing in the second half of 2018.
The manufacturing consolidation will be completed this year.
We recognized $7.5 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three months ended April 1, 2018.
We expect the program to generate approximately $13 million of savings on an annualized basis, which we began to realize in the third quarter of 2017.
Results of Operations



Consolidated Income before Taxes



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Revenues increased $54.2 million, or 9.8%, in the three months ended April 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017 due to the following factors:



•The acquisitions of SAM and Thinklogical contributed $28.6 million to the increase in revenues.
•Favorable currency translation resulted in a revenue increase of $17.9 million.
•Higher copper costs contributed $7.5 million to the increase in revenues.
•Higher sales volume resulted in a $6.2 million increase in revenues.
•The divestiture of our MCS business resulted in a revenue decrease of $6.0 million.
Gross profit increased $8.2 million, or 3.7%, in the three months ended April 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017 due to the increases in revenues discussed above, partially offset by increases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; cost of sales for the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value for the SAM acquisition; and amortization of software developments costs during 2018 of $3.5 million, $0.5 million, and $0.2 million, respectively.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $12.3 million in the three months ended April 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017.
Acquisitions contributed $10.0 million to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses year-over-year.
Increases in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs, excluding the impact of acquisitions contributed $2.6 million to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses year-over-year.
These increases were partially offset by improved productivity.
Research and development expenses increased $2.6 million in the three months ended April 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017.
Acquisitions contributed $3.6 million to the increase over the year ago period, partially offset by $0.6 million for the impact of the MCS divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2017.
- 25-



Amortization of intangibles increased $0.7 million in the three months ended April 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017.
This is primarily due to the acquisitions of SAM and Thinklogical, which contributed $5.4 million to the increase over the year ago period.
The impact of acquisitions was partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during 2017.
Operating income decreased $7.4 million in the three months ended April 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017 primarily due to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development, partially offset by the increase in gross profit discussed above.
Net interest expense decreased $6.5 million, or 27.8%, in the three months ended April 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017 as a result of our debt transactions during 2017 and 2018.
In July 2017, we issued €450.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2027 at an interest rate of 3.375%.
We used the net proceeds of this offering and cash on hand to repurchase all of our outstanding $700.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2022.
In September 2017, we issued €300.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2025 at an interest rate of 2.875%.
We used the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase €300.0 million of our outstanding €500.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023.
In March 2018, we issued €350.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2028 at an interest rate of 3.875%.
We used the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase $188.7 million of our outstanding $200.0 million 5.25% senior subordinated notes due 2024 and €143.1 million of our outstanding €200.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023.
See Note 10.
The loss on debt extinguishment recognized in the first quarter of 2018 represents the premium paid to the bond holders to retire a portion of the 2023 and 2024 notes and the unamortized debt issuance costs written-off.
See Note 10.
Income before taxes decreased $20.8 million in the three months ended April 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017.
This decrease is due to the loss on debt extinguishment and decrease in operating income, partially offset by lower interest expense discussed above.
Income Taxes



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We recognized income tax expense of $4.4 million for the three months ended April 1, 2018, representing an effective tax rate of 63.2%.
The amount of this adjustment remains provisional under SAB 118.
On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
During the three months ended April 1, 2018, we obtained additional information affecting the provisional amount initially recorded for the valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credits in 2017.
We continue to evaluate the need for a provisional amount regarding the non-deductibility of certain covered employee compensation associated with the amendments to IRC section 162(m).
As of the date of this filing, we reasonably believe no such provision should be recorded.
Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to tax expense in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete.
Consolidated Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Adjusted Revenues increased $56.0 million, or 10.2%, in the three months ended April 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017 due to the following factors:



•



•The acquisitions of SAM and Thinklogical contributed $30.4 million to the increase in revenues.
•Favorable currency translation resulted in a revenue increase of $17.9 million.
•Higher copper costs contributed $7.5 million to the increase in revenues.
•Higher sales volume resulted in a $6.2 million increase in revenues.
•The divestiture of our MCS business resulted in a revenue decrease of $6.0 million.
Adjusted EBITDA increased $10.3 million, or 11.1%, in the three months ended April 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017 primarily due to the increases in revenues discussed above, partially offset by unfavorable product mix.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information



Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures.
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we provide non-GAAP operating results adjusted for certain items, including: asset impairments; accelerated depreciation expense due to plant consolidation activities; purchase accounting effects related to acquisitions, such as the adjustment of acquired inventory and deferred revenue to fair value, and transaction costs; severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; gains (losses) recognized on the disposal of businesses and tangible assets; amortization of intangible assets; gains (losses) on debt extinguishment; certain revenues and gains (losses) from patent settlements; discontinued operations; and other costs.
We adjust for the items listed above in all periods presented, unless the impact is clearly immaterial to our financial statements.
We believe this presentation is useful in evaluating the underlying performance of acquired companies.
We believe the adjusted measures, accompanied by the disclosure of the costs of these programs, provides valuable insight.
Adjusted results should be considered only in conjunction with results reported according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
(2) See Note 9, Severance, Restructuring, and Acquisition Integration Activities, for details.
(3) For the three months ended April 1, 2018, we recognized cost of sales for the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value related to the SAM acquisition.

Enterprise Solutions



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Enterprise Solutions revenues increased $36.7 million, or 11.7%, in the three months ended April 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017.
Acquisitions, favorable currency translation, and rising copper prices contributed $30.5 million, $8.0 million, and $3.5 million to the increase in revenues, respectively.
The increases above were partially offset by decreases in volume of $5.3 million.
The decreases in volume were experienced in our live media production market.
- 28-



Enterprise Solutions EBITDA increased $7.9 million, or 16.0%, in the three months ended April 1, 2018 compared to the year ago period driven by the revenue growth discussed above and sustainable productivity initiatives.
Accordingly, EBTIDA margins expanded 60 basis points over the year ago period.
Industrial Solutions



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Industrial Solutions revenues increased $19.3 million, or 8.2%, in the three months ended April 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017.
Increases in volume, favorable currency translation, and rising copper prices contributed $11.4 million, $9.9 million, and $4.0 million to the increase in revenues, respectively.

Industrial Solutions EBITDA increased $2.6 million, or 5.9%, in the three months ended April 1, 2018 from the comparable period of 2017 due to the growth in revenues discussed above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources



Significant factors affecting our cash liquidity include (1) cash from operating activities, (2) disposals of businesses and tangible assets, (3) cash used for acquisitions, restructuring actions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, and senior subordinated note repurchases, (4) our available credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements, and (5) cash proceeds from equity offerings.
The following table is derived from our Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow Statements:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Operating cash flows were a use of cash of $83.9 million and $12.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing a decrease of $71.6 million.
The decrease in operating cash flow as compared to prior year is primarily due to an unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities of $69.2 million.
While the days payable outstanding of 92 days as of the 



 - 29-



end of the first quarter of 2018 was consistent with the first quarter of 2017, accounts payable at the end of 2017 included approximately $16.0 million for growth capital expenditure projects and $30 million related to the build in safety stock inventory during the fourth quarter in support of the closure of the Monticello facility.
The unfavorable change in operating cash flow during the first quarter of 2018 includes the payments for these fourth quarter 2017 actions.
Net cash used for investing activities totaled $52.9 million for the three months ended April 1, 2018, compared to $10.4 million for the comparable period of 2017.

The table presents principal amounts by expected maturity dates and fair values as of April 1, 2018.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) We repurchased the remaining 2024 and 2023 Notes outstanding on April 5, 2018.
See Note 10.

There were no material changes in our exposure to market risks since December 31, 2017.
Item 4: Controls and Procedures



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, for the three month period ended April 1, 2018.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, because of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described in our 2017 Form 10-K as filed on February 13, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of April 1, 2018.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
We are executing our remediation plan as described fully in our 2017 Form 10-K.
In response to the identified material weakness, our management, with oversight from our audit committee, has dedicated resources to improve our control environment and to remedy the identified material weakness.
We believe that we have designed the appropriate controls to remediate the material weakness and began executing the controls during the three months ended April 1, 2018.
These controls include additional procedures related to the review of material contracts.
However, the Company is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new processes for a sufficient period of time.
Therefore, until all remedial actions, including the efforts to test the control activities, are fully completed, the material weakness identified 



 - 31-



will continue to exist.
We are committed to achieving and maintaining a strong control environment, high ethical standards, and financial reporting integrity and transparency.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



As described above, we have designed and implemented additional controls in connection with our remediation plan.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION



Item 1: Legal Proceedings



PPC Broadband, Inc. v. Corning Optical Communications RF, LLC - On July 5, 2011, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, PPC Broadband, Inc. (“PPC”), filed an action for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York against Corning Optical Communications RF LLC (“Corning”).
6,558,194 and 6,848,940 - each entitled “Connector and Method of Operation.” In July 2015, a jury found that Corning willfully infringed both patents.
In November 2016, following a series of post-trial motions, the trial judge issued rulings for a total judgment in our favor of approximately $61.3 million.
In December 2016, Corning appealed the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
In March 2018, a panel of three judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a Rule 36 Affirmance, without written opinion, of the District Court's final judgment that Corning, among other things, willfully infringed the PPC universal compression patents at issue in the case, and that PPC should be awarded about $61.8 million as a result.
On April 12, 2018, Corning filed a petition for re-hearing.
We have not recorded any amounts in our consolidated financial statements related to this matter.
We are also a party to various legal proceedings and administrative actions that are incidental to our operations.
This program is funded with cash on hand and cash flows from operating activities.
The program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended at any time at the discretion of the Company.
From inception of the program to April 1, 2018, we have repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock under the program for an aggregate cost of $100.3 million and an average price of $73.53.
