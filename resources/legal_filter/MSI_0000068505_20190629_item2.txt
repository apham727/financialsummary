Our Business



We are a leading global provider of mission-critical communications.
Our technology platforms in communications, software, video security, and services make cities safer and help communities and businesses thrive.
We conduct our business globally and manage it by two segments:



Products and Systems Integration: The Products and Systems Integration segment offers an extensive portfolio of infrastructure, devices, accessories, video security solutions, and the implementation, optimization, and integration of such systems, devices, and applications, including the Company’s: (i) “ASTRO” products, which meet the Association of Public Safety Communications Officials Project 25 standard, (ii) “Dimetra” products which meet the European Telecommunications Standards Institute Terrestrial Trunked Radio “TETRA” standard, (iii) Professional and Commercial Radio (“PCR”) products, (iv) broadband technology products, such as Long-Term Evolution (“LTE”), and (v) video security solutions, such as video cameras.
The primary customers of the Products and Systems Integration segment are government, public safety and first-responder agencies, municipalities, and commercial and industrial customers who operate private communications networks and video security solutions typically managing a mobile workforce.
In the second quarter of 2019, the segment’s net sales were $1.2 billion, representing 67% of our consolidated net sales.
Services and Software: The Services and Software segment provides a broad range of solution offerings for government, public safety and commercial communication networks.
Services includes a continuum of service offerings beginning with repair, technical support and maintenance.
More advanced offerings include monitoring, software updates and cybersecurity services.
Managed services range from partial to full operation of customer or Motorola Solutions-owned networks.
Software includes a public safety and enterprise command center software suite, unified communications applications, and video software solutions, delivered both on premise and “as a service.” In the second quarter of 2019, the segment’s net sales were $622 million, representing 33% of our consolidated net sales.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The proceeds of our receivable sales are included in "Operating activities" within our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Debt



We had outstanding long-term debt of $5.3 billion, including the current portions of $28 million and $31 million at June 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
In February of 2018, we issued $500 million of 4.60% Senior notes due 2028.

These proceeds were then used to make a $500 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan in the first quarter of 2018.
During the second half of 2018, we issued an additional $200 million on the outstanding notes.
We recognized net proceeds of $196 million after debt issuance costs and debt discounts.
To complete the acquisition of Avigilon during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we entered into a term loan for $400 million with a maturity date of March 26, 2021 (the "Term Loan").
Interest on the Term Loan is variable, indexed to London Inter-bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), and paid monthly.
The weighted average borrowing rate for amounts outstanding during the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 was 3.72% and 3.74%, respectively.
No additional borrowings are permitted and amounts borrowed and repaid or prepaid may not be re-borrowed.

As of June 29, 2019, we had $800 million of 2.0% Senior Convertible Notes outstanding with Silver Lake Partners which mature in September 2020 and are fully convertible.
The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 14.8968, as may be adjusted for dividends declared, per $1,000 principal amount (which is currently equal to a published conversion price of $67.13 per share).
We intend to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash.
Credit Facilities



As of June 29, 2019, we had a $2.2 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in April 2022 (the "2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement").
The 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a $500 million letter of credit sub-limit with $450 million of fronting commitments.
Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above LIBOR, at our option.
An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line.
The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if our credit rating changes.
We must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement.
During the first quarter of 2018, we borrowed $400 million to facilitate the Avigilon acquisition.
There were no borrowings outstanding or letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility as of June 29, 2019.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements.
This was subsequently amended by ASU No.
2018-01, “Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842,” ASU No.
2018-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases,” and ASU No.
2018-11, “Targeted Improvements” (collectively "ASC 842").
ASC 842 establishes a right-of-use model ("ROU") that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with an initial term longer than twelve months.
We adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective transition approach for all leases existing at January 1, 2019, the date of the initial application.
Consequently, financial information will not be updated and disclosures required under ASC 842 will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019.
ASC 842 provides for a number of optional practical expedients in transition.
We elected the practical expedients, which permit us to not reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs under ASC 842.
We did not elect the "use-of hindsight" practical expedient to determine the lease term or in assessing the likelihood that a lease purchase option will be exercised, allowing us to carry forward the lease term as determined prior to adoption of ASC 842.
ASC 842 also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting.
For those leases that qualify, the exemption allows us to not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, including not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases at transition.
Short-term lease costs are recognized as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term consistent with our prior accounting.
We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all current lease categories.
As of January 1, 2019, we recognized operating lease liabilities of $648 million based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments determined under prior lease accounting standards and corresponding ROU assets of $588 million.
The $60 million difference between operating lease liabilities and ROU assets recognized is due to deferred rent and exit cost accruals recorded under prior lease accounting standards.
ASC 842 requires such balances to be reclassified against ROU assets at transition.
ASC 842 provides a practical expedient for lessors in which the lessor may elect, by class of underlying asset, to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component and, instead, to account for these components as a single component if both of the following are met: (i) the timing and pattern of transfer of the non-lease component(s) and associated lease component are the same and (ii) the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease.
The accounting under the practical expedient depends on which component(s) is predominant in the contract.
If the non-lease component is predominant, the single component is accounted under ASC Topic 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" and accounting and disclosure under ASC 842 is not applicable.
We have elected the above practical expedient and determined that non-lease components are predominant and is accounting for the single components as managed service contracts under ASC Topic 606.
