  Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 
  Earnings Per Share (EPS) 
 Earnings per share guidance requires that basic net income per common share be computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing the net income for the period by the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units totaling 110,000 and 1,000 were excluded in the computation of diluted earnings per common share during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, because their impact was anti-dilutive. 
  Revenue Recognition 
 Substantially all of the Company’s revenue comes from contracts with customers for subscriptions to its cloud-based products or contracts to perform compliance or other services. Customers consist primarily of corporate issuers and professional firms, such as investor relations and public relations firms. In the case of our news distribution and webcasting offerings, our customers also include private companies. The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is an enforceable contract between the Company and the customer, the rights of the parties are identified, the contract has economic substance, and collectability of the contract consideration is probable. The Company's revenues are measured based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer. 
 The Company recognizes revenue for subscriptions evenly over the contract period, upon distribution for per release contracts and upon event completion for webcasting events. For service contracts that include stand ready obligations, revenue is recognized evenly over the contract period. For all other services delivered on a per project or event basis, the revenue is recognized at the completion of the event. The Company believes recognizing revenue for subscriptions and stand ready obligations using a time-based measure of progress, best reflects the Company’s performance in satisfying the obligations. 
 For bundled contracts, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the subscription or services. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company uses the residual method to allocate any remaining costs to that subscription or service. The Company regularly reviews standalone selling prices and updates these estimates if necessary. 
 The Company invoices its customers based on the billing schedules designated in its contracts, typically upfront on either a monthly, quarterly or annual basis or per transaction at the completion of the performance obligation. Deferred revenue for the periods presented was primarily related to subscription and service contracts, which are billed upfront, quarterly or annually, however the revenue has not yet been recognized. The associated deferred revenue is generally recognized ratably over the billing period. Deferred revenue as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $1,464,000 and $1,249,000, respectively, and is expected to be recognized within one year. Revenue recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of each reporting period, was approximately $690,000 and $488,000, respectively. Accounts receivable related to contracts with customers was $2,237,000 and $1,593,000 as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Since substantially all of the contracts have terms of one year or less, the Company has elected to use the practical expedient regarding the existence of a significant financing. 
  Use of Estimates 
  Capitalized Software 
 Costs incurred to develop our cloud-based platform products are capitalized when the preliminary project phase is complete, management commits to fund the project and it is probable the project will be completed and used for its intended purposes. Once the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, the software is amortized over its estimated useful life. Costs related to design or maintenance of the software are expensed as incurred. No costs were capitalized during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company recorded amortization expense of $204,000 and $201,000 during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. All of the amortization is included in Cost of revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income, with the exception of $4,000 and $2,000, which is included in Depreciation and amortization for each of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as it relates to back-office supporting systems. 
 We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our operating lease agreements are primarily for office space and are included within operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Our variable lease payments consist of non-lease services related to the lease. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Rental expense for lease payments related to operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Level 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the reporting date. Generally, this includes debt and equity securities that are traded in an active market. Our cash and cash equivalents are quoted at Level 1.   
Level 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Generally, this includes debt and equity securities that are not traded in an active market.   
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or other valuation techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.   
 As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we believe that the fair value of our financial instruments other than cash and cash equivalents, such as, accounts receivable, our line of credit, notes payable, and accounts payable approximate their carrying amounts. 
  Translation of Foreign Financial Statements 
  Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 We account for business combinations under FASB ASC No. 805 – Business Combinations and the related acquired intangible assets and goodwill under FASB ASC No. 350 – Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. The authoritative guidance for business combinations specifies the criteria for recognizing and reporting intangible assets apart from goodwill. We record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Intangible assets consist of client relationships, customer lists, distribution partner relationships, software, technology, non-compete agreements and trademarks that are initially measured at fair value. At the time of the business combination, trademarks are considered an indefinite-lived asset and, as such, are not amortized as there is no foreseeable limit to cash flows generated from them. The goodwill and intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment, or whenever conditions indicate the asset may be impaired, and any such impairment will be recognized in the period identified. The client relationships (7-10 years), customer lists (3 years), distribution partner relationships (10 years), non-compete agreements (5 years) and software and technology (3-6 years) are amortized over their estimated useful lives. 
  Comprehensive Income 
  Advertising 
  Stock-based compensation 
 We account for stock-based compensation under FASB ASC No. 718 – Compensation – Stock Compensation. The authoritative guidance for stock compensation requires that companies estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of the grant using an option-pricing model. The associated cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. 
  Recently adopted accounting pronouncements 
 In February 2016, the FASB established Topic 842, Leases, by issuing Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842; ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases; and ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements. The new standard establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement. 
  Acquisition of the VisualWebcaster Platform (“VWP”) 
 On January 3, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “VWP Agreement”) with Onstream Media Corporation, a Florida corporation (the “Seller”), whereby the Company purchased certain assets related primarily to customer accounts, intellectual property, lease deposits and assumed certain existing contractual obligations related primarily to data processing and storage, bandwidth and facility leases relating to the Seller’s VisualWebcaster Platform ("VWP”). The accounts receivable and the accounts payable related VWP and existing as of the Closing Date were not included as part of the VWP Agreement. 
 The transaction consisted of a single cash payment to the Seller in the amount of $2,788,000. In connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed two short-term leases associated with an office and co-location for certain computer equipment in New York City, New York as well as entered into a three-year office lease in Florida. In addition to the intangible assets listed below, the purchase price included lease deposits of $13,000 and a right of use asset and corresponding lease liability for the office lease in Florida in the amount of $125,000. 
  Select Pro-Forma Financial Information (Unaudited) 
  Acquisition of Filing Services Canada Inc. (“FSCwire”) 
 On July 3, 2018, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “FSCwire Agreement”) with the sole shareholder of FSCwire, a company incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta), whereby the Company purchased all of the outstanding equity securities of FSCwire. Under the terms of the FSCwire Agreement, the Company paid $1,140,000 at closing ($180,000 of which was paid into an escrow account to cover standard representations and warranties included within the FSCwire Agreement) and issued 3,402 shares of restricted common stock of the Company.  
 The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, which requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs, which totaled approximately $52,000, are not included as a component of the acquisition accounting, but are recognized as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred. Any changes within the measurement period resulting from facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date may result in retrospective adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded at the acquisition date. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company employed a third party valuation firm to assist in determining the purchase price allocation of assets and liabilities acquired from FSCwire. The valuation resulted in the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities disclosed below. The income approach was used to determine the value of FSCwire’s customer relationships and the relief from royalty method was used to value the distribution partner relationships. 
 The Company has elected not to provide unaudited pro forma financial information for the FSCwire acquisition, because the acquisition was not considered a significant acquisition in accordance with Rule 3-05 of the SEC's Regulation S-X. 
  2014 Equity Incentive Plan 
 On May 23, 2014, the shareholders of the Company approved the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”). Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, the Company is authorized to issue incentive awards for common stock up to 200,000 shares to employees and other personnel. On June 10, 2016, the shareholders of the Company approved an additional 200,000 awards to be issued under the 2014 Plan, bringing the total number of shares to be awarded to 400,000. The awards may be in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance awards. The 2014 Plan is effective through March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2019, there are 47,000 shares which remain to be granted under the 2014 Plan. 
 As of March 31, 2019, the Company had unrecognized stock compensation related to the options of $189,000, which will be recognized through 2021. 
 During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company granted 22,000 restricted stock units with an intrinsic value of $11.90 to certain employees of the Company. The vesting period for the restricted stock units varies between one and three years. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, 24,996 restricted stock units with an intrinsic value of $5.81 vested. As of March 31, 2019, there was $295,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to our unvested restricted stock units, which will be recognized through 2021. 
 As described further in "Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", we adopted Topic 842 as of January 1, 2019. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under Topic 840. 
 Generally, our leasing activity consists of office leases. As of January 1, 2019, we had three existing leases for office space. In October 2015, we signed a three-year lease extension for our 16,059 square-foot corporate headquarters in Morrisville, NC. This lease expires on October 31, 2019 and as of January 1, 2019, we had remaining minimum lease payments of $135,000. An ROU asset and corresponding lease liability was recorded for this amount on January 1, 2019. 
 Additionally, we have an office in Salt Lake City, Utah and a shared office facility in London, England, both of which are on short-term leases that are less than twelve months. As a result, we have elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for our Utah and London office leases, which means, for those leases that qualify, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities. 
 In connection with the Company’s acquisition of VWP (See Note 3), the Company assumed two short term leases in New York City, NY and entered into a three-year office lease in Florida. We have elected the short term lease exemption for the two New York leases. For the Florida lease, which was signed on January 4, 2019, we recognized a ROU asset and corresponding lease liability of $125,000, which represents the present value of minimum lease payments discounted at 4.25%, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at lease inception. 
 ROU assets totaled $186,000 as of March 31, 2019 and are included in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated balance sheets. Lease liabilities totaled $209,000 as of March 31, 2019. The current portion of this liability of $135,000 is included in accrued expenses on the Consolidated balance sheets and the long-term portion of $74,000 is included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 In March 2019, we signed a new lease to move our corporate headquarters to Raleigh, North Carolina. As we continue our transition from a services based company to a cloud-based platform company, the new lease affords us the ability to separate our warehouse from our corporate office. The new lease, which is scheduled to commence at the later of the date tenant improvements are completed (as defined in the lease) or August 1, 2019, is for 9,766 square feet and has a term of eight years and four months. Minimum lease payments are $2,997,000, not including a tenant improvement allowance up to $488,000, which will be reflected in the balance sheet upon lease commencement date. 
 We have performed an evaluation of our other contracts with customers and suppliers in accordance with Topic 842 and have determined that, except for the leases described above, none of our contracts contain a lease. 
 No customers accounted for more than 10% of the operating revenues during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 or 2018. 
 Effective October 4, 2018, the Company renewed its Line of Credit, which increased the amount of funds available for borrowing from $2,500,000 to $3,000,000. The interest rate was reduced from LIBOR plus 2.50% to LIBOR plus 1.75%. As of March 31, 2019, the interest rate was 4.22% and the Company did not owe any amounts on the Line of Credit. 
  Overview 
 Issuer Direct Corporation (Issuer Direct Corporation and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as “Issuer Direct”, the “Company”, “We” or “Our” unless otherwise noted). Our corporate offices are located at 500 Perimeter Park Drive, Suite D, Morrisville, North Carolina, 27560. 
 Issuer Direct® is a premier provider of communications and compliance technology solutions that are designed to help organizations tell their stories globally. Issuer Direct's principal platform, Platform id., empowers users by thoughtfully integrating the most relevant tools, technologies and products, thus eliminating the complexity associated with producing and distributing their business communications and financial information. 
 We work with a diverse customer base, which includes not only corporate issuers and private companies, but also investment banks, professional firms, such as investor relations and public relations firms, as well as the accounting and legal communities. We also sell products and services to others in the financial services industry, including brokerage firms and mutual funds. Our customers and their service providers utilize Platform id. and related services from document creation all the way to dissemination to regulatory bodies, platforms and shareholders. Private companies primarily use our news distribution and webcasting products and services to disseminate their message globally. Regardless of the message, Platform id.’s intelligent subscription platform guides thousands of customers through the process to communicate their message to a large audience. 
  Platform and Technology 
 We plan to continue to invest in both our current Platform id. offerings as well as additional offerings that we plan to incorporate into our Platform. These new offerings will further help establish our ecosystem and strategy of bringing the issuer and investor closer together. One of these opportunities is helping public issuers better understand the shareholder composition of their company, which we believe is an area that is underserved by the market today. 
 Platform id. is our primary cloud-based subscription platform that efficiently and effectively helps manage the events of our customers seeking to distribute their messaging to key constituents, investors, markets and regulatory systems around the globe. Currently, Platform id. consists of several related but distinct shareholder communications and compliance modules. Certain of these capabilities were historically part of our disclosure management and shareholder communications offerings, but are now included in our fully integrated platform. 
  Communications Modules 
 Our press release offering, which is marketed under the brand, ACCESSWIRE, is a cost-effective, Regulation Fair Disclosure (“FD”), news dissemination and media outreach service. The ACCESSWIRE product offering focuses on press release distribution for both private and publicly held companies globally. ACCESSWIRE is fast becoming a competitive alternative to the traditional newswires because we have been able to integrate customer editing features and improve our targeting and growing analytics reporting systems, which we believe will enable us to add new customers for 2019 and beyond. We have also been able to maintain flexible pricing by offering our customers the option to pay per release or enter into longer-term, flat-fee subscriptions. Currently, ACCESSWIRE is available within Platform id. as part of a subscription, or as a stand-alone module. Currently approximately 55% of our ACCESSWIRE revenue is on a subscription basis, something we believe will continue to grow. 
 On July 3, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Filing Services Canada Inc. (“FSCwire”), which not only increased our customer base, but more importantly increased our global footprint, distribution capabilities and editorial team of our press release business. During the latter part of 2018, we completed the integration of FSCwire and rebranded it as ACCESSWIRE Canada, and have now begun to focus on offering those customers the full suite of products included in Platform id. 
 At the end of 2018, we released a new module to Platform id., centered around the professional conference organizer (PCO). This subscription is being licensed to investor conference organizers, which together hold an estimated 1,000 plus events a year. This cloud-based product is integrated within, and enhances our communications module subscription offerings of newswire, newsrooms, webcasting and shareholder targeting. 
 This cloud-based platform offers organizers, issuers and investors the ability to register, request and approve 1x1 meetings, manage schedules, event promotion and sponsorship, badge printing, lodging management and mobile apps. We believe, by combining this module with the other components of Platform id., that it gives us a unique offering for PCOs that is not available elsewhere in the market. 
 Entering this business expands our current Platform and Technology revenue base, and as an adjacency, should assist in making Platform id. the core ecosystem of choice for investment banks, issuers and investors. 
  Investor Network 
 Over the past two years, we have been focused on refining the model of digital distribution of our customers’ message to the investment community and beyond. This has been accomplished by integrating our shareholder outreach module, formerly known as Investor Network, into and with Platform id. Most of the customers subscribing to this module today are historical PrecisionIR (“PIR”) – Annual Report Service (“ARS”) users, as well as new customers purchasing the entire Platform id. subscription. We have migrated some of the customers from the traditional ARS business into this new digital subscription business. However, there can be no assurances these customers will continue using this digital platform in the long term if market conditions or shareholder interest is not present. 
 We have also attempted to differentiate our offering by investing time and financial resources developing and integrating systems and processes within Platform id. and creating an application programming interface (“API”). This API allows customers, such as financial content sites and investment banks to query an industry or a single company’s current and past earnings calls and present those webcasts on their platforms, under a subscription to Platform id. Initially, this has been broadly distributed via our Investor Network platform, with expectations that customers will license this dataset for their platforms in the future. We believe this offering will further increase our brand awareness. Additionally, as a commitment to broadening the reach of our webcast platform, all events are broadcast live within our shareholder outreach module, which helps drive new audiences and give companies the ability to view their analytics and engagement of each event. We believe these analytics, which feeds into our Insight and Analytics module, will increase the demand for our webcasting platform among the corporate issuer community. 
 On January 3, 2019, we acquired the VisualWebcaster Platform (“VWP”) from Onstream Media Corporation. VWP is a leading cloud-based webcast, webinar and training platform that delivers live and on-demand streaming of events to audiences of all sizes. VWP allows customers to create, produce and deliver events, which we believe will integrate well into Platform id. We believe by acquiring VWP, we have significantly strengthened our webcasting product and Platform id. offering as well as acquired over 120 customers, ranging from small private companies to Fortune 500 companies. The VWP technology enables us the ability to host thousands of additional webcasts each year, expanding our webcast business from our historical earnings based events to now be able to host corporate meetings, trainings and town hall types of events. As we expand our platform it is vital for us to have solutions that can be consumed both to our core public companies but also a growing segment of private customers. 
  Investor Relations Content 
 Our investor relations content network is another component of Platform id., which is used to create the investor relations’ tab of a public company’s website. This investor relations content network is a robust series of data feeds including news feeds, stock feeds, fundamentals, regulatory filings, corporate governance and many other components that are aggregated from a majority of the major exchanges and news distribution outlets around the world. Customers can subscribe to one or more of these data feeds from us or as a component of a fully designed and hosted website for pre-IPO, reporting companies and partners seeking to display our content on their corporate sites. The clear benefit to our investor relations module is its integration into and with the rest of Platform id., meaning companies can produce content for public distribution and it is automatically linked to their corporate site, distributed to targeted groups and placed into and with our data feed partners. 
 Platform id.’s disclosure reporting module is a document conversion, editing and filing offering, which is designed for reporting companies and professionals seeking to insource the document drafting, editing and filing processes to the SEC’s EDGAR system and SEDAR, which is the Canadian equivalent of EDGAR. This module is available in both a secure public cloud within our Platform id. subscription, as well as in a private cloud option for corporations, mutual funds and the legal community looking to further enhance their internal document process. As this module has begun to be adopted by our customers, we have seen a negative impact on our legacy disclosure conversion services business. However, the margins associated with our Platform and Technology business compared to our Services business are higher and align with our long-term strategy, and as such, we believe this module will have a positive impact on our compliance business going forward. 
 Toward the end of 2017, we completed upgrades to our disclosure reporting product to include tagging functionality that meets newly mandated SEC requirements. On June 28, 2018, the SEC voted to adopt rules mandating the use of Inline XBRL (Inline Extensible Business Reporting Language or “iXBRL”) for the submission of financial statement information to the SEC. The new requirements for iXBRL will have a three-year phase in beginning for large accelerated filers that use U.S. GAAP to be compliant for fiscal periods ending on or after June 15, 2019, for accelerated filers to begin reporting for fiscal periods ending on or after June 15, 2020 and for all other filers to begin reporting for fiscal periods ending on or after June 15, 2021. These upgrades also include meeting new SEC mandates for foreign filers that compile financial statements using International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) to be able to utilize our cloud-based platform. Foreign filers with fiscal year’s ending on or after December 15, 2017, are now required to begin reporting their financial statements in XBRL with the SEC in 2018. Platform id. has adopted the new IFRS taxonomy into and with its new disclosure upgrade for iXBRL to ensure our customers are able to meet these new mandates. 
 A valued subscription add-on in our Platform id. offering is the ability for our customers to gain access to real-time information of their shareholders, stock ledgers and reports and to issue new shares from our cloud-based stock transfer module. Managing the capitalization table of a public company or pre-IPO company is a cornerstone of corporate governance and transparency, and as such companies and community banks have chosen us to assist with their stock transfer needs, including bond offerings and dividend management. This is an industry which has experienced declining overall revenues as it was affected by the replacement of paper certificates with digital certificates. However, we have been focused on selling subscriptions of the stock transfer component of our platform, allowing customers to gain access to our cloud-based system in order to move shares or query shareholders, which has resulted in a more efficient process for both our customers and us. 
 Our investor outreach and engagement offering, formerly known as ARS, was acquired from PIR in 2013. The ARS business has existed for over 20 years primarily as a physical hard copy delivery service of annual reports and prospectuses. We continue to operate a portion of this legacy system for those who opt to take advantage of physical delivery of material. Additionally, we continue to attempt to migrate the install base over to subscriptions of our digital outreach engagement module within Platform id. We believe we will continue to see further attrition of both customers and revenues in this category as we focus our efforts on our Platform and Technology business. 
  Revenues 
 Total revenue increased by $649,000, or 18%, to $4,179,000 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $3,530,000 during the same period of 2018. Revenue from customers obtained from our acquisitions of VWP and FSCwire totaled $627,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2019. A portion of this revenue is included in both the Platform and Technology and Services revenue streams. 
 No customers accounted for more than 10% of the revenues during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 or 2018. 
  General and Administrative Expense 
 As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses were 33% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, an increase from 28% for the same period of 2018. 
  Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense were 20% during the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, compared to 21% for the same period of the prior year. 
  Product Development Expenses 
 As a percentage of revenue, product development expenses were 8% for both the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $70,000, or 49%, during the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period of 2018. The increase is due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in both the VWP and FSCwire acquisitions. 
  Interest income (expense), net 
 Interest income (expense), net, represents interest income on deposit and money market accounts, partially offset by the non-cash interest associated with the present value of the remaining anniversary payments of the Interwest acquisition. 
  Net Income 
 Net income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, was $205,000, compared to $320,000 for the same period of 2018. 
 As of March 31, 2019, we had $14,961,000 in cash and cash equivalents and $2,237,000 in net accounts receivable. Current liabilities at March 31, 2019, totaled $3,338,000 including our accounts payable, deferred revenue, accrued payroll liabilities, income taxes payable, current portion of remaining payments for Interwest, lease liabilities and other accrued expenses. At March 31, 2019, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by $14,220,000. 
 Effective October 4, 2018, the Company renewed its Line of Credit, which increased the amount of funds available for borrowing from $2,500,000 to $3,000,000. The interest rate was reduced from LIBOR plus 2.50% to LIBOR plus 1.75%. As of March 31, 2019, the interest rate was 4.22% and the Company did not owe any amounts on the Line of Credit. 
 One of our competitive strengths is that we have embraced cloud computing early on in our strategy. The transition to a subscription model has been and will continue to be key for the long-term sustainable growth management expects from our new platforms.

 We believe there is significant demand for our products among the middle, small and micro-cap markets globally, as they seek to find better platforms and tools to disseminate and communicate their respective messages. We believe we have the product sets, platforms and capacity to meet their requirements. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form10-Q, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).
