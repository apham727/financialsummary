 Overview 
Our Company 
We design, manufacture and market a broad array of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits. These products are primarily used in the networking, telecommunications, computing, military, aerospace, transportation and broadcasting industries. Bel’s portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive, medical and consumer electronics markets. 
Key Factors Affecting our Business 
Sales declines in each of our segments during the third quarter of 2019 reflected lower sales into our distribution channel as our distribution partners continue to work down their level of inventory on hand. Sales of our connector products into military applications were also lower during the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018, impacting our North America segment sales. Sales in our Asia segment in the third quarter of 2019 were down versus 2018 as a result of customers working down heightened inventory levels which had been built up during 2018 in response to new product launches and the tariffs that went into effect in 2018 and 2019. 
Net sales and (loss) income from operations by operating segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows. Segment net sales are attributed to individual segments based on the geographic source of the billing for customer sales. 
Net Sales 
Sales of our Connectivity Solutions products during the third quarter of 2019 declined $4.0 million primarily due to lower demand from military customers as compared to last year's third quarter, and reduced volume of product flowing through our distribution channels as our distribution partners continue to work down inventory levels that had been built up in 2018 ahead of the tariffs. These factors also impacted the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019, which declined $8.9 million from the same period of 2018, partially offset by higher sales to commercial aerospace customers during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. 
Sales of our Magnetic Solutions products during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were down $13.3 million and $18.0 million, respectively, from the same periods of 2018 while inventory levels built up in advance of a customer's new program launch during 2018 are worked through. 
Sales of our Power Solutions and Protection products were $4.7 million lower in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter of 2018. Sales of our Bel Power Solutions products into datacenter applications decreased by $3.8 million and sales of our Circuit Protection products were $0.9 million lower as compared to last year’s third quarter. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in sales of our Custom Module products. Sales during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $1.2 million from the same period of 2018, as stronger sales into datacenter applications during the first quarter of 2019 lessened the impact of sales declines during the second and third quarters of 2019. 
Cost of Sales 
Labor costs as a percentage of sales declined during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods of 2018 as a more favorable exchange rate environment related to the Chinese Renminbi offset the overall impact of minimum wage increases in the PRC and Mexico. The PRC government increased the minimum wage in the regions where Bel’s factories are located in February and July of 2018. The minimum wage rates in Mexico increased effective January 1, 2019. 
The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $0.6 million and ($2.2) million, respectively. The Company’s earnings before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2019, were approximately $15.1 million lower than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to the $8.9 million impairment of goodwill in North America, as well as lower earnings in the North America and Asia segments. The Company’s effective tax rate was (10.0%) and (24.1%) for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, is primarily attributable to a decrease in U.S. taxes relating to income from foreign subsidiaries taxed in the U.S. as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, the change in the tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is attributable to a decrease in tax expense in the North America segment due to the reduction in the estimated transition tax on post-1986 untaxed accumulated foreign earnings as well as a decrease in the taxes related to uncertain tax positions during the 2018 period. See Note 10, “Income Taxes.” 
The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The Company’s earnings before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were approximately $18.5 million lower than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to the $8.9 million impairment of goodwill in North America, as well as lower earnings in the North America and Asia segments. The Company’s effective tax rate was (78.2%) and 3.0% for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018, is primarily attributable to the same factors noted above related to the third quarter, as well as the impact from permanent tax differences on U.S. tax-exempt activities during the first quarter of 2019. 
Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable comprised approximately 33.1% of the Company’s total assets at September 30, 2019 and 32.9% of total assets at December 31, 2018. The Company’s current ratio (i.e., the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 3.2 to 1 at September 30, 2019 and 2.7 to 1 at December 31, 2018. 
In June 2014, the Company entered into a senior Credit and Security Agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2016, and further amended and refinanced in December 2017. The Credit and Security Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined (“Leverage Ratio”), and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA to the Company’s consolidated fixed charges (“Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio”). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit and Security Agreement would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. The unused credit available under the credit facility at September 30, 2019 was $75.0 million, of which we had the ability to borrow $40.6 million without violating our Leverage Ratio covenant based on the Company’s existing consolidated EBITDA. 
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 
   •  net cash provided by operating activities of $18.9 million; partially offset by    
   •  purchases of property, plant and equipment of $8.2 million;    
   •  dividend payments of $2.4 million; and    
   •  repayments of long-term debt of $2.2 million    
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, accounts receivable decreased by $12.4 million primarily due to lower sales during the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased slightly to 58 days at September 30, 2019 from 59 days at December 31, 2018. Inventory decreased by $8.4 million at September 30, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. Inventory turns were 3.7 at each of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 
   •  purchases of property, plant and equipment of $8.8 million;    
   •  dividend payments of $2.4 million; partially offset by    
   •  net cash provided by operations of $4.2 million.    
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, accounts receivable increased by $19.0 million primarily due to higher sales volume in the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 61 days at September 30, 2018 from 60 days at December 31, 2017. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company implemented a change in the timing of revenue recognition (and related release of inventory from our books) in connection with the adoption of ASC 606. Excluding the adoption adjustment related to this accounting change, inventory increased by $20.1 million at September 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily in raw materials. The increased raw materials balance was driven by a higher volume of raw materials purchased to accommodate increased demand for our products, coupled with higher material costs in 2018 resulting from constraints in component availability. Inventory turns increased from 3.6 at December 31, 2017 to 4.0 at September 30, 2018, primarily due to the change in revenue recognition accounting noted above.
