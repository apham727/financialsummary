  Overview 
Our Company 
We design, manufacture and market a broad array of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits. These products are primarily used in the networking, telecommunications, computing, military, aerospace, transportation and broadcasting industries. Bel's portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive, medical and consumer electronics markets. 
Key Factors Affecting our Business 
  ·   Revenues – The Company's revenues increased by $4.6 million (or 4.0%) in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the same period of 2017, despite a $1.6 million decline in sales related to the NPS divestiture. The majority of the sales growth in the first quarter related to strong demand for our Magnetic Solutions products, particularly our integrated connector modules within industrial, Ethernet and server markets. Sales of our Connectivity Solutions products were also higher in the first quarter of 2018 with an increase in demand related to various military programs and within the industrial market for oil and gas, test and measurement, and broadcasting applications. Our Power Solutions and Protection group, excluding the effects of our divested NPS business, also contributed to our year-over-year sales growth.     
  ·   Backlog – Our backlog reached $178.3 million at March 31, 2018, representing an increase of $31.8 million, or 22%, from December 31, 2017. Since year-end, we saw a 33% increase in the backlog at Connectivity Solutions, driven by recent awards on key military programs, and a 25% increase at Magnetic Solutions, driven by demand for our multi-gig variants of ICMs from our key networking customers. Our Power Solutions and Protection backlog grew by 12%, led by higher demand for our power supplies in the industrial and rail industries, and orders from new customers within the E-Mobility, Internet of Things and Blockchain segments.

  ·   Labor Costs – Labor costs during the first quarter of 2018 increased from 10.2% of sales during the first quarter of 2017 to 11.3% of sales during the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to the appreciation of the Renminbi and Peso against the U.S. Dollar, minimum wage increases in the PRC, and growth in sales of our labor-intensive integrated connector module (ICM) products.

Net sales and income from operations by operating segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows. Segment net sales are attributed to individual segments based on the geographic source of the billing for customer sales. 
Net Sales 
Our connectivity solutions products showed an overall improvement in sales of $1.2 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017. Sales within our Cinch businesses were strong in 2018, up $0.7 million from the first quarter of 2017, led by increased activity within key military-aerospace programs and higher sales through our distribution channels. Our Stewart business added to the growth within this group in 2018, contributing $0.5 million of additional sales in 2018 versus the 2017 period as it was successful in expanding the presence of its products within distribution channels.

Cost of Sales 
Labor costs as a percentage of sales also increased during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017 due to several factors. The appreciation of the Renminbi and the Peso against the U.S. Dollar drove labor costs as a percentage of sales higher in 2018, as the majority of our sales related to product manufactured in the PRC and Mexico are invoiced in U.S. Dollars, while our manufacturing staff in those locations are paid in local currency. In addition, wage rates in the PRC, which are mandated by the government, now have higher minimum wage and overtime requirements. Effective February 1, 2018, the PRC issued an increase to the minimum wage in a region where one of Bel's factories is located, and this contributed to the higher labor costs in the 2018 period. Lastly, there was a 9.7% increase in sales of our ICM products in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Our ICM products are labor-intensive in nature and the manufacturing staff related to those products is located in the PRC.

The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $0.3 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively. The Company's earnings (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were approximately $1.7 lower than the same period in 2017, primarily attributable to significant losses in the Asia and North America segments. The Company's effective tax rate was (33.2%) and (3.2%) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, is primarily attributable to a decrease in the benefit arising from the losses in the North America segment due to the reduction in the U.S. tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018. Additionally, there was an increase in the liability for uncertain tax positions in the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. See Note 9, "Income Taxes." 
Our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit, including our credit facility. Our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses, investments in working capital, capital expenditures, interest, taxes, dividends, debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. We believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations, including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months. 
Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable comprised approximately 33.0% of the Company's total assets at March 31, 2018 and 34.4% of total assets at December 31, 2017. The Company's current ratio (i.e., the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 3.1 to 1 at March 31, 2018 and 3.0 to 1 at December 31, 2017. 
In June 2014, the Company entered into a senior Credit and Security Agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2016, and further amended and refinanced in December 2017. The Credit and Security Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA, as defined ("Leverage Ratio"), and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA to the Company's consolidated fixed charges ("Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio"). If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit and Security Agreement would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. At March 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Leverage Ratio. The unused credit available under the credit facility at March 31, 2018 was $75.0 million, of which we had the ability to borrow $25.7 million without violating our Leverage Ratio covenant based on the Company's existing consolidated EBITDA.

  ·   purchases of property, plant and equipment of $2.2 million;     
  ·   dividend payments of $0.8 million; partially offset by     
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, accounts receivable decreased by $2.5 million primarily due to lower sales volume in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Days sales outstanding (DSO) declined to 58 days at March 31, 2018 from 60 days at December 31, 2017. Inventory increased by $4.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to a change in the timing of revenue recognition (and related release of inventory from our books) in connection with the adoption of ASC 606, as described in Note 2. This change in accounting was also the main driver in an increase in inventory turns from 3.6 at December 31, 2017 to 3.8 at March 31, 2018. 
Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 
  ·   purchases of property, plant and equipment of $1.0 million; and

  ·   net borrowings of long-term debt during the quarter of $1.5 million.     
During the three months ended March 31, 2017, accounts receivable decreased by $2.0 million primarily due to lower sales volume in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 58 days at March 31, 2017 from 54 days at December 31, 2016, primary due to a 32% increase in sales from February to March 2017. Inventory levels were up by $2.4 million at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 as raw materials and work in progress balances increased from year-end levels to accommodate the anticipated increase in sales for the second half of 2017.
