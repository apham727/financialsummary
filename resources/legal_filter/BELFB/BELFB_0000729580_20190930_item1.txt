The Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, except as discussed in “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards” below. 
All amounts included in the tables to these notes to condensed consolidated financial statements, except per share amounts, are in thousands. 
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), to provide a new comprehensive model for lease accounting. Under this guidance, lessees and lessors should apply a “right-of-use” model in accounting for all leases (including subleases) and eliminate the concept of operating leases and off-balance sheet leases. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. Similar modifications have been made to lessor accounting in-line with revenue recognition guidance. This guidance was effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments also require certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements. 
The Company adopted ASU 2016-02, as amended, effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. In connection with the adoption, we elected to utilize the Comparatives Under 840 Option whereby the Company will continue to present prior period financial statements and disclosures under ASC 840. In addition, we elected the transition package of three practical expedients permitted within the standard, which eliminates the requirements to reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. Further, we elected a short-term lease exception policy, permitting us to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e. leases with terms of 12 months or less) and an accounting policy to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component for certain classes of assets. We implemented a new lease system to facilitate the requirements of the new standard and completed the necessary changes to our accounting policies, processes, disclosures and internal control over financial reporting.

The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have not been satisfied as of September 30, 2019 related to contracts that exceed one year in duration amounted to $15.7 million, with expected contract expiration dates that range from 2020 - 2025. It is expected that 20% of this aggregate amount will be recognized in 2020, 57% will be recognized in 2021 and the remainder will be recognized in years beyond 2021.

Level 3 – Unobservable inputs about which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale securities primarily consisted of investments held in a rabbi trust which are intended to fund the Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) obligations. These securities are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) inputs and amounted to $1.2 million at September 30, 2019 and $1.4 million at December 31, 2018. The Company does not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 or September 30, 2018. There were no changes to the Company’s valuation techniques used to measure asset fair values on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 or September 30, 2018. 
There were no financial assets accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018.

The Company has other financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, which are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow method based on interest rates that are currently available for debt issuances with similar terms and maturities. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of total debt was $116.8 million and $117.9 million, respectively, compared to a carrying amount of $112.3 million and $114.2 million, respectively. The Company did not have any other financial liabilities within the scope of the fair value disclosure requirements as of September 30, 2019. 
The July 31, 2019 interim impairment test related to the Company's goodwill was performed by reporting unit (North America and Europe). The valuation test, which heavily weights future discounted cash flow projections, indicated impairment of the goodwill associated with the Company’s North America reporting unit. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $8.9 million ($8.5 million after-tax) during the third quarter of 2019. The Company’s goodwill associated with its North America reporting unit originated from several of Bel’s prior acquisitions, primarily Power Solutions and Connectivity Solutions. The carrying value of the Company's goodwill was $19.8 million at December 31, 2018. The remaining goodwill as of September 30, 2019 has a carrying value of $10.8 million related solely to the Company's Europe reporting unit. See Note 5, Goodwill.  
The Company had also performed an interim impairment analysis of its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of July 31, 2019. The Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment using a fair value approach, the relief-from-royalty method (a form of the income approach). At December 31, 2018, the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the trademarks acquired in the Power Solutions, Connectivity Solutions, Cinch and Fibreco acquisitions. The Company's interim test on its indefinite-lived intangible assets indicated that the carrying value of its long-lived assets was recoverable and that no impairment existed as of the July 31, 2019 testing date.  
During the second quarter of 2019, the Company transitioned its manufacturing and warehousing operations from its Inwood, New York facility to Bel’s existing facilities in Glen Rock, Pennsylvania and the Dominican Republic. In connection with this transition, the Company sold its Inwood, New York property during the second quarter of 2019, which resulted in net proceeds of $5.8 million. The accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 includes a related gain on sale of $4.3 million (pre-tax).

In connection with the acquisition of Power Solutions, there is an ongoing claim by the Arezzo Revenue Agency in Italy concerning certain tax matters related to what was then Power-One Asia Pacific Electronics Shenzhen Co. Ltd. (now Bel Power Solutions Asia Pacific Electronics Shenzhen Co. Ltd, or “BPS China”) for the years 2004 to 2006. In September 2012, the Tax Court of Arezzo ruled in favor of BPS China and cancelled the claim. In February 2013, the Arezzo Revenue Agency filed an appeal of the Tax Court’s ruling. The hearing of the appeal was held on October 2, 2014. On October 13, 2014, BPS China was informed of the Regional Tax Commission of Florence ruling which was in favor of the Arezzo Revenue Agency and against BPS China. An appeal was filed on July 18, 2015 before the Regional Tax Commission of Florence and rejected. On December 5, 2016, the Arezzo Revenue Agency filed an appeal with the Supreme Court and BPS China filed a counter-appeal on January 4, 2017. The Supreme Court has yet to render its judgment. The estimated liability related to this matter is approximately $12.0 million and has been included as a liability for uncertain tax positions on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As Bel is fully indemnified in this matter per the terms of the stock purchase agreement with ABB, a corresponding other asset for indemnification is also included in other assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
