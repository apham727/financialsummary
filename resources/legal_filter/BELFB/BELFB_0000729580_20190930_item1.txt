The Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, except as discussed in “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards” below. 
All amounts included in the tables to these notes to condensed consolidated financial statements, except per share amounts, are in thousands. 
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), to provide a new comprehensive model for lease accounting. Under this guidance, lessees and lessors should apply a “right-of-use” model in accounting for all leases (including subleases) and eliminate the concept of operating leases and off-balance sheet leases. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. Similar modifications have been made to lessor accounting in-line with revenue recognition guidance. This guidance was effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments also require certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements. 
The Company adopted ASU 2016-02, as amended, effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. In connection with the adoption, we elected to utilize the Comparatives Under 840 Option whereby the Company will continue to present prior period financial statements and disclosures under ASC 840. In addition, we elected the transition package of three practical expedients permitted within the standard, which eliminates the requirements to reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. Further, we elected a short-term lease exception policy, permitting us to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e. leases with terms of 12 months or less) and an accounting policy to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component for certain classes of assets. We implemented a new lease system to facilitate the requirements of the new standard and completed the necessary changes to our accounting policies, processes, disclosures and internal control over financial reporting. 
Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of right-of-use assets in the amount of $20.7 million and lease liabilities related to our operating leases in the amount of $21.0 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019. The standard did not materially affect the Company’s consolidated net earnings or have any impact on cash flows. See Note 13, Leases, for Topic 842 disclosures in connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-02. 
The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations that have not been satisfied as of September 30, 2019 related to contracts that exceed one year in duration amounted to $15.7 million, with expected contract expiration dates that range from 2020 - 2025. It is expected that 20% of this aggregate amount will be recognized in 2020, 57% will be recognized in 2021 and the remainder will be recognized in years beyond 2021.  
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs about which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale securities primarily consisted of investments held in a rabbi trust which are intended to fund the Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) obligations. These securities are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) inputs and amounted to $1.2 million at September 30, 2019 and $1.4 million at December 31, 2018. The Company does not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 or September 30, 2018. There were no changes to the Company’s valuation techniques used to measure asset fair values on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 or September 30, 2018. 
There were no financial assets accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018. 
The Company has other financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, which are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow method based on interest rates that are currently available for debt issuances with similar terms and maturities. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of total debt was $116.8 million and $117.9 million, respectively, compared to a carrying amount of $112.3 million and $114.2 million, respectively. The Company did not have any other financial liabilities within the scope of the fair value disclosure requirements as of September 30, 2019. 
Nonfinancial assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, are accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These items are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. We review goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis annually during the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. As weakened market conditions from earlier in 2019 continued into the third quarter without a visible rebound in incoming orders, the Company’s actual revenue and margin levels in 2019 were significantly lower than the financial projections utilized in the annual goodwill impairment analysis (performed as of October 1, 2018), and were not projected to rebound to those levels in 2019. The Company determined that current business conditions, and the resulting decrease in the Company’s projected undiscounted and discounted cash flows, together with the accompanying stock price decline, constituted a triggering event, which required the Company to perform interim impairment tests related to its long-lived assets and goodwill during the third quarter of 2019. The Company’s interim test on its long-lived assets indicated that the carrying value of its long-lived assets was recoverable and that no impairment existed as of the July 31, 2019 testing date.  
The July 31, 2019 interim impairment test related to the Company's goodwill was performed by reporting unit (North America and Europe). The valuation test, which heavily weights future discounted cash flow projections, indicated impairment of the goodwill associated with the Company’s North America reporting unit. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $8.9 million ($8.5 million after-tax) during the third quarter of 2019. The Company’s goodwill associated with its North America reporting unit originated from several of Bel’s prior acquisitions, primarily Power Solutions and Connectivity Solutions. The carrying value of the Company's goodwill was $19.8 million at December 31, 2018. The remaining goodwill as of September 30, 2019 has a carrying value of $10.8 million related solely to the Company's Europe reporting unit. See Note 5, Goodwill.  
Detailed below is a table of key underlying assumptions utilized in the fair value estimate calculation for the interim test performed as of July 31, 2019 as compared to those assumptions utilized during the annual valuation performed as of October 1, 2018. The table below shows the assumptions utilized for the North America reporting unit. 
The Company had also performed an interim impairment analysis of its indefinite-lived intangible assets as of July 31, 2019. The Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment using a fair value approach, the relief-from-royalty method (a form of the income approach). At December 31, 2018, the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the trademarks acquired in the Power Solutions, Connectivity Solutions, Cinch and Fibreco acquisitions. The Company's interim test on its indefinite-lived intangible assets indicated that the carrying value of its long-lived assets was recoverable and that no impairment existed as of the July 31, 2019 testing date.  
During the second quarter of 2019, the Company transitioned its manufacturing and warehousing operations from its Inwood, New York facility to Bel’s existing facilities in Glen Rock, Pennsylvania and the Dominican Republic. In connection with this transition, the Company sold its Inwood, New York property during the second quarter of 2019, which resulted in net proceeds of $5.8 million. The accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 includes a related gain on sale of $4.3 million (pre-tax).  
The change in warranty accrual during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily related to repair costs incurred and adjustments to pre-existing warranties. There were no new material warranty charges incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 
The Company has a Credit and Security Agreement with KeyBank National Association (as amended, the “CSA”). The CSA consists of (i) a term loan, with outstanding borrowings of $113.8 million and $116.0 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively and (ii) a $75 million revolving credit facility (“Revolver”), with no outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018. The CSA has a maturity date of December 11, 2022. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the carrying value of the debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheet is reflected net of $1.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of deferred financing costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company borrowed $12.0 million from its revolver, all of which was repaid by September 30, 2019. 
The CSA contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined, (“Leverage Ratio”) and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA to the Company’s consolidated fixed charges. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the CSA would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.  
As a result of the expiration of the statutes of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the related unrecognized benefits for tax positions taken regarding previously filed tax returns may change materially from those recorded as liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the Company’s consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2019. The Company’s liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaled $28.6 million and $28.9 million at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, of which $2.1 million and $1.4 million is included in other current liabilities at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. These amounts, if recognized, would reduce the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 30, 2019, approximately $2.1 million of the Company’s liabilities for uncertain tax positions are expected to be resolved during 2019 by way of expiration of the related statute of limitations. 
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the current provision for income taxes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in interest and penalties in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized a benefit of $0.7 million and a benefit of $0.3 million, respectively, for the reversal of such interest and penalties, relating to the settlement of the liability for uncertain tax positions. The Company has approximately $4.7 million and $3.8 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which is included in both income taxes payable and liability for uncertain tax positions in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
The Company maintains the Bel Fuse Inc. Employees’ Savings Plan, a defined contribution plan that is intended to meet the applicable requirements for tax-qualification under sections 401(a) and (k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $0.3 million in both periods. The expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $0.8 million in both periods. The Company’s matching contribution is made in the form of Bel Fuse Inc. Class A common stock. As of September 30, 2019, the plan owned 153,352 and 109,442 shares of Bel Fuse Inc. Class A and Class B common stock, respectively. 
Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 are as follows. All amounts are net of tax. 
The Company has operating leases for its facilities used for manufacturing, research and development, sales and administration. There are also operating and finance leases related to manufacturing equipment, office equipment and vehicles. These leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 1 year to 8 years. Certain of the leases contain options to extend the term of the lease and certain of the leases contain options to terminate the lease within a specified period of time. These options to extend or terminate a lease are included in the lease term only when it is reasonably likely that the Company will elect that option. The Company is not a party to any material sublease arrangements. 
Our discount rate is based on our incremental borrowing rate, as adjusted based on the geographic regions in which our leases assets are located. 
As of September 30, 2019, the Company did not have any additional operating or financing leases that have not yet commenced.  
In connection with the acquisition of Power Solutions, there is an ongoing claim by the Arezzo Revenue Agency in Italy concerning certain tax matters related to what was then Power-One Asia Pacific Electronics Shenzhen Co. Ltd. (now Bel Power Solutions Asia Pacific Electronics Shenzhen Co. Ltd, or “BPS China”) for the years 2004 to 2006. In September 2012, the Tax Court of Arezzo ruled in favor of BPS China and cancelled the claim. In February 2013, the Arezzo Revenue Agency filed an appeal of the Tax Court’s ruling. The hearing of the appeal was held on October 2, 2014. On October 13, 2014, BPS China was informed of the Regional Tax Commission of Florence ruling which was in favor of the Arezzo Revenue Agency and against BPS China. An appeal was filed on July 18, 2015 before the Regional Tax Commission of Florence and rejected. On December 5, 2016, the Arezzo Revenue Agency filed an appeal with the Supreme Court and BPS China filed a counter-appeal on January 4, 2017. The Supreme Court has yet to render its judgment. The estimated liability related to this matter is approximately $12.0 million and has been included as a liability for uncertain tax positions on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As Bel is fully indemnified in this matter per the terms of the stock purchase agreement with ABB, a corresponding other asset for indemnification is also included in other assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 
Goodwill Impairment - As discussed in Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, the Company recorded an $8.9 million non-cash impairment charge related to its North America goodwill in the third quarter of 2019. This charge impacted income from operations for the North America segment in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019.
