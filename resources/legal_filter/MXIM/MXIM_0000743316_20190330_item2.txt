Overview of Business
Net Revenues
Net revenues were $542.4 million and $648.6 million for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. Revenue from consumer products was down by 27%, mainly due to lower shipments in cell phone and home entertainment products, partially offset by higher shipments in wearable products. Revenue from industrial products was down by 18%, mainly due to a decline in shipments of control, automation and automatic test equipment products. Revenue from communications and data center products was down by 22%, due to generally lower shipments of server, network and data center products. These declines were partially offset by an increase in revenue from automotive products. Revenue from automotive products was up by 5%, driven by higher demand for battery management systems and driver assistance content. 
Net revenues were $1.8 billion for both the nine months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018. Revenue from automotive products was up by 7%, driven by higher demand for battery management systems and driver assistance content. Revenue from communications and data center products was down by 12% due to generally lower shipments of network, server, and data center products. Revenue from industrial products was down by 7%, driven by lower demand for control, automation, security and other industrial products, partially offset by higher demand for USB extension products. Revenue from consumer products was down by 6%, driven by lower demand for cell phone and home entertainment products, partially offset by higher demand for wearable 
and handheld computing products. The decrease in revenues in these markets was partially driven by the 13-week second quarter of fiscal year 2019, compared to the 14-week second quarter of fiscal year 2018. In addition, there was a one-time incremental $22.0 million of revenue recognized as a result of the sell-in accounting revenue transition during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.

No. 118 allowed the use of provisional amounts (reasonable estimates) if accounting for the income tax effects of the Act was not completed. Provisional amounts must be adjusted within a one-year measurement period from the enactment date of the Act. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company recorded a discrete $236.9 million provisional Transition Tax charge. During the measurement period the Company gathered information and analyzed available guidance to more precisely compute the amount of the Transition Tax. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 the Company completed this work and recorded a discrete $22.1 million measurement period adjustment for the Transition Tax, which increased the Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 30, 2019 by 3.8%. As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 accounting for the income tax effects of the Act were completed. 
The Act reduced the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in a fiscal year 2018 federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for the Company (average of a 35% rate for the first half of fiscal year 2018 and a 21% rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018). The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 21%. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 the Company recorded a $13.7 million discrete charge to remeasure deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the enactment date of the Act to reflect the federal statutory tax rate reductions.
The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was 28.1%. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and $4.6 million of discrete excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards, partially offset by $5.1 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits.

Financial Condition
Operating activities
Cash provided by operating activities was $638.4 million in the nine months ended March 30, 2019, a decrease of $34.4 million compared with the nine months ended March 31, 2018. This decrease was due to changes in working capital and adjustments for non-cash items, partially offset by higher net income. 
Investing activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of net investment purchases and maturities, and capital expenditures. 
Cash provided by investing activities was $785.4 million for the nine months ended March 30, 2019, compared with cash used in investing activities of $708.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, a change of $1.5 billion. The change was due to lower purchases of and higher proceeds from maturity of available-for-sale securities. 
Net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately $732.2 million for the nine months ended March 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2018. The increase was due to the repayment of the November 2018 Notes and repurchases of our common stock. 
As of March 30, 2019, our available funds consisted of $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements, including the anticipated level of capital expenditures, common stock repurchases, debt repayments and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. 
In November 2018, the Company repaid $500.0 million of principal and related outstanding interest of the Company's 2.5% coupon notes.

During the three and nine months ended March 30, 2019, we paid cash dividends of $0.46 and $1.38 per common share totaling $125.6 million and $380.2 million, respectively. 
As of March 30, 2019, we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
On July 20, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock. The stock repurchase authorization did not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity depended on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors. The Company's prior repurchase authorization was cancelled and superseded by this repurchase authorization.
