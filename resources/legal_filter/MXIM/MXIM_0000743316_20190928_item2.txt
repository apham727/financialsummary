The Linear and Mixed-Signal Analog Integrated Circuit Market
All electronic signals generally fall into one of two categories, linear or digital. Linear (or analog) signals represent real world phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, sound or speed, and are continuously variable over a wide range of values. Digital signals represent the “ones” and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and are either on or off.
•digital devices, such as memories and microprocessors that operate primarily in the digital domain;
•linear devices, such as amplifiers, references, analog multiplexers and switches that operate primarily in the analog domain; and

Net Revenues
Net revenues were $533.0 million and $638.5 million for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively. Revenue from industrial products was down by 21% due to lower shipments in control and automation and automatic test equipment products. Revenue from communication and data center products was down by 25% due to lower shipments in network and data communications, data center and other communications products. These results include net revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2018 that align with our revised end-market categories. 
During the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, approximately 90% and 89% of net revenues, respectively, were derived from customers outside of the United States. While less than 1.0% of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate our risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue and results of operations for the three months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 was immaterial.

Financial Condition
Operating activities
Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $65.9 million for the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared with the three months ended September 29, 2018 due to lower net income, partially offset by changes in working capital.
Investing activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of net investment purchases and maturities, and capital expenditures. 
Cash provided by investing activities decreased by $74.6 million for the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared with the three months ended September 29, 2018. The decrease was due to lower proceeds from maturity of available-for-sale securities and lower purchases of available-for-sale securities. 
Cash used in financing activities decreased by $23.0 million for the three months ended September 28, 2019 compared with the three months ended September 29, 2018 due to lower share repurchases. 
Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operating activities resulting from net income and management of working capital.
As of September 28, 2019, our available funds consisted of $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. 
On October 30, 2018, we were authorized to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of the Company's common stock. During the three months ended September 28, 2019, we repurchased an aggregate of $93.6 million of the Company's common stock.
During the three months ended September 28, 2019, we paid cash dividends of $0.48 per common share totaling $130.2 million. 
We anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements, including the anticipated level of capital expenditures, common stock repurchases, debt repayments and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. 
As of September 28, 2019, we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
In the three months ended September 28, 2019, the Company repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stock for approximately $93.6 million. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had remaining authorization of $1.0 billion for future share repurchases. The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors, including the price of the Company’s common stock and general market and business conditions.
