Effect of hedge accounting on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income
Outstanding debt obligations
On June 15, 2017, the Company completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.45% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due in June 2027 (“2027 Notes”), with an effective interest rate of 3.5%. Interest on 
the 2027 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2017. The net proceeds of this offering were approximately $495.2 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting paid expenses.
On November 21, 2013, the Company completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 2.5% coupon senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due in November 2018 (“2018 Notes”), with an effective interest rate of 2.6%. Interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on May 15, 2014. The net proceeds of this offering were approximately $494.5 million, after issuing at a discount and deducting paid expenses. In November of 2018, the Company repaid the entire $500 million in principal and any outstanding interest, related to these outstanding notes.
The debt indentures that govern the 2027 Notes and the 2023 Notes include covenants that limit the Company's ability to grant liens on its facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, which could limit the Company's ability to secure additional debt funding in the future. In circumstances involving a change of control of the Company followed by a downgrade of the rating of the 2027 Notes or the 2023 Notes, the Company would be required to make an offer to repurchase the affected notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
The Company accounts for all the notes above based on their amortized cost. The discount and expenses are being amortized to Interest and other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income over the life of the notes. The interest expense is recorded in Interest and other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Amortized discount and expenses, as well as interest expense associated with the notes, were $8.9 million and $12.4 million during the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. Amortized discount and expenses, as well as interest expense associated with the notes, were $32.5 million and $37.1 million during the nine months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
The estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt obligations was approximately $985 million as of March 30, 2019. The estimated fair value of the debt is based primarily on observable market inputs and is a Level 2 measurement.
The Company recorded interest expense of $9.3 million and $12.4 million during the three months ended March 30, 2019, and March 31, 2018, respectively. The Company recorded interest expense of $33.9 million and $37.6 million during the nine months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. 
For the balance of the Company’s financial instruments, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. 
Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options is determined to be the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Options typically vest ratably over a four-year period measured from the date of grant. Options generally expire no later than seven years after the date of grant, subject to earlier termination upon an optionee's cessation of employment or service. 
RSUs granted to employees typically vest ratably over a four-year period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period. RSUs granted after August 2017 will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements. 
MSUs granted to employees typically vest over a four-year cliff period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period. The number of shares that are 
released at the end of the performance period can range from zero to a maximum cap depending on the Company's performance. MSUs granted after August 2017 will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements.
The expenses included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for RSUs include expenses related to MSUs of $3.0 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively, and $8.3 million and $5.8 million for the nine months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. 
Stock Options
The fair value of options granted to employees under the 1996 Plan is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. 
There were no stock options granted in the three and nine months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018. 
Restricted Stock Units and Other Awards
The fair value of RSUs and other awards under the Company’s 1996 Plan is estimated using the value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company’s common stock prior to vesting. The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis. 
The weighted-average fair value of RSUs and other awards granted was $51.01 and $54.81 per share for the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively, and $54.04 and $44.49 per share for the nine months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. 
The Company withheld shares totaling $23.0 million in value as a result of employee withholding taxes based on the value of RSUs on vesting date for the nine months ended March 30, 2019. Total payments for employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities are reflected as financing activities within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
As of March 30, 2019, there was $162.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to 5.3 million unvested RSUs and other awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.7 years. 
The weighted-average fair value of MSUs granted was $75.48 and $51.03 per share for the nine months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. 
As of March 30, 2019, there was $31.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to 1.0 million unvested MSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.7 years. 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Employees are granted rights to acquire common stock under the 2008 ESPP.
As of March 30, 2019, there was $5.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to the 2008 ESPP.
Basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For purposes of computing basic earnings per share, the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock 
excludes unvested RSUs and other awards as well as MSUs. Diluted earnings per share incorporates the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options, assumed release of unvested RSUs and other awards as well as MSUs, and assumed issuance of common stock under the 2008 ESPP using the treasury stock method.
For the three months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, and the nine months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, no stock awards were determined to be anti-dilutive. Therefore, none were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. 
Enterprise-wide information is provided in accordance with ASC 280. Geographical revenue information is based on customers’ ship-to location.

The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was 28.1%. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and $4.6 million of discrete excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards, partially offset by $5.1 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to a $236.9 million discrete provisional charge for the Transition Tax, a $13.7 million discrete charge to remeasure deferred taxes as of the enactment date of the Act, and $13.1 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates and $8.3 million of discrete excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards.
Pursuant to the Company's charter documents and separate written indemnification agreements, the Company has certain indemnification obligations to its current officers, employees and directors, as well as certain former officers and directors.
On July 20, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of the Company's common stock. The stock repurchase authorization did not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity depended on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors. All prior repurchase 
authorizations by the Company’s Board of Directors for the repurchase of common stock were cancelled and superseded by this repurchase authorization.
