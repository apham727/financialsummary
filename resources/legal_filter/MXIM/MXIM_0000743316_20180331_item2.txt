Revenue from consumer products was up 31%, primarily due to higher shipments of products for smartphones. Revenue from automotive products was up 10%, primarily driven by growth in infotainment.

On July 20, 2017, the board of directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock. The stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors. The Company's prior repurchase authorization was cancelled and superseded by this new repurchase authorization.
In the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of its common stock for approximately $127.7 million.

The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors, including the price of the Company’s common stock and general market and business conditions.
