Financial Condition
Operating activities
Cash provided by operating activities was $672.8 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $136.1 million compared with the nine months ended March 25, 2017. This increase was due primarily to an increase of $117.2 million in income before provision for income taxes, which resulted from higher revenue and improved gross margin. 
Investing activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of net investment purchases and maturities and capital expenditures.
Cash used in investing activities increased by $388.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared with the nine months ended March 25, 2017. The increase was due primarily to a $722.0 million increase in purchases of available-for-sale-securities, partially offset by $397.5 million increase in proceeds from maturity of available-for-sale securities during the nine months ended March 31, 2018.
Net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately $84.7 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the nine months ended March 25, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a $250.0 million repayment of notes payable during the nine months ended March 25, 2017 with no repayment for the nine months ended March 31, 2018. This was partially offset by $104.0 million in higher repurchases of our common stock and a $40.2 million increase in dividends paid to stockholders during the nine months ended March 31, 2018.
As of March 31, 2018, our available funds consisted of $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
