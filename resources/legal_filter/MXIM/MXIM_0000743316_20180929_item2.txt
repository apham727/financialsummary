Overview of Business
Net Revenues
Net revenues were $638.5 million and $575.7 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively. Revenue from consumer products was up 13%, primarily driven by higher sales of wearables, smartphones and other consumer products. Revenue from automotive products was up 15%, primarily driven by growth in battery management systems for electric vehicles and auto safety and security products. Revenue from industrial products was also up 12%, primarily driven by higher sales of control and automation products. 
During the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, approximately 89% and 89% of net revenues, respectively, were derived from customers outside of the United States. While less than 1.0% of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate our risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue and results of operations for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017 was immaterial.
Gross Margin 
Our gross margin percentages were 67.4% and 64.9% for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively. Our gross margin increased by 2.5 percentage points, due to improved factory utilization and a reduction in intangible amortization.
Research and development expenses were $112.7 million and $108.6 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively, which represented 17.7% and 18.9% of net revenues for each respective period. The $4.1 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and related expenses.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $81.5 million and $73.7 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively, which represented 12.8% and 12.8% of net revenues for each respective period. The $7.8 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and related expenses.
Severance and Restructuring Expenses
Severance and restructuring expenses were $1.0 million and $5.4 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, respectively, which represented 0.2% and 0.9% of net revenues for each respective period. The $4.4 million decrease was primarily due to the timing of reorganization of certain business units and functions.
In the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $36.2 million and $26.4 million, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 23, 2017 was 15.5% and 14.6%, respectively.
The Act reduced the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in a fiscal year 2018 federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for the Company (average of a 35% rate for the first half of fiscal year 2018 and a 21% rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018). The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 21%.
The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 is 21%. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2018 of 15.5% was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, partially offset by tax expense related to GILTI.
Financial Condition
Operating activities
Cash provided by operating activities was $207.2 million in the three months ended September 29, 2018, a decrease of $12.5 million compared with the three months ended September 23, 2017. This decrease was due primarily to an increase of $23.6 million in accounts receivable and an increase of $12.6 million in other current assets, offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes, which resulted from higher revenue and improved gross margin. 
Investing activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of net investment purchases and maturities and capital expenditures.
Cash provided by investing activities was $97.4 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018, compared with cash used by investing activities of $711.7 million for the three months ended September 23, 2017, a change of $809.1 million. The change was due primarily to purchasing $525.4 million less available-for-sale-securities and an increase of $301.8 million in proceeds from the maturity of available-for-sale securities during the three months ended September 29, 2018 compared to the three months ended September 23, 2017.
Net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately $72.3 million for the three months ended September 29, 2018 compared to the three months ended September 23, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $37.2 million in repurchases of our common stock and a $26.4 million increase in dividends paid to stockholders during the three months ended September 29, 2018.
As of September 29, 2018, our available funds consisted of $2.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements, including the anticipated level of capital expenditures, common stock repurchases, debt repayments and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months.
Current portion of debt
On November 21, 2013, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2.5% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes due on November 15, 2018 (“2018 Notes”). The Company intends and has the ability to pay this debt upon maturity in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Available Borrowing Resources
We have access to a $350 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on June 27, 2019. As of September 29, 2018, we had not borrowed any amounts from this credit facility.
As of September 29, 2018, we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
On July 20, 2017, the board of directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock. The stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors. The Company's prior repurchase authorization was cancelled and superseded by this repurchase authorization.
In the fiscal quarter ended September 29, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of its common stock for approximately $112.5 million. As of September 29, 2018, the Company had remaining authorization of $505.9 million for future share repurchases. The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors, including the price of the Company’s common stock and general market and business conditions.
