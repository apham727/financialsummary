The Company has a 52-to-53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in June. Accordingly, every fifth or sixth fiscal year will be a 53-week fiscal year. Fiscal year 2017 was a 52-week fiscal year and fiscal year 2018 is a 53-week fiscal year. The second quarter of fiscal year 2017 was a 13-week quarter and the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 was a 14-week quarter.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), which is intended to improve accounting for hedging activities by expanding and refining hedge accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and aligning the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements. The Company early-adopted ASU 2017-12 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. There was no material change to the Company's consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption. This adoption was on a prospective basis and therefore had no impact on prior periods.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes the lease accounting requirements in Topic 840. ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a right-of use asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, and for operating leases, the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. The guidance also requires qualitative 
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Scope of Modification Accounting. The amendments in this standard provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The amendments in this standard are effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, with early adoption permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220). This standard provides guidance about the reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. ASU 2018-02 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, with early adoption permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company does not believe the implementation of this standard will result in a material impact to its consolidated financial statements.
Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities consist of contingent consideration liabilities related to an acquisition during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
During the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and the year ended June 24, 2017, there were no transfers in or out of Level 3 from other levels in the fair value hierarchy.
In the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and the year ended June 24, 2017, the Company did not recognize any impairment charges on short-term investments. All available-for-sale investments have maturity dates between April 5, 2018 and March 12, 2021.

The Company designates certain forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 815-Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). As of March 31, 2018 and June 24, 2017, the notional amounts of the forward contracts the Company held to purchase international currencies were $37.3 million and $36.2 million, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts the Company held to sell international currencies were $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively. 
The debt indentures that govern the 2027 Notes, the 2023 Notes and the 2018 Notes, respectively, include covenants that limit the Company's ability to grant liens on its facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, which could limit the Company's ability to secure additional debt funding in the future. In circumstances involving a change of control of the Company followed by a downgrade of the rating of the 2027 Notes, the 2023 Notes or the 2018 Notes, the Company would be required to make an 
offer to repurchase the affected notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
The Company accounts for all the notes above based on their amortized cost. The discount and expenses are being amortized to Interest and other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income over the life of the notes. The interest expense is recorded in Interest and other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Amortized discount and expenses, as well as interest expense associated with the notes, were $12.4 million and $7.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively. Amortized discount and expenses, as well as interest expense associated with the notes, were $37.1 million and $26.3 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively.

The Company has access to a $350 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on June 27, 2019. The facility fee is at a rate per annum that varies based on the Company’s index debt rating and any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at a base rate plus a margin based on the Company’s index debt rating. The credit agreement requires the Company to comply with certain covenants, including a requirement that the Company maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of not more than 3 to 1 and a minimum interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense) greater than 3.5 to 1. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had not borrowed any amounts from this credit facility and was in compliance with all debt covenants.
For the balance of the Company’s financial instruments, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. 
Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options is determined to be the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Options typically vest ratably over a four-year period measured from the date of grant. Options generally expire no later than seven years after the date of grant, subject to earlier termination upon an optionee's cessation of employment or service. 
RSUs granted to employees typically vest over a four-year period and are converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting, subject to the employee's continued service to the Company over that period. RSUs granted after August 2017 will continue to vest post-employment at the Company for certain individuals satisfying specific eligibility requirements. 
The expenses included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for RSUs include expenses related to MSUs of $2.2 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively and $5.8 million and $2.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively.
There were no stock options granted in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017. 
As of March 31, 2018, there was less than $0.1 million of total unrecognized stock compensation cost related to less than 0.1 million unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.3 years.
The fair value of RSUs and other awards under the Company’s 1996 Plan is estimated using the value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company’s common stock prior to vesting. The Company also estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and makes revisions to forfeitures on a quarterly basis. 
The weighted-average fair value of RSUs and other awards granted was $54.81 and $42.30 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively and $44.49 and $37.02 per share for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively. 
The Company withheld shares totaling $9.6 million and $21.2 million in value as a result of employee withholding taxes based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting date for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018. The total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to the taxing authorities are reflected as financing activities within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
As of March 31, 2018, there was $156.4 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to 6.1 million unvested RSUs and other awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.8 years. 
The weighted-average fair value of MSUs granted was $51.03 and $37.29 per share for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, respectively. 
Employees are granted rights to acquire common stock under the 2008 ESPP.
As of March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, there was $3.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively, of unrecognized compensation expense related to the 2008 ESPP.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017 and the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and March 25, 2017, no stock awards were determined to be anti-dilutive and therefore none were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2018 is 28.1%. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, and $4.6 million of discrete excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards, partially offset by $5.1 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits. 
The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to a $236.9 million discrete provisional charge for the Repatriation Tax, a $13.7 million discrete charge to remeasure deferred taxes as of the enactment date of the Act, and $13.1 million of discrete interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates and $8.3 million of discrete excess tax benefits generated by the settlement of share-based awards.

On July 20, 2017, the board of directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of the Company's common stock. The stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors.

The acquired assets included $26.0 million of developed technology and $10.5 million of other intangible assets. The Company also recorded $41.9 million of goodwill in connection with this acquisition. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
The purchase price allocation as of the date of the acquisition reflects various fair value estimates and analysis performed by the Company with the assistance of third-party valuation specialists. The Company may revise its preliminary purchase price allocation during the remainder of the measurement period, which will not exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. 
The Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions, by reporting unit, annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, the Company classified the micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) business line, including associated tangible assets and goodwill, as held for sale but no impairment charge was recorded as the carrying value of the product lines' associated assets approximated or was less than the fair value, less cost to sell. The fair values of the assets were determined after consideration of quoted market prices of similar equipment and offers received. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, the Company completed the sale of this business line for approximately $42.2 million, resulting in a gain of $26.6 million, included in Other operating income (expenses), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
