Overview of Business
Net Revenues
Net revenues were $576.9 million and $622.6 million for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively. Revenue from industrial products are down by 14%, mainly due to a decline in shipments of control and automation products. Revenue from communications and data center products are down by 20%, due to generally lower shipments of server, basestation and data center products. Revenue from automotive products are up by 3%, driven by higher demand for auto powertrain, and auto safety and security products. In addition, the decrease in revenue was partially driven by a one-time incremental $22.0 million of revenue recognized as a result of the sell-in accounting revenue transition during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Also, the decrease in revenue was partially driven by the 13-week second quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to the 14-week second quarter of fiscal year 2018. 
Net revenues were $1,215.4 million and $1,198.3 million for the six months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively. Revenue from automotive products are up by 8%, driven by higher demand for auto powertrain, and auto safety and security products. Revenue from consumer products are up by 7%, driven by an overall higher demand for cell phones, handheld computers, and wearable consumer products. Revenue from communications and data center products are down by 7% due to generally lower shipments of server and basestation products. 
During the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, approximately 89% and 87% of net revenues, respectively, were derived from customers outside of the United States. While less than 1.0% of our sales are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate our risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue and results of operations for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 was immaterial.

Our gross margin percentages were 64.7% and 65.8% for the three months ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively. Our gross margin decreased by 1.1 percentage points, due to higher inventory reserves.

the amount of the Transition Tax. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, the Company completed this work and recorded a discrete $22.1 million measurement period adjustment for the Transition Tax, which increased the Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 29, 2018 by 12.1% and 5.3%, respectively. As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, the accounting for income tax effects of the Act has been completed.
The Act reduced the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in a fiscal year 2018 federal statutory tax rate of 28.1% for the Company (average of a 35% rate for the first half of fiscal year 2018 and a 21% rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018). The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 21%. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company recorded a $13.7 million discrete charge to remeasure deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the enactment date of the Act to reflect the federal statutory tax rate reductions.
The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 21%. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended December 29, 2018 was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to a $22.1 million discrete charge for the Transition Tax, tax generated by the GILTI provisions, and a $4.9 million discrete charge for interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended December 29, 2018 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generated primarily by the Company's international operations managed in Ireland, that were taxed at lower rates, partially offset by a $22.1 million discrete charge for the Transition Tax, tax generated by the GILTI provisions, and a $9.4 million discrete charge for interest accruals for unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company’s federal statutory tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was 28.1%.

Financial Condition
Operating activities
Cash provided by operating activities was $431.4 million in the six months ended December 29, 2018, a decrease of $18.1 million compared with the six months ended December 30, 2017. This decrease was due to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher net income. 
Investing activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of net investment purchases and maturities, and capital expenditures. 
Cash provided by investing activities was $496.5 million for the six months ended December 29, 2018, compared with cash used by investing activities of $731.2 million for the six months ended December 30, 2017, a change of $1,227.6 million. The change was due to lower purchases of and higher proceeds from maturity of available-for-sale securities, in order to provide funds to repay the November 2018 Notes. 
Net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately $731.6 million for the six months ended December 29, 2018 compared to the six months ended December 30, 2017. The increase was due to the repayment of the November 2018 Notes and repurchases of our common stock. 
As of December 29, 2018, our available funds consisted of $2.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements, including the anticipated level of capital expenditures, common stock repurchases, debt repayments and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months.
Available Borrowing Resources
We have access to a $350 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on June 27, 2019. As of December 29, 2018, we had not borrowed any amounts from this credit facility. Effective January 22, 2019, the Company terminated this revolving credit facility. 
As of December 29, 2018, we did not have any material off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
On July 20, 2017, the board of directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock. The stock repurchase authorization did not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity depended on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors. The Company's prior repurchase authorization was cancelled and superseded by this repurchase authorization.
