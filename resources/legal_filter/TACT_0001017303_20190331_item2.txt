Our world-class products are designed from the ground up based on market and customer requirements and are sold under the BOHA!™, AccuDate™, Epic®, EPICENTRAL™, Ithaca®, and Printrex® brand names.
Known and respected worldwide for innovative designs and real-world service reliability, our thermal and inkjet printers and terminals generate top-quality labels, coupons and transaction records such as receipts, tickets and other documents, as well as printed logging and plotting of data.
We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), value-added resellers, select distributors, as well as directly to end-users.
Our product distribution spans across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean Islands and the South Pacific.
We also offer world-class service, support, spare parts, accessories and printing supplies to our growing worldwide base of products currently in use by our customers.

Results of Operations: Three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to three months ended March 31, 2018 



Net Sales.
Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales, as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 *  International sales do not include sales of printers and terminals made to domestic distributors or other domestic customers who may, in turn, ship those printers and terminals to international destinations.
Net sales for the first quarter of 2019 decreased $0.7 million, or 6%, from the same period in 2018.
Printer, terminal and other hardware sales volume decreased 11% to approximately 28,000 units driven primarily by a 27% decrease in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market and a 5% decrease in unit volume in the casino and gaming market.
International sales for the first quarter of 2019 increased $0.5 million, or 23%, from the same period in 2018 primarily due to increased sales in the international casino and gaming market.
Restaurant Solutions.
These terminals help food service establishments and restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick-serve convenience and hospitality establishments) effectively manage food safety and automate and manage back-of-the-house operations.
In addition to sales of terminals, revenue includes sales of cloud-based software applications and hardware (including handheld devices, tablets, temperature probes and temperature sensors).
In 2019, we launched our BOHA!
solution, which combines our latest generation terminal, cloud-based software application and hardware into a unique solution to automate the back-of-house operations in restaurants.
This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our AccuDate XL2e terminal, which has since been rebranded to the BOHA!
terminal.
Additionally, during the first quarter of 2019, we recognized our first sales of BOHA!
software on a SaaS subscription basis.
solution.
POS automation and banking.
Revenue from the POS automation and banking market includes sales of thermal and impact printers used primarily by quick serve restaurants located either at the checkout counter or within self-service kiosks to print receipts for consumers or print on linerless labels.
In addition, revenue includes sales of inkjet printers used by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to print deposit or withdrawal receipts and/or validate checks at bank teller stations.
We expect sales of our Ithaca® 9000 to McDonald’s to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018.
14 



Casino and gaming.
Revenue from the casino and gaming market includes sales of thermal ticket printers used in slot machines, video lottery terminals, and other gaming machines that print tickets or receipts instead of issuing coins at casinos and racetracks and other gaming venues worldwide.
Revenue from this market also includes sales of thermal roll-fed printers used in the international off-premise gaming market in gaming machines such as Amusement with Prizes, Skills with Prizes and Fixed Odds Betting Terminals at non-casino gaming establishments.
In addition, casino and gaming market revenue includes sales of the EPICENTRAL™ print system, our software solution (including annual software maintenance), that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them real-time at the slot machine.
International casino and gaming product sales increased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due to a 77% increase in sales of our thermal casino printers largely to customers in Asia.
This increase was partially offset by a 70% decline in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to Europe, Australia and Asia.
Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
We expect domestic and international casino and gaming sales in 2019 to be relatively consistent with the sales levels achieved during 2018.
Lottery.
Revenue from the lottery market includes sales of thermal on-line and other lottery printers primarily to International Game Technology and its subsidiaries (“IGT”) and, to a lesser extent, other lottery system companies for various lottery applications.
Printrex.
Printrex branded printers are sold into markets that include wide format, desktop and rack mounted and vehicle mounted black/white thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field, seismic and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry.
It also includes high-speed color inkjet desktop printers used to print logs at the data centers of the oil and gas field service companies.
Prior to 2019, revenue in this market also includes sales of vehicle mounted printers used to print schematics and certain other critical information in emergency services vehicles and other mobile printing applications.
15 



TSG.
Revenue generated by our TSG includes sales of consumable products (inkjet cartridges, ribbons, receipt paper, color thermal paper, food safety labels and other printing supplies), replacement parts, maintenance and repair services, technical support services, testing services, refurbished printers, and shipping and handling charges.
Sales of our restaurant solutions labels were five times higher on a growing installed base of AccuDate and BOHA!
terminals.
Service revenue also increased 24% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
Additionally, we had a 18% increase in sales of our legacy HP inkjet cartridges used in our banking printers.
We do not expect this trend to continue for HP inkjet cartridges as we exited the banking market at the end of 2018.
These increases were offset by a 31% decrease in sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to a 102% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers.
Gross Profit.
For the first quarter of 2019, gross profit increased $224 thousand, or 4%, despite a sales decrease of 6% for the first quarter in 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
Our gross margin increased 480 basis points, increasing to 52.7% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 47.9% for the first quarter of 2018.
Such expenses decreased $56 thousand, or 5%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to lower expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
We expect engineering, design and product development expenses in 2019 to be consistent with 2018.
16 



Operating Expenses - Selling and Marketing.
Such expenses increased by $281 thousand, or 18%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher compensation expenses related to the hiring of additional outside and technical sales staff during the latter part of 2018 and first quarter of 2019.
software and hardware solutions.
Operating Expenses - General and Administrative.
General and administrative information for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



General and administrative expenses primarily include salaries, incentive compensation, and other payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resources and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company.
General and administrative expenses increased $78 thousand, or 4%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher professional and legal expenses.
These increases were partially offset by lower recruiting expense and severance expense incurred during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
We expect general and administrative expense to be higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher incentive compensation and additional investment to support restaurant solutions.
Operating Income.
Operating income information for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Our operating income decreased $79 thousand, or 9%, and our operating margin decreased slightly by 30 basis points for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
Interest.
We recorded net interest expense of $6 thousand for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $8 thousand for the first quarter of 2018.
We do not expect significant changes in net interest expense for the full year 2019.
Other, net.
We recorded other income of $90 thousand for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $10 thousand for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in other income was due to higher foreign currency exchange gains recorded by our U.K. subsidiary for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.
Going forward, we may continue to experience more foreign exchange gains or losses depending on the level of sales to Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and the change in exchange rates of the Euro and Pound Sterling against the U.S. dollar.
The FDII deduction was not included in the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 as the interpretive guidance for the deduction was not yet released.
We expect our effective tax rate to be between 13% and 14% for the full year 2019.
17 



Net Income.
We reported net income for the first quarter of 2019 of $746 thousand, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to $680 thousand, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018.
Liquidity and Capital Resources

Credit Facility and Borrowings 



We maintain a credit facility (the "TD Bank Credit Facility") with TD Bank N.A.
(“TD Bank”), which provides for a $20 million revolving credit line.
On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022.
Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all of our assets.
We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line.
The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12.5 million from $10 million.
The TD Bank Credit Facility imposes certain quarterly financial covenants on us and restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the creation of other liens.
We were in compliance with all financial covenants of the TD Bank Credit Facility at March 31, 2019.
The following table lists the financial covenants and the performance measurements at March 31, 2019: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of March 31, 2019, borrowings available under the TD Bank Credit facility were $20 million.
Shareholder Dividend Payments 



In 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the Board’s approval each quarter.
Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017.
Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $0.7 million or $0.09 per share in the first quarter of both 2019 and 2018.
On April 30, 2019 our Board of Directors approved the second quarter 2019 dividend in the amount of $0.09 per share payable on or about June 14, 2019 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on May 20, 2019.
Stock Repurchase Program 



On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”).
The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue the repurchase program prior to such time.
We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account.
Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date.
Resource Sufficiency 



We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our expected cash flows generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our TD Bank Credit Facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, and dividend payments, and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months.
Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe disclosure of payments we have committed to make under our contractual obligations is set forth under Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2018.
We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
Item 2.
UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS       



On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.
As of March 31, 2019, $3 million remains authorized for future repurchase under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.
The following table summarizes the repurchase of our common stock in the three months ended March 31, 2019:
