Revenue 
Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was $168.8 million, an increase of $8.8 million, or 5.5%, from $160.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018. This increase was driven by higher sales in the automotive, industrial, and computing and storage markets. Overall unit shipments increased by 6% due to higher market demand, and average sales prices were essentially flat compared to the same period in 2018. 
For the three months ended September 30, 2019, revenue from the automotive market increased $4.6 million, or 23.5%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment applications. Revenue from the industrial market increased $4.0 million, or 16.1%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source and security products. Revenue from the computing and storage market increased $5.1 million, or 10.8%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by strength in the high-performance notebook market, which was partially offset by lower demand in the solid-state drive storage market. Revenue from the communications market decreased $0.4 million, or 2.0%, from the same period in 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by lower demand for routers and wireless applications, partially offset by higher demand in infrastructure sales including 5G network. Revenue from the consumer market decreased $4.6 million, or 9.4%, from the same period in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in demand for high volume consumer-related products. This decrease was partially offset by higher demand for home appliance products.  
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $461.2 million, an increase of $32.3 million, or 7.5%, from $428.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets except for the consumer market. Overall unit shipments increased by 12% due to higher market demand, and average sales prices decreased by approximately 2% from the same period in 2018. 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, revenue from the communications market increased $12.5 million, or 24.8%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher demand in infrastructure sales including 5G network. Revenue from the industrial market increased $11.1 million, or 18.0%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source and security products. Revenue from the computing and storage market increased $18.0 million, or 15.6%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by strength in the high-performance notebook market, which was partially offset by lower demand in the solid-state drive storage market. Revenue from the automotive market increased $8.3 million, or 14.4%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment applications. Revenue from the consumer market decreased $17.6 million, or 12.3%, from the same period in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in demand for high volume consumer-related products, as well as lower sales from specialty lighting, chargers and gaming products. This decrease was partially offset by higher demand for mobile phone and home appliance products.  
Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin 
Cost of revenue was $75.7 million, or 44.8% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2019, and $71.0 million, or 44.4% of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The $4.7 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 6% increase in overall unit shipments and a 6% increase in the average direct cost of units shipped. The increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by a decrease in inventory write-downs and warranty expenses. 
Gross margin was 55.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared with 55.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of lower margin products, which was partially offset by lower inventory write-downs and warranty expenses as a percentage of revenue. 
Cost of revenue was $206.8 million, or 44.8% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, and $190.8 million, or 44.5% of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The $16.0 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 12% increase in overall unit shipments and a 5% increase in the average direct cost of units shipped.

Litigation Expense 
Litigation expense was $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared with $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018. Litigation expense was $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared with $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Litigation expense for these periods was primarily attributable to an ongoing lawsuit in which we are the plaintiff. 
Interest and Other Income, Net 
Interest and other income, net, was $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared with $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.6 million in income related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments and a decrease of $0.5 million in foreign currency exchange gains. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by a $0.7 million gain from the sale of a parcel of land, net of certain capitalized costs and selling expenses, and an increase of $0.3 million in interest income as a result of higher investment balances and yields. 
Interest and other income, net, was $7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared with $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.7 million in income related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments, a $0.7 million gain from the sale of a parcel of land, net of certain capitalized costs and selling expenses, and an increase of $0.6 million in interest income as a result of higher investment balances and yields. These favorable changes were partially offset by a decrease of $0.9 million in foreign currency exchange gains. 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, our effective tax rates included the estimated impact of $13.0 million and $38.5 million, respectively, related to the GILTI provisions that were included as additional subpart F income, which was accounted for as a period cost. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, our effective tax rates included the estimated impact of $18.4 million and $46.2 million, respectively, related to the GILTI provisions. 
As of September 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $205.2 million and short-term investments of $213.5 million, compared with cash and cash equivalents of $172.7 million and short-term investments of $204.6 million as of December 31, 2018. As of September 30, 2019, $141.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $124.0 million of short-term investments were held by our international subsidiaries. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we repatriated $75 million of cash from our Bermuda subsidiary to the U.S. The proceeds were primarily used to fund real estate purchases and cash dividend payments. We may repatriate additional cash from our Bermuda subsidiary to fund our expenditures in future periods. We anticipate that earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested. 
The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets, reduced by accounts payable, accrued compensation and related benefits, and other accrued liabilities. As of September 30, 2019, we had working capital of $524.3 million, compared with working capital of $500.4 million as of December 31, 2018. The $23.9 million increase in working capital was due to a $48.5 million increase in current assets, which was partially offset by a $24.6 million increase in current liabilities. The increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and other current assets. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, accrued compensation and related benefits and other accrued liabilities. 
Summary of Cash Flows 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $155.3 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net increase of $10.6 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in income tax liabilities was primarily due to income tax payments made for the year, including the annual deemed repatriation transition tax. The increase in other accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan and an increase in operating lease liabilities. For the nine month ended September 30, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $93.9 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $41.9 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by increased sales and the timing of shipments in the last month of the quarter. The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth. The increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet future demand. 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $88.1 million, primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of $87.1 million, which included the purchase of a building and land in Kirkland, Washington for $52.3 million, net purchases of short-term investments of $7.6 million and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of $1.8 million.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $31.0 million, primarily reflecting $48.6 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, which was partially offset by $17.8 million of cash proceeds from the vesting of RSUs and the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.
