This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that have been made pursuant to and in reliance on the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, among others, statements concerning:
      â€¢   the factors that differentiate us from our competitors.    
We operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain products. We are not immune from current and future industry downturns, but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term. 
We work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits ("ICs"). This has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs, while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths. 
We derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in Asia, where our products are incorporated into end-user products. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, our revenue from sales to customers in Asia was 87% and 88%, respectively. We derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our DC to DC converter products which serve the computing and storage, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer markets. We believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new products, enter new market segments, gain market share, manage litigation risk, diversify our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity. 
There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements during the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to those disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $141.4 million, an increase of $12.2 million, or 9.5%, from $129.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets except for the consumer market. Overall unit shipments increased by 13% due to higher market demand, and average sales prices decreased by approximately 2% from the same period in 2018. 
Revenue from the computing and storage market for the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased $8.2 million, or 26.5%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by strength in the high-performance notebook market. Revenue from the automotive market increased $2.8 million, or 15.7%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment, safety and connectivity applications. Revenue from the industrial market increased $3.8 million, or 21.6%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source and security products. Revenue from the communications market increased $6.4 million, or 40.8%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher demand in networking applications. Revenue from the consumer market decreased $9.0 million, or 19.1%, from the same period in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to softness in demand for high volume consumer-related products, particularly those sold in the greater China region, as well as lower sales from chargers and gaming products. This decrease was partially offset by higher demand for home appliance products.  
Cost of revenue was $63.4 million, or 44.8% of revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2019, and $57.7 million, or 44.6% of revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The $5.7 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 13% increase in overall unit shipments and a 6% increase in the average direct cost of units shipped. The increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in warranty expense and a $1.1 million decrease in inventory write-downs. 
Litigation expense was $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared with $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower expenses incurred on an ongoing lawsuit in which we are the plaintiff. 
The income tax provision for interim periods is generally determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate and adjusted for discrete items, if any, in the relevant period. Each quarter the estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if our estimated tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made. 
 For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, our effective tax rate included the estimated impact of $15.5 million and $12.4 million, respectively, related to the GILTI provisions that was included as additional subpart F income, which was accounted for as a period cost. 
As of March 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $181.8 million and short-term investments of $177.3 million, compared with cash and cash equivalents of $172.7 million and short-term investments of $204.6 million as of December 31, 2018. As of March 31, 2019, $114.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $82.2 million of short-term investments were held by our international subsidiaries. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, we repatriated $75 million of cash from our Bermuda subsidiary to the U.S. The proceeds are primarily used to fund our cash dividend payments and real estate purchases. We may repatriate additional cash from our Bermuda subsidiary to fund our future expenditures. Earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested. 
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $38.8 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $4.8 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by timing of shipments in the last month of the quarter and sales to customers with longer payment terms. The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth. The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $16.3 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $23.9 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by timing of shipments in the last month of the quarter. The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth.  
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $0.8 million, primarily reflecting $12.8 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, which was partially offset by $12.0 million of cash proceeds from vesting of RSUs and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $1.0 million, primarily reflecting $9.4 million of cash proceeds from vesting of RSUs and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by $8.3 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs.  
We have a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. In addition, outstanding RSU awards contain rights to receive dividend equivalents, which entitle employees who hold RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. The dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid to the employees when the underlying RSUs vest. Dividend equivalents accumulated on the underlying RSUs are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill their service requirement and the awards do not vest.  
We anticipate that cash used for future dividends and dividend equivalent payments, as well as payments for the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax and other expenditures, will come from our current domestic cash, cash generated from ongoing U.S. operations, and cash repatriated from our Bermuda subsidiary. Earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested. 
Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short-term investments, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.  
Our outstanding purchase commitments primarily consist of wafer purchases, assembly and other manufacturing services, construction services and license arrangements. As of March 31, 2019, the outstanding balance under our purchase commitments was $79.1 million, compared with $61.4 million as of December 31, 2018. 
Other long-term obligations include long-term liabilities reflected on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which primarily consist of the deferred compensation plan liabilities and accrued dividend equivalents. As of March 31, 2019, the outstanding obligations were $42.0 million, compared with $38.5 million as of December 31, 2018. 
Our other contractual obligations have not changed significantly from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
