This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that have been made pursuant to and in reliance on the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, among others, statements concerning:
We work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits ("ICs"). This has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs, while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths. 
Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was $151.0 million, an increase of $11.2 million, or 8.0%, from $139.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets except for the consumer market. Overall unit shipments increased by 16% due to higher market demand, and average sales prices decreased by approximately 5% from the same period in 2018. 
For the three months ended June 30, 2019, revenue from the communications market increased $6.4 million, or 41.4%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher demand in networking applications. Revenue from the industrial market increased $3.3 million, or 17.3%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source and security products. Revenue from the computing and storage market increased $4.6 million, or 12.5%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by strength in the high-performance notebook market, which was partially offset by lower demand in the solid-state drive storage market. Revenue from the automotive market increased $0.9 million, or 4.4%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment applications. Revenue from the consumer market decreased $4.0 million, or 8.4%, from the same period in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to softness in demand for high volume consumer-related products, particularly those sold in the greater China region, as well as lower sales from gaming products. This decrease was partially offset by higher demand for mobile phone products.  
Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $292.4 million, an increase of $23.5 million, or 8.7%, from $268.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets except for the consumer market. Overall unit shipments increased by 15% due to higher market demand, and average sales prices decreased by approximately 3% from the same period in 2018. 
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, revenue from the communications market increased $12.9 million, or 41.1%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher demand in networking applications. Revenue from the industrial market increased $7.1 million, or 19.4%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source and security products. Revenue from the computing and storage market increased $12.9 million, or 18.9%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by strength in the high-performance notebook market, which was partially offset by lower demand in the solid-state drive storage market. Revenue from the automotive market increased $3.7 million, or 9.6%, from the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment applications. Revenue from the consumer market decreased $13.0 million, or 13.7%, from the same period in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to softness in demand for high volume consumer-related products, particularly those sold in the greater China region, as well as lower sales from chargers and gaming products. This decrease was partially offset by higher demand for mobile phone products.  
Cost of revenue was $67.8 million, or 44.9% of revenue, for the three months ended June 30, 2019, and $62.2 million, or 44.5% of revenue, for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The $5.6 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 16% increase in overall unit shipments and a 2% increase in the average direct cost of units shipped. The increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by a decrease in inventory write-downs. 
Gross margin was 55.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared with 55.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of lower margin products, which was partially offset by lower inventory write-downs as a percentage of revenue. 
Cost of revenue was $131.1 million, or 44.9% of revenue, for the six months ended June 30, 2019, and $119.9 million, or 44.6% of revenue, for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The $11.2 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 15% increase in overall unit shipments and a 4% increase in the average direct cost of units shipped. The increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by a decrease in inventory write-downs and warranty expense. 
Gross margin was 55.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared with 55.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of lower margin products, which was partially offset by lower inventory write-downs and warranty expenses as a percentage of revenue. 
Litigation expense was $0.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared with $0.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower expenses incurred on an ongoing lawsuit in which we are the plaintiff. 
Litigation expense was $0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared with $1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower expenses incurred on an ongoing lawsuit in which we are the plaintiff. 
Interest and other income, net, was $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared with $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. For the three months ended June 30, 2019, amortization of premium on available-for-sale investments decreased $0.3 million and income related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments increased $0.2 million, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018. These favorable changes were offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in foreign currency exchange gains. 
The income tax provision for interim periods is generally determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate and adjusted for discrete items, if any, in the relevant period. Each quarter the estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if our estimated tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made. 
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, our effective tax rate included the estimated impact of $10.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, related to the GILTI provisions that was included as additional subpart F income, which was accounted for as a period cost. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, our effective tax rate included the estimated impact of $15.5 million and $27.9 million, respectively, related to the GILTI provisions. 
As of June 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $197.0 million and short-term investments of $169.5 million, compared with cash and cash equivalents of $172.7 million and short-term investments of $204.6 million as of December 31, 2018. As of June 30, 2019, $131.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $81.4 million of short-term investments were held by our international subsidiaries. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, we repatriated $75 million of cash from our Bermuda subsidiary to the U.S. The proceeds were primarily used to fund real estate purchases and cash dividend payments. We may repatriate additional cash from our Bermuda subsidiary to fund our expenditures in future periods. Earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested. 
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $16.7 million, primarily reflecting $30.8 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, which was partially offset by $14.1 million of cash proceeds from vesting of RSUs and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $11.1 million, primarily reflecting $21.5 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, partially offset by $10.3 million of cash proceeds from vesting of RSUs and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.  
We anticipate that cash used for future dividends and dividend equivalent payments, as well as payments for the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax and other expenditures, will come from our current domestic cash, cash generated from ongoing U.S. operations, and cash repatriated from our Bermuda subsidiary. Earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested. 
Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short-term investments, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.  
Our outstanding purchase commitments primarily consist of wafer purchases, assembly and other manufacturing services, construction services and license arrangements. As of June 30, 2019, the outstanding balance under our purchase commitments was $71.4 million, compared with $61.4 million as of December 31, 2018. 
Our long-term obligations include long-term liabilities reflected on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which primarily consist of the deferred compensation plan liabilities and accrued dividend equivalents. As of June 30, 2019, the outstanding obligations were $43.4 million, compared with $38.5 million as of December 31, 2018. 
Our other contractual obligations have not changed significantly from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
As of June 30, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation S-K.
