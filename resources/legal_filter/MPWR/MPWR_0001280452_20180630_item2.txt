Interest and Other Income, Net 
Interest and other income, net, was $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared with $1.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.7 million in foreign currency exchange gain and an increase of $0.2 million in interest income as a result of higher investment balances and yields. 
Interest and other income, net, was $2.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared with $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.4 million in foreign currency exchange gain, an increase of $0.4 million in interest income as a result of higher investment balances and yields, and a decrease of $0.2 million in amortization of premium on available-for-sale investments, which was partially offset by a decrease of $1.0 million in income related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments. 
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, our effective tax rate included the estimated impact of $15.5 million and $27.9 million, respectively, related to the GILTI provisions that was included as additional subpart F income, which was accounted for as a period cost. In addition, during the first quarter of 2018, we paid the 2018 installment of $1.9 million related to the deemed repatriation transition tax liability. As of June 30, 2018, $1.9 million of the remaining transition tax liability was recorded in current accrued liabilities and $20.1 million was recorded in long-term income tax liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
The income tax provision for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 was $1.2 million, or 7.4% of pre-tax income, and $1.7 million, or 5.4% of pre-tax income, respectively. The effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because foreign income generated by our subsidiaries in Bermuda and China was taxed at lower rates. In addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by changes in the valuation allowance primarily related to stock-based compensation. 
As of June 30, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $83.1 million and short-term investments of $230.4 million, compared with cash and cash equivalents of $82.8 million and short-term investments of $216.3 million as of December 31, 2017. As of June 30, 2018, $54.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $125.3 million of short-term investments were held by our international subsidiaries. As a result of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, we currently plan to repatriate cash from our Bermuda subsidiary to fund our future expenditures in the U.S. Earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested. 
The significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets, reduced by accounts payable, accrued compensation and related benefits, and other accrued liabilities. As of June 30, 2018, we had working capital of $434.5 million, compared with working capital of $383.3 million as of December 31, 2017. The $51.2 million increase in working capital was due to a $60.6 million increase in current assets, partially offset by a $9.4 million increase in current liabilities. The increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in short-term investments, accounts receivable and inventories. The increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. 
Summary of Cash Flows 
For the six month ended June 30, 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $41.7 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $41.7 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by increased sales and the timing of shipments in the last month of the quarter. The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth. The increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet future demand. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $46.8 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $17.3 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by higher sales and the timing of shipments. The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die bank inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth. The increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet future demand. The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan. 
For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $29.9 million, primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of $13.0 million, net purchases of short-term investments of $15.9 million, and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of $0.9 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $73.7 million, primarily due to net purchases of short-term investments of $51.6 million, purchases of property and equipment of $20.5 million, and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of $1.6 million.  
For the six months ended June 30, 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $11.1 million, primarily reflecting $21.5 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, partially offset by $10.3 million of cash proceeds from vesting of RSUs and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $15.6 million, primarily reflecting $16.8 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold RSUs, partially offset by $1.5 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. 
In June 2014, our Board of Directors approved a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. In addition, outstanding RSU awards contain rights to receive dividend equivalents, which entitle employees who hold RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. The dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid to the employees when the underlying RSUs vest. Dividend equivalents accumulated on the underlying RSUs are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill their service requirement and the awards do not vest. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling $21.5 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling $16.8 million. 
In February 2018, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividends from $0.20 per share to $0.30 per share, effective for the dividends declared in first quarter of 2018. 
Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short-term investments, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.  
Our outstanding purchase commitments primarily consist of wafer purchases from our foundries, assembly services and license arrangements. As of June 30, 2018, the outstanding balance under our purchase commitments was $74.9 million, compared with $52.6 million as of December 31, 2017. 
Other long-term obligations include long-term liabilities reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which primarily consist of the deferred compensation plan liabilities and accrued dividend equivalents. As of June 30, 2018, the outstanding obligations were $34.9 million, compared with $33.0 million as of December 31, 2017. 
Our other contractual obligations have not changed significantly from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
