 Item 2.
We have operations and office facilities in Hunt Valley, Maryland, Reno, Nevada and San Antonio, Texas.
The Company evaluates its business within two segments: commercial and retail.
The commercial segment consists of the following customer markets: (1) public carriers, that are generally responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure system and provide airtime service to individual subscribers; and (2) value-added resellers and integrators, which results from the consolidation of our previously identified value-added resellers, government channels and private system operator markets, and reflects implementation over the 2019 fiscal year of an enhanced go-to-market strategy.
This go-to-market strategy and the corresponding consolidation of these customer markets is designed to increase sales opportunities across the consolidated markets, as well as to provide better coverage to customers and to better align territories with supplier partners.
The retail segment consists of the retail market which includes retailers, independent dealer agents and carriers.
We offer a wide range of products that are classified into four product categories: base station infrastructure; network systems; installation, test and maintenance; and mobile device accessories.
Base station infrastructure products are used to build, repair and upgrade wireless telecommunication systems.
Sales of traditional base station infrastructure products, such as base station radios, cable and transmission lines and antennas are in part dependent on capital spending in the wireless communications industry.
Network systems products are used to build and upgrade computing and internet networks.
We have also been growing our offering of wireless broadband, distributed antennas systems (DAS), network equipment, security and surveillance products, which are not as dependent on the overall capital spending of the industry.
Installation, test and maintenance products are used to install, tune, and maintain wireless communications equipment.
Mobile device accessories products include cellular phone and data device accessories.
The terms, and accordingly the factors, applicable to each relationship often differ.
Our customer relationships could

 Table of Contents  



also be affected by wireless carrier consolidation or the overall global economic environment.
The wireless communications distribution industry is competitive and fragmented and is comprised of several national distributors.
In addition, many manufacturers sell direct.
Consolidation of larger wireless carriers has and will most likely continue to impact our current and potential customer base.
We believe, however, that our strength in service, the breadth and depth of our product offering, our information technology system, industry experience and knowledge, and our large customer base and purchasing relationships with approximately 400 manufacturers, provide us with a significant competitive advantage over new entrants to the marketplace.
Results of Operations  



 Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2019  



 Total Revenues.
Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased 10.6% compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Revenues in our public carrier market, value-added resellers and integrators market and retail market decreased by 1.3%, 6.1% and 24.1%, respectively.
The decline in the retail segment was driven by significantly lower revenues from one of our more significant retail customers following its acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, change in business model and subsequent transition of its business elsewhere, as well as ongoing overall market softness.
Total Gross Profit.
Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased by 16.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Overall gross profit margin decreased from 19.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to 18.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
Within our commercial segment, gross profit margin in our public carrier market increased from 12.0% to 12.4% due to changes in customer mix.
Gross profit margin in our value-added resellers and integrators market decreased from 24.6% to 23.8%.
Agreements or arrangements on which these relationships are based typically do not include any obligation in respect of any specific product purchase or sale, are of limited duration, and are terminable by either party upon relatively short notice.
Selling, General, Administrative and Restructuring Expenses.
Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $3.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 18.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, to 18.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
These decreases were largely due to the decline in overall revenues.
We continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve based on this evaluation.
We also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective and current customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such customers based on this evaluation.
We had bad debt recovery, net of expense, of $107,900 and bad debt expense of $665,100 for the three months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively.
Interest, Net.
Net interest expense increased from $244,800 for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to $335,100 for the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
Increased focus on business opportunities for sales to our public carrier customers has required us to maintain increased inventory levels, and at times has resulted in increased borrowings and interest expense under our secured Revolving Credit Facility (discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).
We expect this higher level of interest expense to continue for at least the next several quarters.
Income Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share.
The effective tax rate increased from 28.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to 90.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
The increase in the effective tax rate is the result of permanent and other tax adjustments remaining consistent year over year while pre-tax income decreased year over year.
The significant increase in rates is also due to a change in estimated fiscal year pre-tax earnings from the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to the second quarter of fiscal 2020, resulting in a significant adjustment in this quarter’s rate.
Net income decreased 98.2% and diluted earnings per share decreased 100% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the corresponding prior-year quarter.
First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2019  



 Total Revenues.
Revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2019 decreased 12.0% compared with the first six months of fiscal 2019.
Revenues in our public carrier market, value-added resellers and integrators market and retail market decreased by 9.2%, 3.4% and 26.3%, respectively.
The decline in the commercial segment was primarily due to the project-oriented nature of this business.
Several large customers adjusted their forecasts or pushed out their product requirements from the first six months into the remainder of the fiscal year.
The decline in the retail segment was driven by significantly lower revenues from one of our more significant retail customers following its acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, change in business model and subsequent transition of its business elsewhere, as well as ongoing overall market softness.
Total Gross Profit.
Gross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2020 decreased by 16.9% compared to the first six months of fiscal 2019.
Overall gross profit margin decreased from 20.1% in the first six months of fiscal 2019 to 18.9% in the first six months of fiscal 2020.
Agreements or arrangements on which these relationships are based typically do not

include any obligation in respect of any specific product purchase or sale, are of limited duration, and are terminable by either party upon relatively short notice.
Selling, General, Administrative and Restructuring Expenses.
Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $4.6 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020, compared to the first six months of fiscal 2019.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from 18.9% for the first six months of fiscal 2019, to 19.8% for the first six months of fiscal 2020.
These decreases were largely due to the decline in overall revenues.
The Company also incurred a $0.5 million restructuring charge related to severance expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
We continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve based on this evaluation.
We also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective and current customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such customers based on this evaluation.
We incurred bad debt expense, net of recovery, of $27,500 and $1,021,300 for the six months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively.
Interest, Net.
Net interest expense increased from $419,200 for the first six months of fiscal 2019 to $543,800 for the first six months of fiscal 2020.
Increased focus on business opportunities for sales to our public carrier customers has required us to maintain increased inventory levels, and at times has resulted in increased borrowings and interest expense under our secured Revolving Credit Facility (discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).
We expect this higher level of interest expense to continue for at least the next several quarters.
Income Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share.
The effective tax rate decreased from 27.4% for the first six months of fiscal 2019 to 24.9% for the first six months of fiscal 2020.
Net income decreased 205.2% and diluted earnings per share decreased 207.4% for the first six months of fiscal 2020, compared to the first six months of fiscal 2019.
Liquidity and Capital Resources  



 The following table summarizes our cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the six months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Table of Contents  



 We used $14.0 million of net cash from operating activities for the first six months of fiscal 2020, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $3.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2019.
This fiscal 2020 outflow was driven by a net loss and an increase in inventory.
Net cash used in investing activities of $3.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020 increased from cash used of $2.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2019.
Cash used in both periods was due to capital expenditures largely comprised of investments in information technology.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $17.4 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020, compared to $5.5 million provided in the first six months of fiscal 2019.
We utilized our asset based secured Revolving Credit Facility during the first six months of fiscal 2020 and 2019, leading to a cash inflow of $20.9 million and $8.9 million, respectively, during those periods.
We had cash outflows of $3.4 million during the first six months of both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, due to cash dividends paid to shareholders.
On October 19, 2017, the Company and its primary operating subsidiaries, as co-borrowers, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as a lender (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), which amended and restated the terms of a previously established secured Revolving Credit Facility and which resulted in, among other modifications, an increase in the Company’s borrowing limit to up to $75 million, from the previous borrowing limit of up to $35 million.
In addition to increasing the borrowing limit, and among other modifications, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement extended the applicable maturity date to October 19, 2021.
As of September 29, 2019, borrowings under the secured Revolving Credit Facility totaled $35.3 million; therefore, we then had $39.7 million available, subject to the Borrowing Base limitations and compliance with the other applicable terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the financial and other covenants discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement accrue interest at the rates, and the Company is required to pay a monthly commitment fee, as also discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
In connection with the entering into of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company and the other Company affiliate borrowers under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and other subsidiaries, referred to collectively as the Loan Parties, executed and delivered to SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent, a Reaffirmation Agreement, pursuant to which the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Guaranty and Security Agreement previously delivered by the Loan Parties in connection with the secured Revolving Credit Facility as previously existing (including the previously existing guaranty by the Loan Parties not otherwise Borrowers and the previously existing grant by the Company and the other Loan Parties of a continuing first priority security interest in inventory, accounts receivable and deposit accounts, and on all documents, instruments, general intangibles, letter of credit rights, and all proceeds) were ratified and confirmed as respects the Obligations arising from time to time under the secured Revolving Credit Facility provided for pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
We have made quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock since the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
Our most recent quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share was paid in August 2019.
On October 29, 2019, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.20 per share, payable on November 27, 2019 to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2019.
Any future declaration of dividends and the establishment of any corresponding record and payment dates remains subject to further determination from time to time by the Board of Directors.

 We believe that our existing cash, payments from customers and availability under our secured Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to support our operations for at least the next twelve months.
To minimize interest expense, our policy is to apply excess available cash to reduce the balance outstanding from time to time on our secured Revolving Credit Facility.
Our increased focus over the past several quarters on business opportunities for sales to our public carrier customers led to the recent expansion of our secured Revolving Credit Facility, and has at times resulted in increased borrowings and dependence on that facility.
We expect this trend to continue, although at present we have no plans for any further expansion of the facility.
If we were to undertake an acquisition or other major capital purchases that require funds in excess of existing sources of liquidity, we would look to sources of funding from additional credit facilities, debt and/or equity issuances.
As of September 29, 2019, we do not have any material capital expenditure commitments.
