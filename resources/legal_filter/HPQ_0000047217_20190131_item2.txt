•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



•Liquidity and Capital Resources.
An analysis of changes in our cash flows and a discussion of our liquidity and financial condition.
•Contractual and Other Obligations.
An overview of contractual obligations, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan contributions, cost-saving plans, uncertain tax positions and off-balance sheet arrangements of our operations.
OVERVIEW



We are a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies, solutions, and services.
We sell to individual consumers, SMBs and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health, and education sectors.
We have three reportable segments: Personal Systems, Printing and Corporate Investments.
The Personal Systems segment offers Commercial and Consumer desktop and notebook PCs, workstations, thin clients, Commercial mobility devices, retail POS systems, displays and other related accessories, software, support, and services.
The Printing segment provides Consumer and Commercial printer hardware, Supplies, solutions and services, as well as scanning devices.
Corporate Investments include HP Labs and certain business incubation projects.
•In Personal Systems, our strategic focus is on profitable growth through hyper market segmentation with respect to enhanced innovation in multi-operating systems, multi-architecture, geography, customer segments and other key attributes.
Additionally, we are investing in premium form factors such as convertible notebooks to meet customer preference for mobile, thinner and lighter devices.
We have increased our focus on Device as a Service as the market begins to shift to contractual solutions.
We believe that we are well positioned due to our competitive product lineup.
•In Printing, our strategic growth focus is on shift to contractual solutions and Graphics, as well as expanding our footprint in the 3D printing marketplace.
The shift to contractual solutions includes an increased focus on MPS and Instant Ink, supporting our strategy of placing higher value printer units (including our A3 products and solutions) which offer strong annuity of toner and ink.
In the Graphics space, we are focused on innovations such as our Indigo and Latex product offerings, which support accelerated growth in our Graphic solutions.
We continue to execute on our key initiatives of focusing on high-value products targeted at high usage categories and introducing new revenue delivery models.
One set of challenges relates to dynamic market trends, such as forecasted declining PC Client markets and home printing markets.
A second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape.
Our primary competitors are exerting competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others.
A third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution in an evolving distribution and reseller landscape, with increasing omnichannel presence.
•In Personal Systems, we face challenges with industry component availability.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of



Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)



•In Printing, we obtain many components from single sources due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations.
For instance, we source the majority of our A4 and a portion of our A3 portfolio of laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from Canon.
We are also seeing increases in commodity costs impacting our bill of materials.
The impact of these and other global macroeconomic challenges on our business cannot be known at this time.
To address these challenges, we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners.
We also continue to work on optimizing our sales coverage models, align our sales incentives with our strategic goals, improve channel execution, strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, and develop and capitalize on market opportunities.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES



MD&A is based on our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Revenue Recognition



We recognize revenue depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we are expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
We evaluate customers’ ability to pay based on various factors like historical payment experience, financial metrics and customer credit scores.
We enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while many of our sales contracts contain standard terms and conditions, there are contracts which contain non-standard terms and conditions.
Further, many of our arrangements include multiple performance obligations.
As a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including the identification of performance obligations considered to be separate units of accounting, the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations in the arrangement and the timing of transfer of control of promised goods or services for each of those performance obligations.
We evaluate each performance obligation in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting.
A performance obligation constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the performance obligation is distinct within the context of the contract.
Transaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer.
If the transaction price includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount using either the expected value or most likely amount method.
We reduce the transaction price at the time of revenue recognition for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns.
The selling price for each performance obligation is based on its standalone selling price (“SSP”).
We establish SSP using the price charged for a performance obligation when sold 



45

HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of



Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)



separately (“observable price”) and, in some instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority.
When observable price is not available, we establish SSP based on management’s judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life-cycle.
Consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology industry life cycles.
In most arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation at the inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price.
However, the aforementioned factors may result in a different SSP determination applying management judgments and estimates.
This may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement.
Revenue is recognized when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer.
We generally invoice the customer upon delivery of the goods or services and the payments are due as per contract terms.
For fixed price support or maintenance and other service contracts that are in the nature of stand-ready obligations, payments are generally received in advance from customers and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over time for the duration of the contract.
In instances when revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor products or services, we record revenue on a gross basis when we are a principal in the transaction and on a net basis when we are acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor.
In December 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB No.
118, which allows registrants to record provisional amounts during a one year “measurement period”.
As of January 31, 2019, we completed the accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA with no material changes to the provisional amounts recorded during the measurement period.
The guidance indicates that either accounting for deferred taxes related to Global Minimum Tax inclusions or to treat any taxes on Global Minimum Tax inclusions as period cost are both acceptable methods subject to an accounting policy election.
We have elected to treat the Global Minimum Tax inclusion as period costs.
Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the United States and the amounts we expect to distribute to the United States and provide the U.S. federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the United States.
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS



For a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements see Note 1, “Basis of Presentation”, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
The constant currency measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue on a GAAP basis.
Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.
Results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Net Revenue



For the three months ended January 31, 2019, total net revenue increased 1% (increased 2% on a constant currency basis) as compared to the prior-year period.
U.S. net revenue decreased 2% to $4.9 billion, while net revenue from international operations increased 3% to $9.8 billion.
A detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment net revenue is included in “Segment Information” below.
A detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment gross margins is included under “Segment Information” below.
Operating Expenses



Research and Development (“R&D”)



R&D expense remained flat for the three months ended January 31, 2019, as compared to the prior-year period, and relate to continuing investments in Printing and Personal Systems.
Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”)



SG&A expense increased 1.5% for the three months ended January 31, 2019, as compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by investment in digital infrastructure, partially offset by operating expense management.
Restructuring and other Charges



Restructuring and other charges for the three months ended January 31, 2019 relate primarily to the Fiscal 2017 Plan.
47

HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of



Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)



Acquisition-related charges



Acquisition-related charges for the three months ended January 31, 2019 relate primarily to third-party professional and legal fees, and integration-related costs.
Amortization of Intangible Assets



Amortization of intangible assets for the three months ended January 31, 2019 relates primarily to intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of Samsung’s printer business and the Apogee group.
Interest and Other, Net



Interest and other, net expense increased by $18 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019, as compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by lower market-related retirement credits, partially offset by lower interest expense due to reduction of debt in March 2018.
(Provision for) Benefit from Taxes



Our effective tax rate was 10.8% and (114.1%) for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
During the three months ended January 31, 2019, we recorded $9 million of net tax benefits related to discrete items in the provision for taxes.
As discussed in the Note 5, we have completed our analysis of the full impact of TCJA.
These benefits were partially offset by uncertain tax position charges of $20 million and other tax charges of $4 million.
During the three months ended January 31, 2018, we recorded $1.1 billion of net tax benefits related to discrete items in the provision for taxes.
As of January 31, 2018, we had not yet completed our analysis of the full impact of TCJA however we recorded a provisional tax benefit of $1.1 billion related to $5.5 billion net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings, partially offset by $3.2 billion net expense for the repatriation tax payable in installments over eight years and $1.2 billion net expense for remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities for the revaluation of our deferred assets and liabilities to the new US rate of 21%.
This amount also included tax benefits related to audit settlements, acquisition charges and other tax benefits of $32 million, $18 million and $12 million, respectively, offset by uncertain tax position charges of $43 million.
Segment Information



A description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 2, “Segment Information” to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the segments disclosed.
Realignment



 Effective at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we implemented an organizational change to align our business unit financial reporting more closely with our current business structure.
The organizational change resulted in the transfer of certain Samsung-branded product categories from Commercial to Consumer within the Printing segment.
We reflected this change to our business unit information in prior reporting periods on an as-if basis.
The reporting change had no impact to previously reported segment net revenue, consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or net EPS.
Personal Systems

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of



Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)



The components of net revenue and the weighted net revenue change by business unit were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Three months ended January 31, 2019 compared with three months ended January 31, 2018



Personal Systems net revenue increased 2.3% (increased 3.5% on a constant currency basis) for the three months ended January 31, 2019 as compared to the prior-year period.
The net revenue increase was driven by a 5.5% increase in ASPs, partially offset by a 3.0% decrease in unit volume, as compared to the prior-year period.
The increase in ASPs was due to positive mix shifts and higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts.
The decrease in unit volume was primarily due to decline in Desktops.
Consumer and Commercial revenue increased 1.3% and 2.8%, respectively, for the three months ended January 31, 2019 as compared to the prior-year period, driven by growth in Notebooks, primarily as a result of higher ASPs.
Net revenue decreased 3.3% in Desktops and increased 5.8% in Notebooks and 3.5% in Workstations as compared to the prior-year period.
Personal Systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.7 percentage points for the three months ended January 31, 2019 as compared to the prior-year period.
The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher ASPs, partially offset by an increase in commodity and logistics costs.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased primarily due to operating expense management.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of



Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)



Three months ended January 31, 2019 compared with three months ended January 31, 2018



Printing net revenue decreased 0.4% (decreased 0.7% on a constant currency basis) for the three months ended January 31, 2019 as compared to the prior-year period.
The decline in net revenue was primarily driven by Supplies, partially offset by an increase in hardware, services and solutions revenue, and favorable foreign currency impacts.
Net revenue for Supplies decreased 2.5% as compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to demand weakness.
Printer unit volume increased 2.6% while ASPs decreased 2.7% as compared to the prior-year period.
The increase in printer unit volume was primarily driven by unit increases in Consumer and Commercial Hardware.
Printer ASPs decreased primarily due to higher discounting.
Net revenue for Commercial Hardware increased by 5.1% as compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to the acquisition of the Apogee group including services and solutions.
Net revenue for Consumer Hardware increased 1.6% as compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to a 2.4% increase in printer unit volume partially offset by 1.2% decrease in ASPs.
The unit volume increase was primarily driven by the LaserJet Home business.
The decrease in ASPs was primarily driven by mix shift to low-end printers.
Printing earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.5 percentage points for the three months ended January 31, 2019 as compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by decline in gross margin.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased primarily due to operating expense management.
Corporate Investments



The loss from operations in Corporate Investments for the three months ended January 31, 2019 was primarily due to expenses associated with our incubation projects.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



We use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity.
We are able to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, with broad access to capital markets and credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions.
We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed.
Our cash position remains strong, and we expect that our cash balances, anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected near-term cash outlays.
Amounts held outside of the United States are generally utilized to support non-U.S. liquidity needs and may from time to time be distributed to the United States.
The payments associated with this one-time transition tax will be paid over eight years beginning in the current fiscal year.
As we evaluate the future cash needs of our operations, we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries and how to utilize such funds, including reducing our gross debt level, or other uses.
Liquidity



Our key cash flow metrics were as follows:

HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of



Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Operating Activities



Compared to the corresponding period in fiscal year 2018, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $134 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019, primarily due to working capital management activities.
Working Capital Metrics



Management utilizes current cash conversion cycle information to manage HP’s working capital levels.
Our working capital metrics and cash conversion cycle impacts were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



January 31, 2019 as compared to January 31, 2018



The cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO.
DSO measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding.
DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average net revenue.
The increase in DSO was primarily due to unfavorable revenue linearity.
DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average cost of revenue.
The decrease in DOS was primarily due to reduction in inventory driven by reclassification of certain balances to other current assets, pursuant to adoption of the new revenue standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
DPO measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding.
DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average cost of revenue.
The increase in DPO was primarily due to higher inventory purchasing volume and negotiated vendor payments.
Investing Activities



Compared to the corresponding period in fiscal year 2018, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $1.4 billion for the three months ended January 31, 2019, primarily due to lower net payments for acquisitions of $0.6 billion, a decrease in collateral related to our derivatives of $0.5 billion and investments classified as available-for-sale investments within Other current assets by $0.4 billion.
Financing Activities



Compared to the corresponding period in fiscal year 2018, net cash used in financing activities increased by $1.5 billion for the three months ended January 31, 2019, primarily due to lower outstanding commercial paper of $0.9 billion, payment of debt of $0.4 billion and a higher share repurchase settlement amount of $0.3 billion.
Capital Resources



Debt Levels



51

HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of



Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)



We maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital and targeted capital structure.
Outstanding borrowings decreased to $5.0 billion as of January 31, 2019 as compared to $6.0 billion as of October 31, 2018, bearing weighted-average interest rates of 4.7% and 4.3% for January 31, 2019 and October 31, 2018, respectively.
Our weighted-average interest rate reflects the average effective rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the impact of interest rate swaps.
For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 8, “Financial Instruments”, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
As of January 31, 2019, we maintain a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of $4.0 billion, which will be available until March 30, 2023 and is primarily to support the issuance of commercial paper.
Funds borrowed under this revolving credit facility may also be used for general corporate purposes.
Available Borrowing Resources



We had the following resources available to obtain short or long-term financing in addition to the commercial paper and revolving credit facilities discussed above:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For more information on our borrowings, see Note 9, “Borrowings”, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Credit Ratings



Our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them.
We can access alternative sources of funding, including drawdowns under our credit facilities, if necessary, to offset potential reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper.
CONTRACTUAL AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS



Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Contributions



As of January 31, 2019, we anticipate making contributions for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 of approximately $35 million to our non-U.S. pension plans, $26 million to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified pension plan participants and $4 million to cover benefit claims for our post-retirement benefit plans.
Our policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government, funding and taxing authorities.
For more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 4, “Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans”, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Cost Savings Plan



We expect to make future cash payments of approximately $240 million in connection with our cost savings plans.
For more information on our restructuring activities that are part of our cost improvements, see Note 3, “Restructuring and Other Charges”, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Uncertain Tax Positions 



As of January 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.4 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions.
Payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities.
For more information on our uncertain tax positions, see Note 5, “Taxes on Earnings”, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
We expect the actual cash payments for the tax to be much lower as we expect to reduce the overall liability by more than half once existing and future credits and other balance sheet attributes are used.
The payments associated with this one-time transition tax will be paid over eight years beginning in the current fiscal year.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
We have third-party short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers.
For more information on our third-party short-term financing arrangements, see Note 6, “Supplementary Financial Information”, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
