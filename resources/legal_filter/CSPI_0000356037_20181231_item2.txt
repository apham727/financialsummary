Discontinued Operations

The one time gain recorded due to the sale of all the stock of Modcomp GmbH was approximately $16.8 million.

Overview of the three months ended December 31, 2018 



Our revenues increased by approximately $2.4 million, or 14%, to $19.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $16.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.
The increase in overall revenue for the three month period ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the prior fiscal year three month period was substantially the result of an approximately $2.8 million increase in our TS segment revenue, partially offset by an approximately $0.4 million decrease in our HPP segment revenue.
The HPP segment revenue for the three month period ended December 31, 2018 was primarily impacted by lower royalties recognized by approximately $0.5 million on high-speed processing boards during the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the three month period ended December 31, 2017.
Our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 23% of revenue for the three month period ended December 31, 2018 from 26% of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017.
Our operating income decreased by approximately $150 thousand resulting in operating income of $15 thousand for the three month period ended December 31, 2018 as compared to operating income of $165 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of increased selling and marketing expenses and increased engineering expenses for the three month period ended December 31, 2018.
Our income tax expense decreased by approximately $1.2 million to an income tax expense of $2 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2018.
The decrease to the income tax expense was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017.
The following table details our results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of sales for the three months ended:

The decrease in HPP services revenues of $0.6 million for the period was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately $0.5 million in royalty revenues on high-speed processing boards related to the E2D program during the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The increase in TS segment product revenues of $1.9 million during the period was primarily the result of an increase in product revenues of $2.7 million in our U.S. division, partially offset by a decrease in product revenues of $0.8 million in our U.K division.
The $2.7 million increase in the U.S. division product revenues was primarily the result of several completed large product orders and the $0.8 million decrease in the U.K. was due to the reduction of sales from one major customer.
The increase in TS segment service revenues of $0.9 million during the period was primarily the result of an increase in service revenue of $1.0 million in our U.S. division, comprised of a $0.4 million increase in third party service revenues, a $0.3 million increase in third party maintenance revenues, and a $0.2 million increase in managed service contract revenues.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The overall HPP segment gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 48% for the period from 59% in the same prior year period.
The 1% decrease of gross margin as a percentage of the TS segment services sales is the result of decreased service margins in our U.S. division related to the mix of services provided.
Engineering and Development Expenses



Engineering and development expenses increased by $47 thousand to $745 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $698 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2017.

The increased engineering and development expenses for the three month period ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the three month period ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributed to an increase in engineering headcount related expenses.

Other Income/Expenses



The following table details other income (expense) for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The increase to other income (expenses) for the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by the net change of approximately $75 thousand in the foreign exchange gain (loss) on foreign currency holdings combined with an increase in interest income of approximately $51 thousand, partially offset by a decrease in other income of approximately $73 thousand.
Income Taxes



Income tax expense was $2 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to income tax expense of $1.1 million in the same period of 2017 due primary to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
The income tax expense for quarter ended December 31, 2018 was due to the FIN 48 tax expense.
The U.K. did not have any tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 due to the utilization of a portion of its net tax operating loss.
The income tax provision for the current period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the prior year, changes in pretax income over many jurisdictions, and the impact of discrete items.

Liquidity and Capital Resources



Our primary source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents, which decreased by $4.5 million to $20.7 million as of December 31, 2018 from $25.1 million as of September 30, 2018.
Our significant sources of cash for the three months ended December 31, 2018 included a decrease in inventories of $0.6 million, and a decrease in officer's life insurance receivable of $0.3 million.
Our significant uses of cash for the three months ended December 31, 2018 included an increase in accounts receivable of $4.1 million, an increase in other current assets of $0.7 million, and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.3 million.
Cash held by our foreign subsidiary in the United Kingdom totaled approximately $9.0 million as of December 31, 2018 as compared to $9.9 million as of September 30, 2018.
This cash is included in our total cash and cash equivalents reported above.
If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy working capital requirements, we may need to access funds through bank loans, the equity markets, or other means.
Based on our current plans and business conditions, management believes that the Company’s available cash and cash equivalents, the cash generated from the sale of our German operations, the cash generated from operations and availability on our lines of credit will be sufficient to provide for the Company’s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.
