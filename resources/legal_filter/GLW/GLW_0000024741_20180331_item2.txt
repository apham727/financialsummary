 Key Balance Sheet Data

 Credit Rating  
 Management Assessment of Liquidity  
 To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements. We are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of $550 million of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt. Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate.   
 Corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $2 billion. Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company’s $2 billion revolving credit facility is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed. At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper.
