In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value. The Framework outlined our leadership priorities and articulated the opportunities we saw across our businesses. We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength. Under the Framework, we targeted generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth. As of June 30, 2019, Corning met its goal of returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and is on track to invest $11 billion for growth and extended leadership.
On June 14, 2019, Corning introduced its 2020-2023 Strategy and Growth Framework. From 2020 to 2023, the company plans to invest $10 billion to $12 billion for growth and to return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders.
Life Sciences net sales increased by $25 million, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.
Life Sciences net sales increased by $51 million, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.
Lower segment net income of $33 million, $41 million and $24 million for the Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments, respectively.
The decreases in net income outlined above were slightly offset by higher net income for the Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments of $19 million and $11 million, respectively.
Higher translation losses on Japanese yen-denominated debt of $30 million.
Diluted earnings per share increased by $0.21 per share when compared to the same period in 2018, driven by the increase in net income described above, coupled with the repurchase of 34.7 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018. 
Life Sciences net sales increased by $25 million, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.
Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2019, when compared to the prior year.
Life Sciences net sales increased by $51 million, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.
Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, when compared to the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of sales by 2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $11 million, or 5%, and $25 million, or 3%, respectively, when compared to the same periods last year, driven by higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses. As a percentage of sales, these expenses were similar when compared to the same periods last year. 
In the third quarter ending September 30, 2019, equity in earnings of affiliated companies declined by $9 million primarily driven by lower sales volumes for some of our affiliates.
The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current quarter, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated income before income taxes in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018.
For the three months ended September 30, 2019 comprehensive income decreased by $444 million when compared to the same period in 2018, due to lower net income of $288 million and $110 million of negative impacts from the change in foreign currency translation losses, driven primarily by the Korean won. 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 comprehensive income increased by $71 million when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in net income of $154 million offset by $53 million related to the adoption of the new standard for reclassification of stranded tax effects in AOCI.
Refer to Note 13 (Shareholders’ Equity) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Effective July 1, 2019, we have replaced the term “Core Earnings” with “Core Net Income”. The terms are interchangeable and the underlying calculations remain the same.
For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures”.
For the three months ended September 30, 2019, we generated core net income of $397 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to core net income generated in the three months ended September 30, 2018 of $476 million, or $0.51 per share. The decrease of $79 million was due to lower net income across the Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments, partially offset by higher net income for the Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we generated core net income of $1,172 million, or $1.30 per share, compared to core net income generated in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $1,134 million, or $1.20 per share. The increase of $38 million was due to increased core net income across most reportable segments. 
Included in core net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 is net periodic pension expense in the amounts of $22 million and $64 million, respectively, and $13 million and $38 million respectively. 
Display Technologies – manufactures glass substrates primarily for flat panel displays.
Optical Communications – manufactures carrier and enterprise network components for the telecommunications industry.

Environmental Technologies – manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel emission control applications. 
Life Sciences – manufactures glass and plastic labware, equipment, media and reagents enabling workflow solutions for scientific applications.
All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.” This group is primarily comprised of the results of the pharmaceutical technologies business, auto glass, new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates. 
Net sales in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $59 million in the three months ended September 30, 2019, driven by volume decreases and display glass price declines in the low single-digits. Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $82 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, with the increase in glass volume in the high-single digits in percentage terms more than offsetting moderate price declines. 
Net income in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $33 million and increased by $11 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, driven by the changes in sales outlined above. 
For the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect our volume to be down mid-single digits sequentially. Fourth-quarter display glass prices are expected to decline slightly from the third quarter. We expect full-year pricing to be down low-single digits year-over-year.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, net sales increased $135 million, or 4%, primarily due to increased sales of enterprise network products of $152 million offset by lower sales of $17 million for carrier products. The acquisition of CMD, which took place during June of 2018, contributed to year-over-year sales growth.
Net income decreased by $41 million, or 24%, and remained flat, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily driven by the changes in sales, outlined above.
In the fourth quarter, Optical Communications sales are expected to decrease approximately 25 percent year-over-year. We expect full-year sales to decline 3 to 5 percent.
Net sales in the Specialty Materials segment increased by $4 million, or 1%, and $61 million, or 6%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. Increased sales of Gorilla Glass and Advanced Optics products drove the increase for the first half of 2019. However, third quarter shipments of Gorilla Glass in China were lower due to the current trade environment and sales of Advanced Optics products were down due to semiconductor market weakness. 
Net income decreased by $24 million, or 21%, and $18 million, or 8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, impacted by the sales drivers outlined above.
The company expects full-year sales growth, despite a maturing smartphone market. For the fourth-quarter, sales are expected to be consistent year over year.
Net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment increased $66 million, or 20%, and $155 million, or 16%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. Automotive product sales increased $70 million and $125 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, due to continued sales growth of gasoline particulate filters. Diesel product sales decreased $4 million and increased $30 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. 
Net income increased by $19 million, or 32%, and $33 million, or 20%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, primarily driven by increases in sales outlined above. 
This strong performance is expected to continue in the fourth quarter, with sales growth up by a low-teen percentage year over year, leading to full-year sales growth expectations of a mid-teen percentage.
Net sales in the Life Sciences segment increased by $25 million, or 11%, and $51 million, or 7%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, as volume grew faster than the underlying market.
Net income increased by $11 million, or 37%, and $24 million, or 27%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. The increase was driven by the sales increase outlined above and improved manufacturing efficiencies. 
Fourth-quarter and full-year sales are expected to grow mid-single digits year over year. 
Net sales of this segment decreased by $2 million, or 4%, and increased by $4 million, or 3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same periods in 2018, driven primarily by sales changes in our emerging businesses. Net loss decreased by $2 million, or 3%, and $14 million, or 6%, primarily driven by lower spending on development projects when compared to the same periods in 2018.
The proceeds from the Notes were received in Japanese yen and converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance. The net proceeds received in U.S. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, were approximately $349 million and will be used for general corporate purposes. Payments of principal and interest on the Notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a U.S. dollar equivalent. 
In the third quarter of 2018, Corning amended and restated its revolving credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”). The Revolving Credit Agreement provides a $1.5 billion unsecured multi-currency line of credit and expires August 15, 2023. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which Corning must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant. The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%. 
In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 10.8 and 23.4 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $308 million and $703 million, respectively, as part of its 2018 Repurchase Program.
In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 11.8 million and 63.4 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $384 million and $1.9 billion, respectively, as part of its 2016 and 2018 Repurchase Programs. 
Capital spending totaled $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. We expect our 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.0 billion.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $965 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019, when compared to the same period in the prior year. The change was primarily driven by fewer customer deposits and incentives received of $689 million, and a larger increase in working capital as compared to the same period in 2018. 
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $732 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by last year’s acquisition of substantially all of CMD for approximately $800 million.
We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our funding policy is to contribute, over time, an amount exceeding the minimum requirements to achieve the Company’s long-term funding targets. During 2019, we do not expect to make cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan but do expect to contribute $31 million to our international pension plans.
Corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.5 billion. Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company’s Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed. Corning had no outstanding commercial paper at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 
Our Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant. The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%. At September 30, 2019, our leverage using this measure was approximately 33%. As of September 30, 2019, we were in compliance and no amounts were outstanding.
Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument. As of September 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all such provisions.
There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the contractual obligations disclosed in our 2018 Form 10-K under the caption “Contractual Obligations.”
We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. We review our long-lived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.
Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium. These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process and have a very long useful life. Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets. This review considers all the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity. Precious metals are only acquired to support our manufacturing operations and are not held for trading or other purposes.
Refer to Note 1 (Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements.
Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (“the Agency”) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Corning had accrued approximately $39 million and $30 million, respectively, for the undiscounted estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.
currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, new Taiwan dollar, euro, Chinese yuan and South Korean won;
