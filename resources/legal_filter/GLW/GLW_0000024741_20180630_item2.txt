 Summary of results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018  
 Net sales in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $2,747 million and $5,247 million, compared to $2,497 million and $4,872 million, respectively, in the same periods in 2017, driven by an increase in net sales in all segments. The increase in both periods was led by the Optical Communications segment, which increased $141 million and $209 million, respectively, due to higher sales of carrier network products in North American and Europe, and an increase in sales of enterprise network products from growth in data centers. Environmental Technologies segment sales increased $54 million and $101 million, respectively, driven by higher sales of all products. Life Sciences sales increased by $24 million and $46 million, respectively, driven by higher sales across all product lines. Net sales in the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments increased by $3 million and $6 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2018.

 Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies  
 In the first half of 2018, equity in earnings of affiliated companies decreased by $47 million, driven largely by the absence of a $46 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2017 resulting from the modification of long-term sales agreements with a customer of HSG.

 Display Technologies  
 Net income in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $34 million and $94 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. Increased manufacturing costs of $33 million and $45 million, respectively, driven by the impact of the start-up of our facility in Hefei, China were the primary driver of the decrease for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. Additionally, for the six months ended June 30, 2018, the glass price declines described above contributed to the decrease and were partially offset by increases in volume.

 Optical Communications  
 Net sales in the Optical Communications segment increased by $141 million, or 16%, and $209 million, or 12%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. Higher sales of carrier products, up $96 million and $145 million, and enterprise network products, up $45 million and $64 million, respectively, drove the increase. Strong growth in the North American and European fiber-to-the-home and access markets drove the increase in carrier network products, and an increase in data centers drove the increase in enterprise network sales.  
 Net income increased by $22 million, or 17%, and $21 million, or 9%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase was driven by the change in sales outlined above. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, volume gains were partially offset by costs associated with our planned capacity expansions.

 Financing and Capital Resources  
 In the second quarter of 2018, Corning issued ¥65.5 billion Japanese yen-denominated debt securities in tranches of 7, 10 and 12 years. The proceeds from these notes were received in Japanese yen and immediately converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance. The net proceeds received in U.S. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, was $596 million. Payments of principal and interest on the notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a U.S. dollar equivalent.   
 There were no significant items that impacted Corning’s financing structure in the six months ended June 30, 2017.  
 On April 26, 2018, Corning’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share of common stock to be paid on June 29, 2018 to all shareholders of record as of May 31, 2018.   
 Share Repurchase Program  
 During 2017, Corning repurchased 84.4 million shares for approximately $2.4 billion through accelerated share repurchase agreements and open market repurchases under the 2016 Repurchase Program.  
 In the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 24.6 million and 51.6 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $674 million and $1,488 million, respectively, as part of its 2016 Repurchase Program.   
 Capital Spending  
 Cash Flow   
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $564 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period last year, driven by customer deposits received of $576 million and the positive impact of changes in working capital of $215 million. A $62 million decline in dividends received from affiliated companies and non-cash adjustments partially offset these cash inflows.  
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by $1,121 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period last year, driven by the cash outflow of $794 million for the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, an increase of $416 million in capital expenditures largely due to capacity expansion projects in our Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Environmental Technologies segments and a decrease of $113 million in realized gains on translated earnings contracts. Cash received of $196 million, which represents the original fair value of the contingent consideration asset related to the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials (see Note 13), partially offset the net cash used in investing activities.  
 Net cash used in financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased by $440 million when compared to the same period last year, driven by an increase of $438 million in share repurchases, debt repayments of $375 million and a decrease of $209 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $596 million partially offset the negative cash impact of these items.

Key Balance Sheet Data  
   (1)    Includes trade payables only. 
 Credit Rating  
 Management Assessment of Liquidity  
 To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements. We are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of $850 million of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt. Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate.   
 Corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $2 billion. Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company’s $2 billion revolving credit facility is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper.
