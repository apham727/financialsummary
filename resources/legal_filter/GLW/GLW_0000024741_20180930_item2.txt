 Summary of results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018  
 Net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $3.0 billion and $8.3 billion, compared to $2.6 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, for the same periods in 2017, driven by an increase in net sales in all segments. The increase in both periods was led by the Optical Communications segment, which increased $200 million and $409 million, respectively, due to higher sales of carrier network products in North America and Europe, an increase in sales of enterprise network products from growth in data centers and sales from 3M’s Communications Market Division which we acquired in June. Net sales in the Display Technologies segment increased by $57 million and $23 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, with volumes exceeding the display glass market’s strong growth and more than offsetting price declines. The Specialty Materials segment net sales increased by $86 million and $70 million, respectively, resulting from strong demand for Gorilla Glass products in support of new product releases.  Net sales for Environmental Technologies increased $54 million and $155 million, respectively, driven by growth in all product categories. Life Sciences sales increased by $8 million and $54 million, respectively, driven by higher sales across all product lines.

 In the third quarter ending September 30, 2018, equity in earnings of affiliated companies remain relatively consistent with the prior year.  
 In the first three quarters of 2018, equity in earnings of affiliated companies decreased by $46 million, driven by the absence of a $46 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2017 resulting from the modification of long-term sales agreements with a customer of HSG.

 Comprehensive Income   
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 comprehensive income decreased by $965 million when compared to the same period in 2017, due to the negative impact of the change in foreign currency translation adjustments of $749 million, driven primarily by the devaluation of the Japanese yen and the Korean won, a $141 million decrease in net income and a decrease of $38 million in unrealized gains on designated hedges.

 Net income in the Display Technologies segment increased by $7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, for the reasons outlined in the above paragraph. Net income decreased by $87 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 driven by expansion costs and price declines more than offsetting increases in glass volume.

 Life Sciences  
 Net income increased by $5 million, or 20%, and $17 million, or 24%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, driven by the increase in sales described above and improved manufacturing efficiencies. Movements in foreign exchange rates were not material when compared to the corresponding three-month and nine-month periods in 2017.   
 All Other  
 Net sales of this segment increased by $5 million, or 10%, and $23 million, 17%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, when compared to the same period in 2017, driven primarily by an increase in sales in our emerging businesses. The increase in the net loss of $8 million, or 13%, and $38 million, or 20%, reflects increased spending in our development projects when compared to the corresponding three and nine months ended September 30, 2017.  
 Financing and Capital Resources  
 In the second quarter of 2018, Corning issued ¥65.5 billion Japanese yen-denominated debt securities in tranches of 7, 10 and 12 years. The proceeds from these notes were received in Japanese yen and immediately converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance. The net proceeds received in U.S. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, was $596 million. Payments of principal and interest on the notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a U.S. dollar equivalent.

In the third quarter of 2018, Corning amended and restated its revolving credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”). The Revolving Credit Agreement provides a $1.5 billion unsecured multi-currency line of credit and expires August 15, 2023. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which Corning must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant. The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%.   
 There were no significant items that impacted Corning’s financing structure in the nine months ended September 30, 2017.  
 Share Repurchase Program  
 During 2017, Corning repurchased 84.4 million shares for approximately $2.4 billion through accelerated share repurchase agreements and open market repurchases under the 2016 Repurchase Program.  
 On April 26, 2018, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $2 billion share repurchase program with no expiration (the “2018 Repurchase Program”). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 11.8 million and 63.4 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $384 million and $1.9 billion, respectively, as part of its 2016 and 2018 Repurchase Programs.   
 Capital Spending  
 Cash Flow   
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $862 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by customer deposits received of $691 million and the positive impact of changes in working capital of $214 million.   
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by $1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 when compared to the same period last year, driven by the cash outflow of $794 million for the acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, an increase of $382 million in capital expenditures largely due to capacity expansion projects in our Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Environmental Technologies segments and a decrease of $137 million in realized gains on translated earnings contracts. Cash received of $196 million, which represents the original fair value of the contingent consideration asset related to the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials (see Note 13), partially offset the net cash used in investing activities.  
 Net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased by $521 million when compared to the same period last year, driven by an increase in debt repayments of $375 million and decreases of $201 million and $106 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of debt, respectively. A decrease of $184 million in share repurchases partially offset the negative cash impact of these items.

Key Balance Sheet Data

 Credit Rating  
 Management Assessment of Liquidity  
 To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements. We are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of $550 million of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt. Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate. In addition, the company has entered into $300 million of treasury lock agreements to economically fix the benchmark interest rate associated with future debt issuances. This hedge is designated as a cash flow hedge.   
 Corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.5 billion. Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company’s Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper.
