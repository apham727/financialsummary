 Cash Flow   
 Net cash used by operating activities increased by $349 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in the prior year.

 Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $161 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by lower capital expenditures of $131 million.  
 Net cash used in financing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2019 decreased by $566 million when compared to the same period last year, driven primarily by a decrease of $543 million in share repurchases.
