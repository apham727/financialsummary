4.New Accounting Pronouncements



Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2018



In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, (“ASU 2016-09”), which changes certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 effective as of September 1, 2017.
As such, cash flows from operations for the six months ended February 28, 2017 increased $18.4 million, with a corresponding decrease to cash flows from financing activities, compared to amounts previously reported.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
The Company adopted ASU 2018-02 effective as of the beginning of the current reporting period and recorded a reclassification for the stranded tax effects resulting from the TCJA from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Retained earnings in the amount of $11.1 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
Accounting Standards Yet to Be Adopted



In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-07, Compensation — Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”), which will change the presentation of net periodic benefit cost related to employer sponsored defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits.
Additionally, only service costs may be capitalized in assets.
ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2017.

ACUITY BRANDS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)



In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business (“ASU 2017-01”), which requires an evaluation of whether substantially all of the fair value of assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets.
If so, the transaction does not qualify as a business.
The guidance also requires an acquired business to include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs.
ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2017.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2017-01 and intends to implement the standard as required in fiscal 2019.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (“ASU 2016-15”), which is intended to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows including debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance.
ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2017.
The Company intends to implement the standard as required in fiscal 2019, and the provisions of ASU 2016-15 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statement disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”), which requires lessees to include most leases on the balance sheet.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2018.
In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842, which establishes an optional transition practical expedient when applying the guidance in ASU 2016-02 and has the same effective date as the original standard.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2016-02 and intends to implement the standard as required in fiscal 2020.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”), which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP.
Since the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB released several amendments to improve and clarify the implementation guidance, as well as to change the effective date.
These standards have been collectively codified within Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).
ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
ASC 606 permits two transition methods: the full retrospective method and the modified retrospective method.
Under the full retrospective method, the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented with the cumulative effect of applying the standard recognized at the earliest period shown.
Under the modified retrospective method, the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application.
ASC 606 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
The Company will adopt the requirements of the new standard on September 1, 2018.
The Company has an implementation team tasked with identifying potential differences that will result from applying the new revenue recognition standard to the Company's contracts with its customers.
The implementation team reports the findings and progress of the project to management on a frequent basis and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.
The implementation team has completed its initial phase of contract reviews and continues to evaluate the results of those reviews with respect to potential changes from adopting the new standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, the implementation team is in the process of identifying appropriate changes to the Company's business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard.
Based on the implementation team's current findings and the overall expected immaterial impact of adoption, the implementation team is currently evaluating which adoption method would provide the most meaningful information to the Company's stakeholders.

5.Fair Value Measurements



The Company determines fair value measurements based on the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability.
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), establishes a three level hierarchy making a distinction between market participant assumptions based on (i) unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market (Level 1), (ii) quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (Level 2), and (iii) prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement (Level 3).
The Company's cash and cash equivalents (Level 1), which are required to be carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis, were $229.8 million and $311.1 million as of February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, respectively.
The Company utilizes valuation methodologies to determine the fair values of its financial assets and liabilities in conformity with the concepts of “exit price” and the fair value hierarchy as prescribed in ASC 820.
There were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values during the current period.
The Company used quoted market prices to determine the fair value of Level 1 assets and liabilities.
No transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy occurred during the current fiscal period.
In the event of a transfer in or out of a level within the fair value hierarchy, the transfers would be recognized on the date of occurrence.
Disclosures of fair value information about financial instruments (whether or not recognized in the balance sheet), for which it is practicable to estimate that value, are required each reporting period in addition to any financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis as prescribed by ASC 825, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825”).
In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.
Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.
The carrying values and estimated fair values of certain of the Company’s financial instruments were as follows at February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017 (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The senior unsecured public notes are carried at the outstanding balance, net of unamortized bond discount and deferred costs, as of the end of the reporting period.
Fair value is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity (Level 2).
The industrial revenue bond is carried at the outstanding balance as of the end of the reporting period.
The industrial revenue bond is a tax-exempt, variable-rate instrument that resets on a weekly basis; therefore, the Company estimates that the face amount of the bond approximates fair value as of February 28, 2018 based on bonds of similar terms and maturity (Level 2).
The bank loans are carried at the outstanding balance as of the end of the reporting period.
Fair value is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity (Level 2).
ASC 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements.
Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value to the Company.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names that are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.
The Company recorded amortization expense of $6.7 million and $7.8 million during the three months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $13.3 million and $13.7 million during the six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Amortization expense is generally recorded on a straight-line basis and is expected to be approximately $26.3 million in fiscal 2018, $26.0 million in fiscal 2019, $26.0 million in fiscal 2020, $23.1 million in fiscal 2021, and $21.4 million in fiscal 2022.
The acquisition accounting and the related useful lives and amortization for the Lucid acquisition are preliminary as the Company continues to gather information related to the identification and valuation of intangible assets acquired.
8.Earnings Per Share



Basic earnings per share for the periods presented is computed by dividing net earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Other comprehensive income (loss) for the Company includes foreign currency translation and pension adjustments.
The following table presents the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss during the six months ended February 28, 2018 (in millions):

11.Debt



Lines of Credit



On August 27, 2014, the Company executed a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).
The Revolving Credit Facility will mature, and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable, on August 27, 2019.
Generally, amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a Eurocurrency Rate.
Eurocurrency Rate advances can be denominated in a variety of currencies, including U.S.
Dollars, and amounts outstanding bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for the applicable currency plus a margin as determined by the Company's leverage ratio (“Applicable Margin”).
The Applicable Margin is based on the Company’s leverage ratio, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility, with such margin ranging from 1.000% to 1.575%.
The Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of February 28, 2018.
Additionally, the Company is required to pay certain fees in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility, including administrative service fees and an annual facility fee.
The annual facility fee is payable quarterly, in arrears, and is determined by the Company’s leverage ratio as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility.
This facility fee ranges from 0.125% to 0.300% of the aggregate $250.0 million commitment of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility.
The Revolving Credit Facility contains financial covenants, including a minimum interest coverage ratio (“Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio”) and a leverage ratio (“Maximum Leverage Ratio”) of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense (“EBITDA”), as such terms are defined in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement.
These ratios are computed at the end of each fiscal quarter for the most recent 12-month period.
The Revolving Credit Facility allows for a Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio of 2.50 and a Maximum Leverage Ratio of 3.50, subject to certain conditions defined in the financing agreement.
As of February 28, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.
As of February 28, 2018, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $10.2 million, primarily for securing collateral requirements under the Company's casualty insurance programs and for providing credit support for the Company’s industrial revenue bond (not an outstanding amount under the Revolving Credit Facility).
At February 28, 2018, the Company had additional borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility of $244.7 million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the time, which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility less outstanding letters of credit of $5.3 million issued under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Long-term Debt



At February 28, 2018, the Company had $350.0 million of publicly-traded, senior unsecured notes outstanding at a 6% interest rate that are scheduled to mature in December 2019 (the “Unsecured Notes”) and $4.0 million of tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds that are scheduled to mature in 2021.
The Company also had $3.6 million outstanding under fixed-rate bank loans.
Further discussion of the Company's long-term debt is included within the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within the Company’s Form 10-K. 



Interest Expense, net



Interest expense, net, is comprised primarily of interest expense on long-term debt, obligations in connection with non-qualified retirement benefits, and Revolving Credit Facility borrowings, partially offset by interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents.
The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 (in millions):

12.Commitments and Contingencies



In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to the effects of certain contractual stipulations, events, transactions, and laws and regulations that may, at times, require the recognition of liabilities, such as those related to self-insurance reserves and claims, legal and contractual issues, environmental laws and regulations, guarantees, and indemnities.
The Company is conducting a detailed review of this activity to determine the extent of any liabilities and the appropriate remedial measures.
At this time, the Company is unable to determine the likelihood or amount of any loss associated with these shipments.
Product Warranty and Recall Costs 



The Company's products generally have a standard warranty term of five years.
The Company records an allowance for the estimated amount of future warranty costs when the related revenue is recognized.
Estimated future warranty and recall costs are primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty and recall claims.
In certain limited cases, the Company has warranty arrangements for terms that exceed the standard term.
The changes in the reserves for product warranty and recall costs during the six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 are summarized as follows (in millions): 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Securities Class Action



On January 3, 2018, a shareholder filed a class action complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the Company and certain of its officers on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company’s stock between June 29, 2016 and April 3, 2017.
On February 20, 2018, a different shareholder filed a second class action complaint in the same venue against the same parties on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company’s stock between October 15, 2015 and April 3, 2017.
A motion to consolidate the cases has been filed and is presently pending, unopposed.
The plaintiffs seek class certification, unspecified monetary damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees.
The Company disputes the allegations in the complaints and intends to vigorously defend against the claims.
The Company is insured, in excess of a self-retention, for Directors and Officers liability.
The Company establishes reserves for legal claims when associated costs become probable and can be reasonably estimated.
However, the Company cannot make a meaningful estimate of actual costs to be incurred that could possibly be higher or lower than the amounts reserved.
13.Share-based Payments



The Company accounts for share-based payments through the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for share-based payment awards made to employees and directors of the Company, including stock options and restricted shares (all part of the Company's equity incentive plan), and share units representing certain deferrals into the Company's director deferred compensation plan or the Company's supplemental deferred savings plan.
The following table presents share-based payment expense and new shares issued upon exercise of stock options for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 (in millions, except shares):

Further details regarding each of these award programs and the Company's share-based payments are included within the Share-based Payments footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within the Company’s Form 10-K.



14.
Pension Plans



The Company has several pension plans, both qualified and non-qualified, covering certain hourly and salaried employees.
Benefits paid under these plans are based generally on employees’ years of service and/or compensation during the final years of employment.
Plan assets are invested primarily in equity and fixed income securities.
Net periodic pension cost for the Company’s defined benefit pension plans during the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 included the following components before tax (in millions):

15.Special Charge



During fiscal 2017, the Company recognized pre-tax special charges consisting primarily of severance and employee-related benefit costs for the elimination of certain operations and positions following a realignment of the Company's operating structure, including positions within various selling, distribution, and administrative (“SD&A”) departments.
During fiscal 2016, the Company recognized pre-tax special charges primarily related to the Company's continued efforts to integrate recent acquisitions and to streamline the organization by realigning certain responsibilities primarily within various SD&A departments, as well as the consolidation of certain production activities.
The Company did not initiate any such actions during fiscal 2018.
Costs reflected within Special charge on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 primarily include severance and employee-related costs for the 2017 initiative.
Special charges for the six months ended February 28, 2017 primarily reflect lease termination costs associated with fiscal 2016 actions.
No special charges were recorded during the three months ended February 28, 2017.
As of February 28, 2018, remaining restructuring reserves were $9.0 million and are included in Accrued compensation and Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The changes in the reserves related to these programs during the six months ended February 28, 2018 are summarized as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



16.Income Taxes



On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the TCJA, which reduces the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and requires a one-time transition tax on accumulated unremitted foreign earnings.
This provisional amount includes a benefit of $32.3 million to decrease the Company's deferred income taxes to a revised statutory federal rate as well as a current estimate for the provision for unremitted foreign earnings of approximately $1.1 million.
Amounts reflected in the current period are not finalized as the Company continues to evaluate the impact of the TCJA on these components of the Company's ultimate tax liability.
Upon finalization of this calculation, the provisional amount recorded for unremitted foreign earnings may change.
The Company has not yet made a policy election with respect to its treatment of these taxes.
17.Supplemental Guarantor Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements



In December 2009, ABL, the 100% owned and principal operating subsidiary of Acuity Brands, refinanced the then current outstanding debt through the issuance of the Notes.
See Debt and Lines of Credit footnote for further information.
In accordance with the registration rights agreement by and between ABL and the guarantors to the Notes and the initial purchasers of the Notes, ABL and the guarantors to the Notes filed a registration statement with the SEC for an offer to exchange the Notes for an issue of SEC-registered notes with identical terms.
Due to the filing of the registration statement and offer to exchange, the Company determined the need for compliance with Rule 3-10 of SEC Regulation S-X (“Rule 3-10”).
In lieu of providing separate audited financial statements for ABL and ABL IP Holding, the Company has included the accompanying Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements in accordance with Rule 3-10(d) of SEC Regulation S-X since the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Acuity Brands and ABL IP Holding.
The column marked “Parent” represents the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of Acuity Brands.
The column marked “Subsidiary Issuer” represents the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of ABL.
The column entitled “Subsidiary Guarantor” represents the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of ABL IP Holding.
Lastly, the column listed as “Non-Guarantors” includes the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the non-guarantor direct and indirect subsidiaries of Acuity Brands, which consist primarily of foreign subsidiaries.
Consolidating adjustments were necessary in order to arrive at consolidated amounts.
In addition, the equity method of accounting was used to calculate investments in subsidiaries.
