1.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these interim statements have been recorded and are of a normal and recurring nature.
The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed on September 20, 2019, with the SEC.
Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company revised the methodology in how it estimates its excess and obsolete inventory reserves.
See Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Correction of Immaterial Misstatements.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company determined that there was an immaterial misstatement of its excess and obsolete inventory reserves in its previously issued annual and interim financial statements.
The Company corrected this misstatement by recognizing a $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment during the three months ended June 30, 2019, which increased its excess and obsolete inventory reserve and cost of goods sold for the period.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the out-of-period adjustment was a cumulative $0.2 million reduction in its excess and obsolete inventory reserve and cost of goods sold.
In addition, the Company determined that a $1.0 million cash inflow related to an insurance recovery was incorrectly classified as a cash flow from operations instead of a cash flow from investing activities within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2019.
The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2019 correctly reflects the $1.0 million insurance recovery as a cash inflow from investing activities.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 



In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial instruments held at amortized cost.
In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326 Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, that clarifies receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of the credit losses standard, but rather should be accounted for in accordance with the leases standard.
In addition, renewal options that are not unconditionally cancelable should be considered in the determination of expected credit losses.
In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief, which amends ASU 2016-13 to allow companies, upon adoption, to elect the fair value option on financial instruments that were previously recorded at amortized cost if they meet certain criteria.
All of these ASUs are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
ASU 2017-04 simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.
Under ASU 2017-04, entities will be required to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.
ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or interim impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual or interim impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
The amendments should be applied prospectively.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which changes the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820, Fair Value Measurement.
The amendments in this ASU are the result of a broader disclosure project, Concepts Statement No.
8 — Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting — Chapter 8 — Notes to Financial Statements, which the FASB finalized on August 28, 2018.
The FASB used the guidance in the Concepts Statement to improve the effectiveness of ASC 820’s disclosure requirements.
More specifically, ASU 2018-13 requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs that are used to arrive at measures of fair value, including judgments and assumptions that are made in determining fair value.
ASU 2018-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, which makes changes to and clarifies the disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.
ASU 2018-14 also clarifies the guidance in ASC 715 to require disclosure of the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with PBOs in excess of plan assets and the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with ABOs in excess of plan assets.
ASU 2018-14 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract.
ASU 2018-15 clarifies certain aspects of ASU 2015-05, Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.
Specifically, ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementations costs incurred to develop or obtain internal use software.
ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 



During 2019, we adopted the following accounting standards, which had the following impacts on our consolidated financial statements: 



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).
ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity’s leasing arrangements.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which clarified certain aspects of ASU 2016-02, as well as ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, which provided for an optional transition method allowing for the application of the legacy lease guidance, Leases (Topic 840), including its disclosure requirements, for the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption.
In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, Leases (Topic 842) Codification Improvements, which removed the requirement for an entity to disclose in the interim periods after adoption, the effect of the change on income from continuing operations, net income, any other affected financial statement line item, and any affected per share amount.
For lessors, the new leasing standard requires leases to be classified as sales-type, direct financing or operating leases.
These criteria focus on the transfer of control of the underlying lease asset.
This standard and related updates were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company adopted the new standard on January 1, 2019, the effective date of our initial application, using the optional transition method.
The Company has elected to carry forward the legacy ASC 840 disclosures for comparative periods and, therefore, did not adjust the comparative period financial information prior to January 1, 2019.
In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients which allows for companies to not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, not reassess historical lease classifications for expired or existing contracts and not reassess initial direct costs for existing leases.
Additionally, the Company elected the practical expedients which allow the use of hindsight when determining the lease term, the short-term lease recognition exemption and the option to not separate lease and non-lease components.
See Note 11 for additional information.
As a lessor, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income or Condensed Statement of Cash Flow.
Prior to and after adoption, all of our leases in which we are the lessor were classified as sales-types leases.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08, Receivables – Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which shortened the amortization period for the premium on certain purchased callable debt securities to the earliest call date.
ASU 2017-08 was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
The amendments were required to be applied through a modified-retrospective transition approach that required a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
The Company adopted ASU 2017-08 on January 1, 2019, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.
ASU 2017-12 expanded and refined hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligned the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedge items in the financial statements, and included certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting, which permits the OIS rate based on SOFR as a U.S. benchmark interest rate.
Both ASU 2017-12 and ASU 2018-16 were effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
The Company adopted ASU 2017-12 on January 1, 2019, and the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements as we currently do not have any hedging instruments.
ASU 2018-02 was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
The Company adopted ASU 2018-02 on January 1, 2019, and upon adoption reclassified $0.4 million of stranded tax effects created by rate changes related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to retained earnings.
See Note 12 for additional information.

2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 



On November 30, 2018, we acquired SmartRG, Inc., a provider of carrier-class, open connected home platforms and cloud services for broadband service providers in exchange for cash consideration.
This transaction was accounted for as a business combination.
The revenue from the SmartRG portfolio is included in the Subscriber Solutions & Experience category within the Network Solutions and Services & Support reportable segments.
Contingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date, the payments of which were dependent upon SmartRG achieving future revenue, EBIT or customer purchase order milestones during the first half of 2019.
The required milestones were not achieved and, therefore, we recognized a gain of $1.2 million upon the reversal of these liabilities during the second quarter of 2019.
An escrow in the amount of $2.8 million was set up at the acquisition date to fund post-closing working capital settlements and to satisfy indemnity obligations to the Company arising from any inaccuracy or breach of representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the sellers.
The escrow is subject to arbitration with final settlement expected during the fourth quarter of 2020.
The minimum and maximum potential release of funds to the sellers ranges from zero to $2.8 million.
We recorded goodwill of $3.5 million as a result of this acquisition, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired.
The final allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date for SmartRG are as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The details of the acquired intangible assets from the SmartRG acquisition are as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, we incurred amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, related to the SmartRG acquisition.
No acquisition-related expenses were incurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 related to the SmartRG acquisition.
On March 19, 2018, we acquired Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s (SEL) North American EPON business and entered into a technology license and OEM supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. (SEI).
This transaction was accounted for as a business combination.
This revenue is included in the Access & Aggregation and Subscriber Solutions & Experience categories within the Network Solutions reportable segment.
We recorded a bargain purchase gain, net of income taxes, of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, which represents the difference between the fair-value of the net assets acquired over the cash paid.
14 



The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents the financial results of the Company, for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as if the acquisition of the Sumitomo EPON business had occurred on January 1, 2017.
This unaudited supplemental pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2017, nor is it indicative of any future results.
There were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information.

3.
REVENUE 



The following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate our revenue by reportable segment.
Network Solutions Segment 



Network Solutions includes hardware products and software-defined next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks, as well as prior generation products.
The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware sales.
In certain transactions, we are also the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment.
These arrangements typically include network equipment, network implementation services and maintenance services.
Network implementation services and maintenance services are included in the Services & Support segment discussed below.
See Note 11 for additional information.
Services & Support Segment 



To complement our Network Solutions segment, we offer a complete portfolio of maintenance, network implementation and solutions integration and managed services, which include hosted cloud services and subscription services.
In addition to our reporting segments, we also report revenue in the following three categories – Access & Aggregation, Subscriber Solutions & Experience, and Traditional & Other Products.
With the increasing focus on enhancing the customer experience for both our business and consumer broadband customers and the addition of SmartRG during the fourth quarter of 2018, Subscriber Solutions & Experience more accurately represents this revenue category.
The following table disaggregates our revenue by reportable segment and revenue category for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



15 



(1)  



Subscriber Solutions & Experience was formerly reported as Customer Devices.
With the increasing focus on enhancing the customer experience for both our business and consumer broadband customers and the addition of SmartRG during the fourth quarter of 2018, Subscriber Solutions & Experience more accurately represents this revenue category.
Revenue is measured based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied.
As of June 30, 2019, we did not have any significant performance obligations related to customer contracts that had an original expected duration of one year or more, other than maintenance services, which are satisfied over time.
Of the outstanding unearned revenue balance at December 31, 2018, $3.6 million and $10.5 million was recognized as revenue during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
4.
INCOME TAXES 



Our effective tax rate decreased from a benefit of 20.1%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, in the six months ended June 30, 2018, to a benefit of 6.2% in the six months ended June 30, 2019.
The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods was primarily driven by the shift to profitability in the six months ended June 30, 2019, with tax expense being offset by a 29.1% rate reduction related to a transfer pricing study completed during the second quarter of 2019 that resulted in the assignment of operating expenditures to specific company locations, and the effective income tax rates among the respective jurisdictions.
As of June 30, 2019, we had net deferred tax assets of $39.0 million.
Since management continues to assess the realization of these deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance(s), as such, we may release a portion of the valuation allowance or establish a new valuation allowance based on operations in the jurisdictions in which these assets arose.
Due to operating losses incurred in prior quarters in the United States, the Company is currently near breakeven on its three-year cumulative income position for this tax jurisdiction.
5.
PENSION BENEFIT PLAN 



We maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering employees in certain foreign countries.
The following table summarizes the components of net periodic pension cost for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



16 



The components of net periodic pension cost, other than the service cost component, are included in other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
6.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 



The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, performance stock units (PSUs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Stock Options 



The following table is a summary of our stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2019, and the changes that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2019: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



At June 30, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options was approximately $0.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 0.4 years.
All of the options above were issued at exercise prices that approximated fair market value at the date of grant.
The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between ADTRAN’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the quarter and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on June 30, 2019.
The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of ADTRAN’s stock and was zero as of June 30, 2019.
The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $0.1 million.
The fair value of our stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes model.
The stock option pricing model requires the use of several assumptions that impact the fair value estimate.
There were no stock options granted during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 or 2018.
At June 30, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested portion of market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock was approximately $14.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.6 years.
In addition, there was $8.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested 2017 performance-based PSUs, which will be recognized over the remaining requisite service period of 0.5 years if achievement of the performance obligation becomes probable.
For the three and six months ending June 30, 2019 and 2018, no compensation expense was recognized related to these 2017 performance-based PSUs.
At June 30, 2019, 2.6 million stock options, PSUs, RSUs or restricted stock were available for grant under shareholder-approved equity plans.
7.
Realized gains and losses on sales of debt securities are computed under the specific identification method.
The following table presents gross realized gains and losses related to our debt securities: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Our investment policy provides limitations for issuer concentration, which limits, at the time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market value of our total investment portfolio.
At June 30, 2019, we held a $25.6 million restricted certificate of deposit that is carried at cost.
This investment serves as a collateral deposit against the principal amount outstanding under loans made to ADTRAN pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the “Bond”), which totaled $25.6 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of the Bond using a level 2 valuation technique was approximately $25.6 million and $25.4 million, respectively, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard and Poor’s credit rating of AAA.
The Bond matures on January 1, 2020, and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum.
In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the State of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings we are required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under this program.
The restricted funds held as collateral against the outstanding principal amount of the Bond will be used to pay the outstanding principal and interest upon the Bond’s maturity on January 1, 2020.
Marketable Equity Securities 



Our marketable equity securities consist of publicly traded stock, funds and certain other investments measured at fair value or cost (where appropriate).
19 



On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01, which requires us to measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value, with any changes in fair value recognized in net investment gain (loss).
ASU 2016-01 also provides a measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value in which investments can be recorded at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes for an identical or similar investment.
We elected to record our equity investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value using the measurement alternative method.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a note receivable of approximately $4.3 million, which was included in other receivables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, this amount was repaid as follows.
Approximately $3.4 million was issued as an equity investment, which represented a non-cash investing activity.
The carrying value of this investment under the measurement alternative was $3.4 million as of June 30, 2019.
The remaining amount was converted into a new note receivable, which is included in other receivables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and represents a non-cash operating activity.
20 



We have categorized our cash equivalents and our investments held at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique for the cash equivalents and investments as follows: Level 1 - Values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market; Level 2 - Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; Level 3 - Values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
These inputs include information supplied by investees.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



21 



The fair value of our Level 2 securities is calculated using a weighted average market price for each security.
These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each security.
8.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our inventory reserve was $31.0 million and $30.0 million, respectively.
9.
GOODWILL  



Goodwill, all of which relates to our acquisitions of Bluesocket, Inc. in 2011 and SmartRG in 2018, was $7.0 million and $7.1 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, of which $6.6 million and $0.4 million is allocated to our Network Solutions and Services & Support reportable segments, respectively, as of June 30, 2019, and of which $6.7 million and $0.4 million was allocated to our Network Solutions and Services & Support reportable segments, respectively, as of December 31, 2018.
Goodwill related to our SmartRG acquisition was reduced by $0.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019, as a result of a measurement period adjustment.
We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.
We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test.
If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test will be performed.
10.
The following table presents our intangible assets as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018:  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Amortization expense was $1.3 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 respectively, and $2.7 million and $1.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
22 



As of June 30, 2019, the estimated future amortization expense of our intangible assets was as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



11.
We also have other contracts, such as manufacturing agreements and service agreements, which we reviewed to determine if they contain any embedded leases.
As of June 30, 2019, our operating leases have remaining lease terms of one month to six years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to three years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within three months.
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Supplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases is as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



(1)  



Reflects the adoption of the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019.
There are no legally binding leases that have not yet commenced.
As of December 31, 2018, future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases, including renewals determined to be reasonably assured as of December 31, 2018, with original maturities of greater than 12 months, are as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



(1)  



Certain renewal options were subsequently determined to not be reasonably assured of renewal upon the Company’s adoption of the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019.
Our leases do not provide an implicit borrowing rate and therefore we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
We used the incremental borrowing rate on January 1, 2019, for operating leases that commenced on or prior to that date.
The incremental borrowing rate was determined on a portfolio basis by grouping leases with similar terms as well as grouping leases based on a U.S. dollar or Euro functional currency.
The actual rate is then determined based on a credit spread over LIBOR as well as the Bloomberg Curve Matrix for the U.S. Communications section.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Supplemental cash flow information related to operating leases was as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales-Type Lease Arrangements 



We are the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment, which have initial terms of up to five years.
The allocation of the consideration between lease and non-lease components is determined by standalone sales price by component.
The net investment in sales-type leases consists of lease receivables less unearned income.
Collectability of sales-type leases is evaluated periodically at an individual customer level.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had no allowance for credit losses for our net investment in sales-type leases.
As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the components of the net investment in sales-type leases were as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The components of sales-type lease gross profit recognized at the lease commencement date and interest and dividend income, included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, are as follows:

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY 



Stock Repurchase Program 



Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized repurchases of our common stock, which are implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant.
As of June 30, 2019, we had the authority to purchase an additional 2.5 million shares of our common stock under the current authorization of up to 5.0 million shares.
See Note 1.

EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE 



A summary of the calculation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 is as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, 1.9 million and 5.0 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, 2.3 million and 4.8 million, respectively, stock options were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because the stock options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares, during the applicable periods, therefore making them anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.
For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, 15,000 and 0.1 million, respectively, and for both the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, 0.1 million PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock awards were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because the weighted average assumed proceeds per share were greater than the average market price of the common shares, during the applicable periods, therefore making them anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.
