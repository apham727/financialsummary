Agreement and Plan of Merger



On November 11, 2018, Black Box entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with AGC Networks Pte Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Singapore (“Top Parent”), BBX Main Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Top Parent (“Parent”), BBX Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“BBX Intermediate”), and Host Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of BBX Intermediate (“Merger Sub”, and, together with Top Parent, Parent and BBX Intermediate, the “Parent Entities” and each, a “Parent Entity”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Top Parent, Parent and BBX Intermediate have agreed to cause Merger Sub to commence a tender offer to purchase any and all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company, at a price of $1.08 per Share, net to the holder thereof, in cash, without interest thereon.
The Black Box Board of Directors unanimously approved the merger agreement following a thorough review of the full range of available strategic, financial and capital structure alternatives, which Black Box commenced and announced on February 6, 2018.
The transaction is expected to close prior to the end of the calendar year.
Sale of Federal Business



On August 27, 2018, the Company closed on its previously announced agreement to sell its Federal Government IT Services Business (the “Federal Business”) to Arlington Capital Partners, a leading private equity firm with a focus on businesses in government services and other adjacent markets, for a cash purchase price of $75.0 million.
Arlington Capital Partners purchased 100% of the equity interests of the Federal Business on a debt-free, cash-free basis.
The net cash proceeds from the sale of the Federal Business, after purchase price adjustments of $5.6 million, transaction fees and expenses of $3.2 million as well as $3.0 million of funds deposited into escrow for the finalization of certain closing items as well as certain indemnifications, were used to pay Bank fees, interest on bank debt and indebtedness.
After fees and interest, the new $10 million LIFO senior revolving credit facility was paid first and the Term Loan was paid in full, with the remaining funds reducing the original Revolving Credit Line.
The LIFO line is available for future borrowings, subject to continued compliance with the Second Amended Credit Agreement.
Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement



 29

On June 29, 2018, the Company and certain direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, the “Guarantors” and together with the Company, the “Loan Parties”) entered into a Second Amendment (the “Second Amended Credit Agreement” or the “Second Amendment”) with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the “Agent”), and certain other lenders party thereto (together with the Agent, the “Lenders”) to amend the Credit Agreement entered into among the Loan Parties, the Agent and the Lenders on May 9, 2016 (as amended by the Amendment and Joinder Agreement, dated August 9, 2017, the “Amended Credit Agreement,” and as further amended by the “Second Amended Credit Agreement”).
The Second Amended Credit Agreement established a new “last in first out” senior revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $10,000 (the “LIFO Facility”).
The borrowings under the LIFO Facility will be used to finance the Company’s cash flow needs, subject to an approved budget and certain variance restrictions, including payments to vendors to allow the Company to operate in the ordinary course of its business.
Interest on the LIFO Facility is LIBOR plus 10.0%.
The Company entered into the Second Amendment to waive and modify certain covenants and other provisions contained in the Amended Credit Agreement and to fund its ongoing operations with the LIFO Facility.
The Company would have defaulted the minimum Adjusted EBITDA covenant and certain other covenants as defined by the Amended Credit Agreement had these defaults not been waived under the Second Amendment.
The Company



Black Box is a leading digital solutions provider dedicated to helping customers design, build, manage and secure their IT infrastructure.
The Company offers Services and Products that it distributes through two platforms that it has built over its 42-year history.
Our Services platform is comprised of engineering and design, project management, field service management, network operations centers, our national technology team, national and international sales teams and technology solutions centers which include dedicated sales and engineering resources.
The primary services offered through this platform include managed services, infrastructure services (including wired and wireless network solutions, structured cabling and video/AV services), communications lifecycle services, unified communications and data center services.
The Company generates revenues in its Services business from the design, sale and/or installation of new communications and network infrastructure systems, the support of existing systems and on demand services.
We periodically generate revenues from contracts performed over time that may result in an asset on our balance sheet for multiple periods constituting part of our working capital.
We have not experienced significant collectability issues related to such contracts.
The Company is continually bidding on new projects for services revenues.
Projects account for the majority of Services revenues and are primarily driven by the overall economic environment and information technology capital spending.
New communications systems orders often generate post-implementation maintenance via a fixed fee model where revenues are earned ratably over the term of the agreement (generally 1-3 years for commercial clients and 3-5 years for government clients) or a variable fee model that is based on time and materials per occurrence, similar to on demand services.
Maintenance and on demand services revenues are also dependent upon the Company's relationship with its clients and its long track record of providing high-quality service.
The Company's Services business generates backlog which is defined by the Company as orders and contracts considered to be firm.
At September 30, 2018, the Company's total backlog, which relates primarily to Services, was $247,317, of which $173,476 is expected to be completed within the next twelve months.
Under our Products platform, we provide networking solutions through the sale of products for KVM switching, IT infrastructure, specialty networking and multimedia.
Products sells through a direct sales team as well as through its internet site and catalogs.
The market for these products is a highly fragmented and competitive.
The Company has participated in this market for 40+ years and has earned a reputation for providing high quality products, rapid order fulfillment and free 24/7/365 technical support.

Our platforms introduce scale, flexibility and leverage to the business, and provide the following competitive advantages:

Liquidity Position



The following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Prior periods were adjusted to reflect the Company's continuing operations.
(2) The 4Q18 unused commitments relate to the Amended Credit Agreement.
The Second Amendment established a new LIFO Facility in an amount not to exceed $10,000.
See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our Second Amended Credit Agreement.
The Company's liquidity (cash and cash equivalents and unused credit commitments) was $31,943 at the end of the second quarter of Fiscal 2019, compared to $35,600 at the end of Fiscal 2018.
This decrease in liquidity was driven by a decline in cash on hand partially offset by the increased availability provided by the new LIFO line of credit.
On August 9, 2017, the Company and certain of the Banks entered into an Amendment and Joinder Agreement to amend and restate the Credit Agreement (as amended and restated, the “Amended Credit Agreement”) in order to avoid a default of its leverage covenant.
Under the Amended Credit Agreement, the credit facility was reduced to $170,000 and comprised of a $50,000 term loan and $120,000 line of credit.
As of August 9, 2017, $50,000 was borrowed under the term loan and $52,528 remained outstanding under the line of credit.
The amortization of the term loan was $1,250 per quarter for four (4) quarters beginning in the quarter ending December 31, 2017 and $2,500 per quarter beginning in the quarter ending December 31, 2018 through the end of the Amended Credit Agreement on May 9, 2021, the same expiration date of the Credit Agreement.
Mandatory prepayments of the term loan were required with the net proceeds from certain asset sales, insurance recoveries and debt or equity issuances, as well as from 75% to 50%of any excess cash flow generated in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2020.
Interest on the term loan was, at the Company’s option: (i) a Base Rate Option equal to the highest of (x) the federal funds open rate, plus fifty (50) basis points (0.5%), (y) the bank’s prime rate, and (z) the daily LIBOR rate, plus 100 basis points (1.0%), in each case plus 2.5% or (ii) LIBOR 



 35

plus 3.5%.
Interest on outstanding indebtedness under the line of credit accrued, at the Company’s option, at a rate based on either: (a) the Base Rate Option plus 0.25% to 2.00% (determined by a leverage ratio based on the Company’s consolidated EBITDA) or (b) a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate plus 1.25% to 3.00% (determined by a leverage ratio based on the Company’s consolidated EBITDA).
Under the Amended Credit Agreement, the leverage ratio covenant was suspended until the second quarter of Fiscal 2019.
The Amended Credit Agreement contained a minimum Adjusted EBITDA covenant and a provision requiring the Company to repay revolving credit loans with any excess cash.
During that same period, a covenant was established to limit capital expenditures to an agreed upon amount.
The ability of the Company to make dividends or other distributions (including stock repurchases other than up to a limited dollar amount for tax payments from vested equity awards) was eliminated.
The leverage ratio covenant that was to commence in the second quarter of Fiscal 2019 was to be 4.00 to 1.00 and was to reduce to 3.00 to 1.00 over the remaining life of the credit facility.
A fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 was to begin in the second quarter of Fiscal 2019 and increase to 1.10 to 1.00 in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019 and thereafter.
Entity”) and are guaranteed by such domestic subsidiaries.
Under the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company and each U.S.
Entity pledged 65% of the voting ownership interests and 100% of the non-voting ownership interests of its foreign subsidiaries.
On June 29, 2018, the Company and the Loan Parties entered into a Second Amendment with the Lenders to amend the Credit Agreement entered into on May 9, 2016 (as amended by Amended Credit Agreement and as further amended by the Second Amended Credit Agreement).
The Second Amended Credit Agreement established a new LIFO Facility in an amount not to exceed $10,000.
The borrowings under the LIFO Facility will be used to finance the Company’s cash flow needs, subject to an approved budget and certain variance restrictions, including payments to vendors to allow the Company to operate in the ordinary course of its business.
Interest on the LIFO Facility is LIBOR plus 10.0%.
The Company entered into the Second Amendment to waive and modify certain covenants and other provisions contained in the Amended Credit Agreement and to fund its ongoing operations with the LIFO Facility.
As part of the Company’s review of its alternatives, the Company has agreed under the Second Amended Credit Agreement to pursue the sale (the “Sale Transaction”) of its federal government IT services business (the “Federal Business”).
On August 27, 2018, the Company completed the sale of the Federal Business.
All net cash proceeds of the Sale Transaction were used to pay down loans outstanding under the LIFO Facility, and after, repayment of such loans, the Company’s other indebtedness under the Second Amended Credit Agreement.
The Second Amended Credit Agreement, among other things, (i) waived certain potential defaults and events of default under the Amended Credit Agreement; (ii) deferred principal and interest payments on the Company’s existing term loans and revolving loans, except the LIFO Facility, the maturity date of the LIFO Facility; provided that the aggregate amount of deferred principal and interest payments through the closing of the Sale Transaction will be due upon such closing; and (iii) modified the interest rates applicable to such outstanding loans so that interest accrues at a rate equal to: (a) for the term loan, the highest of (1) the federal funds open rate plus 0.5%, (2) the Agent’s prime rate or (3) LIBOR plus 1.0% (the “Base Rate”), in each case plus 2.5%, and (b) for the revolving loans, the Base Rate plus an amount between 0.25% and 2.0% (as determined by a leverage ratio based on the Company’s consolidated EBITDA).
The Second Amended Credit Agreement also revised the Company’s covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) suspend the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants until December 15, 2018; (ii) modify the minimum consolidated EBITDA covenant to require that the Company’s minimum consolidated EBITDA for the three fiscal month period ending on the close of each fiscal month equal or exceed (i) negative $3,000 for the fiscal months ending June 30, 2018, July 31, 2018 and August 31, 2018, and (ii) negative $3,500 for the fiscal months ending September 30, 2018 and thereafter; (iii) reduce the sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit to $10,000; (iv) require periodic delivery of updated budgets and budget variance reports to the Agent and compliance with certain disbursement and net cash flow variance thresholds; (v) restrict the incurrence of expenses related to implementation of the ERP system; (vii) require that the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales and certain excess cash be used to prepay the Company’s obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement; and (viii) require the repatriation to the Loan Parties of cash on hand above a certain amount maintained by certain excluded foreign subsidiaries of the Loan Parties and restrict the transfer of assets by the Loan Parties (other than inventory in the course of ordinary business) to such excluded foreign subsidiaries unless accounted for in the budget.
As of September 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Second Amended Credit Agreement.
In addition, under the Second Amendment, the Company’s obligations are required to be secured by additional collateral, including (i) a first-priority pledge of all of the capital stock of each existing and subsequently acquired or organized subsidiary of the Loan Parties not pledged under the Credit Agreement, with certain exceptions; and (ii) mortgages over certain material real property of the Loan Parties located in the U.S.
The Company is also required to cause the execution of deposit account control agreements with respect to certain U.S. bank accounts of the Loan Parties and to deliver to the Agent executed assignment agreements and forms of notice of assignment with respect to certain federal government contracts.
Such notices may be sent upon an event of default or potential default.
Effectiveness of the Second Amendment was subject to certain conditions precedent, each of which were satisfied on June 29, 2018.
The outstanding balance of the LIFO Facility and all accrued and unpaid interest, fees and expenses were originally due and payable on December 15, 2018 or the earlier proper termination of the LIFO Facility by the Agent following an event of default.
On November 17, 2018, the maturity of the LIFO Facility was extended from December 15, 2018 until January 17, 2019, subject to certain terms and conditions.
