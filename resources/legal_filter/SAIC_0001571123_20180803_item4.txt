Item 4.
Controls and Procedures



Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and have concluded that as of August 3, 2018, these controls and procedures were operating and effective.
Remediation efforts included improving the design of program control and time sheet review controls over contracts with multi-customer funding sources and increased training and awareness in the administration of such contracts.
