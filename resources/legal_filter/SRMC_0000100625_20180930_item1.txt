SIERRA MONITOR CORPORATION 



Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Financial Statements 



September 30, 2018 



Basis of Presentation 



The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared by Sierra Monitor Corporation (the “Company”, “Sierra Monitor”, “we” or “us”), pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
In the opinion of the Company, all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company for the interim period have been included.
Summary of Business 



Founded in 1978, Sierra Monitor Corporation (OTCQB:SRMC), is a provider of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solutions that address the industrial and commercial facilities management targeting facility automation and facility safety requirements, also referred to as “Connect” and “Protect”.
The Company’s FieldServer family of protocol gateways, routers, and network explorers targets facility automation requirements, and is used by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and system integrators to enable local and remote monitoring and control of assets and facilities.
The FieldServer family of products works with the SMC Cloud portal; a cloud-based service that registers and manages FieldServer products, provides secure remote access to the local web-based applications that run on FieldServer products, and integrates with third-party applications over REST APIs.
With more than 200,000 installed gateways supporting over 140 protocols such as BACnet, LonWorks, MODBUS, and XML in commercial and industrial facilities, FieldServer is the industry’s leading multi-protocol gateway brand and is delivered in a variety of form factors appropriate to the asset being interfaced.
The intellectual property in FieldServer products is embodied in the proprietary embedded software that runs on a variety of customized hardware platforms with different connectivity options such as Serial, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or cellular.
In addition to bridging data protocols between various assets or devices within a facility, the embedded software includes value-added “fog” or “local application” software for monitoring, logging, alarming, and trending local field data.
Additionally, the embedded software enables the assets or devices in the facility to securely connect to third-party clouds and to the Company’s own SMC Cloud portal.
The SMC Cloud portal is a proprietary, secure, and scalable Software-as-a-Service product and is developed and deployed using the same core technologies and providers that are used by many of the world’s leading web sites and Internet-based services.

The Company’s Flame and Gas (F&G) detection solutions target facility safety requirements and are used by industrial and commercial facilities managers to protect their personnel and assets.
The motivation for installing gas detection systems is driven, in part, by industrial safety professionals guided by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration, state and local governing bodies, insurance companies and various industry rule-making bodies.
The solution consists of proprietary system hardware that runs embedded controller and gateway software, detector modules that sense the presence of various toxic and combustible gases and flames, connectivity between the modules and the controller, and a user interface and applications that a facility manager can interact with, either locally on site or remotely over the Internet.
The complex software embedded in the various products facilitates system-wide functions such as calibration, alarm detection, notification, and mitigation.
The controller software also includes local web-based applications that simplify management of the complete solution and a gateway to integrate the flame and gas detection solution with the facility’s local supervisory system or to the Company’s SMC Cloud portal.
With more than 100,000 detector modules sold, our flame and gas detection solutions are deployed in a variety of facilities, such as oil, gas and chemical processing plants, wastewater treatment facilities, alternate fuel vehicle maintenance garages and other sites where hazardous gases are used or produced.
The Company’s solutions are also sold to telecommunication companies and their suppliers to manage environmental and security conditions such as temperature, gas, and smoke in remote structures such as local DSL distribution nodes and buildings at cell tower sites.
The Company was founded in 1978 and its common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol “SRMC”.
Accounting Policies 



   a) Revenue Recognition  



In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606).
ASC 606 requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the considerations to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 by using the modified retrospective method.
The comparative information has not been recast and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
The majority of the impact has been on sales returns and the impact has been deemed immaterial.
The Company’s revenues are derived from the sale of FieldServer products, FieldServer products services, Gas Detection and Environment Control products, and Gas Detection and Environment Control products services.
The Company’s revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services.
Determining the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements.
When the Company’s products and services are sold in bundled arrangements (e.g., hardware, software, and/or services), for bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.
The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products or services in a bundle based on their individual SSP.
The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services.
Page 6 of 22 



The following is a description of the principal activities from which the Company generates its revenues: 



Gas Detection and Environment Control Products 



Gas Detection and Environment Control Products are sold as off-the-shelf products with prices fixed at the time of order.
The creditworthiness of customers is assessed prior to the Company accepting a customer’s first order.
Additionally, international customers and customers who have developed a history of payment problems are generally required to prepay or pay through a letter-of-credit.
Gas Detection and Environment Control Services 



Gas detection and environment control services consist of field service orders (technical support) and training, which are provided separately from product orders.
Revenue recognition occurs only when the service activity is completed.
Such services are provided to current and prior customers, and, as noted above, creditworthiness has generally already been assessed.
In cases where the probability of receiving payment is low, a credit card number is collected for immediate processing.
Revenue is recognized in the period the technical support and training are performed.
FieldServer Products 



FieldServer products are sold in the same manner as Gas Detection and Environment Control Products (as discussed above) except that the products contain embedded software, which is integral to the operation of the device.
The software embedded in FieldServer products includes two items: (a) a compiled program containing (i) the basic operating system for FieldServer products, which is common to every unit, and (ii) the correct set of protocol drivers based on the customer order (see FieldServer Services below for more information); and (b) a configuration file that identifies and links each data point as identified by the customer.
The Company determined that the hardware, and the embedded software as defined above represent one performance obligation because the hardware is dependent upon and highly interrelated with the embedded software, and without which the hardware can’t operate.
If the software requires modification, refer to FieldServer Services for details.
FieldServer Services 



FieldServer services consist of orders for custom development of protocol drivers.
However, if custom development of the protocol driver is required, the product order is not processed until development of the protocol driver is complete.
The driver development involves further research after receipt of order, preparation of a scope document to be approved by the customer and then engineering time to write, test and release the driver program.
When development of the driver is complete the customer is notified and can proceed with a FieldServer product.
Revenues for protocol driver development are recognized at a point in time when the control of the product is transferred to the customer generally occurring upon shipment or delivery of the related product that includes the developed protocol drivers (as noted in FieldServer Products above).
No allowances are offered to customers.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-2, “Leases” (Topic 842), which is intended to improve financial reporting for lease transactions.
This ASU will require organizations that lease assets, such as real estate, airplanes and manufacturing equipment, to recognize on their balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights to use those assets for the lease term and obligations to make lease payments created by those leases that have terms of greater than 12 months.
The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as finance or operating lease.
This ASU will also require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount and timing of cash flows arising from leases.
The ASU is effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2019 and interim reporting periods within that year, and early adoption is permitted.
Management has not yet determined the effect of this ASU on the Company’s financial statements.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new lease accounting standards on its financial statements.
The Company is in process of creating an inventory of its leases where the Company may be a lessee to assess the potential impact to the Company’s financial statements upon adoption of the new lease accounting standards.
c) Employee Stock-Based Compensation  



In April 2016 and in May 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors and the Company’s shareholders, respectively, approved the Company’s 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2016 Stock Plan”) and reserved a total of (i) 279,680 shares, plus (ii) 2,550,320 shares that remained available for issuance under the 2006 Stock Plan immediately prior to its expiration, plus (iii) any shares subject to stock options or restricted stock granted under the 2006 Stock Plan that, on or after the date the 2016 Stock Plan became effective, expired or otherwise terminated without having been exercised in full, or were forfeited to or repurchased by the Company, with the maximum number of shares to be added to the 2016 Stock Plan pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) equal to 2,668,320.
Options granted under our 2006 Stock Plan and 2016 Stock Plan are at the fair market value of our common stock at the grant date, typically vest ratably over four years, and expire ten years from the grant date.
As of September 30, 2018, a total of 1,216,000 shares were issued under the 2016 Stock Plan.
All share-based payments to employees (incentive stock options) are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at the date of grant.
The calculated fair value is recognized as expense (net of any capitalization) over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the straight-line method.
The Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class and historical experience.
The modified prospective method of application requires compensation expense to be recognized in the financial statements for all unvested stock options beginning in the quarter of award.
The cost is based on the grant date fair value of the stock option.
Compensation expense recognized in future periods for share-based compensation will be adjusted for the effects of estimated forfeitures.
There was no material impact on the Company’s basic and diluted net loss per share as a result of recognizing the employee stock-based compensation expense.
Inventories 



A summary of inventories follows: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Net Income (Loss) Per Share 



Basic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.
Dilutive potential common shares consist of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method.
No adjustments to earnings were made for purposes of per share calculations.
At September 30, 2018, outstanding options to acquire 208,000 shares of common stock were not considered potentially dilutive common shares due to the exercise price of such options being higher than the stock price used in the EPS calculation.
Page 9 of 22 



The following is a reconciliation of the shares used in the computation of basic and diluted EPS for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively:

For the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, Sierra Monitor Corporation (“we” or the “Company”) reported net sales of $5,994,234 compared to $5,177,199 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2017.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, net sales were $16,695,848 compared with $14,539,809 in the prior year nine-month period.
The sales results for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 represent an increase of 16% and 15% compared to each of the same periods in 2017.
For the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of our instrumentation products, including fire and gas detection, military sales and environment controllers, were approximately $2,813,000 compared to approximately $2,536,000 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, representing an 11% increase.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of our instrumentation products were approximately $8,116,000 compared to approximately $6,906,000 in the same period in 2017 representing an 18% increase.
In the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of FieldServer products were approximately $3,181,000 compared to approximately $2,641,000 in the same period in 2017, representing a 20% increase.
In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, sales of our FieldServer products were approximately $8,580,000, compared to approximately $7,634,000 in sales reported in the same period in 2017, representing a 12% increase.
Page 12 of 22 



FieldServer sales include both box products and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) modules.
Box products provide a platform for delivery and operation of our software for integration with building automation systems and are generally sold to building automation integrators.
Gross profit for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 was approximately $3,630,000, or 61% of net sales, compared to approximately $3,105,000, or 60% of net sales, in the same period in the previous year.
Gross profit for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018 was approximately $10,006,000, or 60% of net sales, compared to approximately $8,626,000, or 59% of net sales, in the same period in the previous year.
Expenses for research and development, which include new product development and engineering to sustain existing products, were approximately $805,000, or 13% of net sales, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 compared to approximately $768,000, or 15% of net sales, in the comparable period in 2017.
In the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, research and development expenses were approximately $2,371,000, or 14% of net sales, and approximately $2,296,000, or 16% of net sales, respectively.

General and administrative expenses have increased 36% in the three-month period and increased 24% in the nine-month reporting periods ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017, primarily due to increased salary expenses and outsourced professionals.
In the three-month period ended September 30, 2018, our income from operations was approximately $321,000 compared to income from operations of approximately $369,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2017.
In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, our income from operations was approximately $498,000 compared to a loss from operations of approximately $447,000 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017.
The loss in the nine-month period of 2017 was due to non-recurring expenses.
After interest income and provision for income tax expense, our net income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2018 was approximately $214,000 compared to net income of approximately $192,000 in the same period of 2017.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, our net income was approximately $311,000 compared to a net loss of approximately $367,000 in the same period of 2017.

We maintain a line of credit with our commercial bank in the maximum amount of $2,000,000.
No borrowings have been made under our line of credit during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 and there were no outstanding balances at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
As of September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the line of credit.
We believe that our present resources, including cash and accounts receivable, are sufficient to fund our anticipated level of operations through at least December 2019.
ASC 606 requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the considerations to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 by using the modified retrospective method.
The comparative information has not been recast and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
The majority of the impact has been on sales returns and the impact has been deemed immaterial.
The Company’s revenues are derived from the sale of FieldServer products, FieldServer products services, Gas Detection and Environment Control products, and Gas Detection and Environment Control products services.
Page 14 of 22 



The Company’s revenue arrangements consist of multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, and services.
Determining the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements.
When the Company’s products and services are sold in bundled arrangements (e.g., hardware, software, and/or services), for bundled arrangements, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.
The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products or services in a bundle based on their individual SSP.
The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products and services.
The following is a description of the principal activities from which the Company generates its revenues: 



Gas Detection and Environment Control Products 



Gas Detection and Environment Control Products are sold as off-the-shelf products with prices fixed at the time of order.
The creditworthiness of customers is assessed prior to the Company accepting a customer’s first order.
Additionally, international customers and customers who have developed a history of payment problems are generally required to prepay or pay through a letter-of-credit.
Gas Detection and Environment Control Services 



Gas detection and environment control services consist of field service orders (technical support) and training, which are provided separate from product orders.
Revenue recognition occurs only when the service activity is completed.
Such services are provided to current and prior customers, and, as noted above, creditworthiness has generally already been assessed.
In cases where the probability of receiving payment is low, a credit card number is collected in advance of the provision of services for immediate processing.
Revenue is recognized in the period the technical support and training are performed.
Page 15 of 22 



FieldServer Products 



FieldServer products are sold in the same manner as Gas Detection and Environment Control Products (as discussed above) except that the products contain embedded software, which is integral to the operation of the device.
The software embedded in FieldServer products includes two items: (a) a compiled program containing (i) the basic operating system for FieldServer products, which is common to every unit, and (ii) customized protocol drivers based on the customer order (see FieldServer Services below for more information); and (b) a configuration file that identifies and links each data point as identified by the customer.
The Company determined that the hardware, and the embedded software as defined above represent one performance obligation because the hardware is dependent upon and highly interrelated with the embedded software, and without which the hardware can’t operate.
FieldServer Services 



FieldServer services consist of orders for custom development of protocol drivers.
However, if custom development of the protocol driver is required, the product order is not processed until development of the protocol driver is complete.
The driver development involves further research after receipt of order, preparation of a scope document to be approved by the customer and then engineering time to write, test and release the driver program.
When development of the driver is complete the customer is notified and can proceed with a FieldServer product.
Revenues for protocol driver development are recognized at a point in time when the control of the product is transferred to the customer generally occurring upon shipment or delivery of the related product that includes the developed protocol drivers (as noted in FieldServer Products above).
Discounts and Allowances 



Discounts are applied at time of order entry and sales are processed at net pricing.
No allowances are offered to customers.
c) Warranty 



The Company provides a warranty on all products sold for a period of two years after the date of shipment.
Warranty issues are usually resolved with repair or replacement of the product.
This standard warranty is assurance type warranty and does not offer any services in addition to the assurance that the product will continue working as specified.
Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations in the arrangement.
Instead, estimated future warranty obligations related to products are provided by charges to condensed statements of operations in the period in which the related revenue is recognized.
Page 16 of 22 



d) Contract Balances 



The Company records accounts receivable when it has an unconditional right to consideration.
Contract liabilities are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance.
Contract liabilities consist of only advance payments, where the Company has unsatisfied performance obligations.
At times, billing may occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in an unbilled receivable which represents a contract asset.
The Company does not have any unbilled receivable on the condensed balance sheets.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Payment terms vary by customer.
The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant.
For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before the products or services are delivered to the customer.
There were no significant changes in estimates during the period that would affect the contract balances.
The amounts of revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 from the opening deferred revenue balances were $32,059 and $8,167, respectively.
For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2018, and September 30, 2017 no impairment losses related to contract balances were recognized in the condensed statement of operations.
e) Disaggregation of Revenue 



In the following table, net sales are disaggregated by geographic region.
The Company conducts business across 5 geographic regions: United States & Canada, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Asia.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



f) Shipping and Handling 



The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the associated products.
g) Remaining Performance Obligations 



Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to performances obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period.
As of September 30, 2018, the remaining performance obligation is approximately $4,693,000, 51% or $2,409,000 of which is expected to be recognized in 3 months and 21% or $998,000 of which is expected to be recognized in the next fiscal year.
The remainder is expected to be recognized after fiscal year 2019.
Our international sales are generally made based on secure payment terms including cash wire advance payments and letters of credit.
International sales are made on open account terms where sufficient historical experience justifies the assumption of customer credit risk.
In many of our larger sales, our customers are frequently construction contractors who are in need of our field services to complete their work and obtain payment.
Management’s ability to manage the credit terms and utilize the leverage provided by the clients’ need for our services is critical to the effective application of credit terms and minimization of accounts receivable losses.
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is analyzed on a periodic basis to determine adequacy.
We believe that we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience.
We use an Enterprise Requirements Planning (“ERP”) software system which provides data upon which management relies to determine inventory trends and identify excesses.
We evaluate the carrying value of inventory quarterly.
The adequacy of carrying amounts is dependent upon management’s ability to forecast demands accurately, manage product changes efficiently, and interpret the data provided by the ERP system.
