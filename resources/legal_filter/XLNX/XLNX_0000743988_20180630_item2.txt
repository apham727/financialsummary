Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Net Revenues
•Advanced Products include our most recent product offerings and consist of the UltraScale+, UltraScale and 7-series product families.
•Core Products consist of all other product families.
These product categories are modified on a periodic basis to better reflect the maturity of the products and advances in technology. The most recent modification was made on April 3, 2016, which was the beginning of our fiscal 2017, whereby we reclassified our product categories to be consistent with how these categories are analyzed and reviewed internally. Specifically, we are grouping the products manufactured at the 28 nanometer (nm), 20nm and 16nm nodes into a category named Advanced Products while all other products are grouped in a category named Core Products. 
No end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Net Revenues by Product
Net Revenues by End Markets
Net revenues from Data Center and TME increased, in terms of absolute dollar, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher sales from Data Center, but was partially offset by a decrease in sales from TME. 
Net revenues from Automotive, Broadcast and Consumer increased, in terms of absolute dollar, in the first three months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year period. The increase was due to higher sales from all sub-segments, in particular from automotive and Audio, Video and Broadcast.
Net revenues from Communications decreased in the first three months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales from Wireless, and to a lesser extent from Wireline business. 
Net Revenues by Geography
Net revenues in Europe increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher sales from Industrial, Scientific and Medical and Data Center, but was partially offset by decline in sales from Wireless and TME. 
Net revenues in Japan increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year period. The increase was due to higher sales from Automotive. 
Gross Margin 
Gross margin was higher by 1.5 percentage points in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year period. The increase was driven primarily by manufacturing cost reduction in our Advanced Products and favorable changes in the end market mix. 
Research and Development
Selling, General and Administrative
Amortization expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased slightly from the comparable prior year period as certain acquisition-related intangibles have been fully amortized and there was no new major addition to acquisition related intangibles in recent years. 
Stock-Based Compensation
The 11% increase in stock-based compensation expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year period was primarily related to higher expenses associated with RSUs, as we granted RSUs at a higher fair value than in the prior years.
Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net
Our net interest and other income (expense) was a net other expense of $2.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, as compared to a net other income of $1.8 million in the same prior year period. The net reduction was due to unrealized losses on equity-type security investments during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, which was partially offset by higher income from the investment portfolio. 
The increase in the effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the same prior year period was primarily due to the new tax on low-taxed income from foreign subsidiaries and a decrease in excess tax benefits with respect to stock-based compensation. The increase was partially offset by a significant reduction in the amount of deferred tax accrued on foreign earnings not considered to be permanently reinvested.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have historically used a combination of cash flows from operations and equity as well as debt financing to support ongoing business activities, acquire or invest in critical or complementary technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our common stock and debentures under our repurchase program, pay dividends and finance working capital. Additionally, our investments in debt securities are liquid and available for future business needs.
The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments as of June 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018 totaled $3.46 billion and $3.55 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.36 billion and working capital of $3.18 billion. As of March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.45 billion and working capital was $3.24 billion.
Operating Activities —During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, our operations generated net positive cash flow of $176.2 million, which was $14.7 million lower than the $190.9 million generated during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The positive cash flow from operations generated during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily from net income as adjusted for non-cash related items, increases in income tax payable and accounts payable. These items were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories and a decrease in accrued liabilities. Accounts receivable increased by $74.7 million and days sales outstanding increased to 61 days at June 30, 2018 from 55 days at March 31, 2018. We had no collectibility issues and our accounts receivable remained current as of June 30, 2018. We expect our accounts receivable to be relatively higher than normal on a temporary basis as we partner with our distributors to manage their inventory requirements. Our inventory levels as of June 30, 2018 were $10.9 million higher at $247.0 million compared to $236.1 million at March 31, 2018, but the combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution decreased to 113 days at June 30, 2018 from 117 days at March 31, 2018. 
Investing Activities —Net cash used in investing activities was $444.2 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, as compared to $232.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Net cash used in investing activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of $403.9 million of net purchases of available-for-sale securities and $26.4 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment and other intangibles and $13.9 million of other investing activities.
We lease some of our facilities, office buildings and land under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through April 2029. See "Note 15. Commitments" to our condensed consolidated financial statements, included in Part I. "Financial Information," for a schedule of our operating lease commitments as of June 30, 2018 and additional information about operating leases.
As of June 30, 2018, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
Cash generated from operations is used as our primary source of liquidity and capital resources. Our investment portfolio is also available for future cash requirements as is our $400.0 million revolving credit facility entered into in December 2016 (expiring in December 2021). We are not aware of any lack of access to the revolving credit facility; however, we can provide no assurance that access to the revolving credit facility will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. Our revolving credit facility is not reliant upon a single bank. There have been no borrowings to date under our existing revolving credit facility.
Item 2.Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On May 16, 2016, the Board authorized 2016 Repurchase Program to repurchase of up to $1.00 billion of shares of our common stock and debentures. The 2016 Repurchase Program has no stated expiration date. Through June 30, 2018, we have used $929.4 million of the $1.00 billion authorized under the 2016 Repurchase Program, leaving $70.6 million available for future purchases. On May 16, 2018, the Board authorized 2018 Repurchase Program to repurchase the Company's common stock and debentures up to $500.0 million. 
Items 3, 4 and 5 are not applicable and have been omitted.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
