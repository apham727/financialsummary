Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Net Revenues
•Advanced Products include our most recent product offerings and consist of the Alveo branded boards, UltraScale+, UltraScale and 7-series product families.
•Core Products consist of all other product families.
No end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019.
Net Revenues by Product
Net revenues from Core Products also increased in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were largely due to higher sales from our Spartan 6 and Virtex 2 product families, which more 
Net Revenues by End Markets
Net revenues from Data Center and TME increased, in terms of absolute dollar, in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to higher sales from Data Center, which more than offset the decreases in sales from TME. 
Net revenues from Automotive, Broadcast and Consumer increased, in terms of absolute dollar, in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were due to higher sales from all sub-segments, with particular strength coming from Automotive and Audio, Video and Broadcast.
Net revenues from Communications increased, in terms of absolute dollar, in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to higher sales from all sub-segments, with particular strength coming from Wireless business driven by both the continued deployment of 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks and the ramping up global deployment of 5G wireless networks.
Net Revenues by Geography
Net revenues in North America increased in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to higher sales from Wireline and Data Center, which more than offset the decline in revenue from TME and Aerospace and Defense in both periods. 
Net revenues in Asia Pacific increased in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were due to a broad-based increase in sales from most of our end markets, in particular the Wireless business driven by the continued deployment of 4G LTE networks and the ramping up deployment of 5G wireless networks, and to a lesser extent from Data Center. 
Net revenues in Europe increased in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to higher sales from TME and Automotive. 
Net revenues in Japan increased in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods. Revenue from TME, Consumer and Data Center increased for both periods, but the increases were partially offset by lower sales from Wireless. 
Gross Margin 
Gross margin was lower by 1.3 and 0.5 percentage points in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 from the comparable prior year periods, respectively. The decreases were driven primarily by changes in the end-market mix, as revenue from Wireless, which has a relatively lower margin, increased more significantly as compared to the increases in the other end-markets. 
Research and Development
Selling, General and Administrative
Amortization expense for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased from the comparable prior year periods. The increase was primarily due to additional amortization expense from intangible assets acquired through the Deephi Tech acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. 
Stock-Based Compensation
The 5% and 4% increase in stock-based compensation expense for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2019, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, were primarily related to higher expenses associated with the recent RSU grants that had higher fair value than in the prior years. 
Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net
Our interest and other income (expense), net, was a net expense of $1.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to a net income in the comparable prior year period, a decrease of $6.8 million. For the first nine months of fiscal 2019, our net interest and other income decreased by $6.9 million as compared to the same prior year period. These decreases were primarily due to the losses from investments recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2019. 
ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment. However, the SEC staff issued SAB 118 which allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. The FASB allows taxpayers to make an accounting policy election of either (1) treating taxes due on GILTI inclusions as a current-period expense when incurred or (2) recognizing deferred taxes for temporary basis differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI in future years. During the period ended December 29, 2018, the last period covered by SAB 118, we recognized a measurement period adjustment that resulted in a reduction of tax expense of $6.9 million. The adjustment results from our election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences on GILTI. See "Note 14. Income Taxes" to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. "Financial Statements." 
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have historically used a combination of cash flows from operations and equity as well as debt financing to support ongoing business activities, acquire or invest in critical or complementary technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our common stock and debentures under our repurchase program, pay dividends and finance working capital. Additionally, our investments in debt securities are liquid and available for future business needs.
The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments as of December 29, 2018 and March 31, 2018 totaled $3.55 billion and $3.55 billion, respectively. As of December 29, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.47 billion and working capital of $3.22 billion. As of March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.45 billion and working capital was $3.24 billion.
Operating Activities —During the first nine months of fiscal 2019, our operations generated net positive cash flow of $803.2 million, which was $225.5 million higher than the $577.7 million generated during the first nine months of fiscal 2018. The positive cash flow from operations generated during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was primarily from net income as adjusted for non-cash related items, increases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable and decreases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets. These items were partially offset by increases in inventories and other assets as well as decrease in income tax payable. Accounts receivable decreased by $22.9 million and days sales outstanding decreased to 44 days at December 29, 2018 from 56 days at March 31, 2018. We had no collectibility issues and our accounts receivable remained current as of December 29, 2018. We expect our accounts receivable to fluctuate as we partner with our distributors to manage their inventory requirements. Our inventory levels as of December 29, 2018 were $47.2 million higher at $283.3 million compared to $236.1 million at March 31, 2018 to support our revenue growth, while the combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution decreased slightly to 118 days at December 29, 2018 from 119 days at March 31, 2018. 
Investing Activities —Net cash used in investing activities was $591.5 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2019, as compared to $318.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of $233.9 million for Deephi acquisition, $60.8 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment and other intangibles, $259.2 million of net purchases of available-for-sale securities and $37.6 million of other investing activities.
We lease some of our facilities, office buildings and land under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through April 2029. See "Note 15. Commitments" to our condensed consolidated financial statements, included in Part I. "Financial Information," for a schedule of our operating lease commitments as of December 29, 2018 and additional information about operating leases.
As of December 29, 2018, we had $489.4 million of liabilities classified as long-term income taxes payable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Of the $489.4 million, $468.3 million was the estimated long-term portion of the one-time transition tax that resulted from the enactment of the TCJA, which is payable in eight annual installments. The first installment was paid in 
As of December 29, 2018, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
Cash generated from operations is used as our primary source of liquidity and capital resources. Our investment portfolio is also available for future cash requirements as is our $400.0 million revolving credit facility entered into in December 2016 (expiring in December 2021). We are not aware of any lack of access to the revolving credit facility; however, we can provide no assurance that access to the revolving credit facility will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. Our revolving credit facility is not reliant upon a single bank. There have been no borrowings to date under our existing revolving credit facility.
