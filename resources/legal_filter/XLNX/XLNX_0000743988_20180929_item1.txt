The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, and should be read in conjunction with the Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx or the Company) consolidated financial statements filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. The interim financial statements are unaudited, but reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, of a normal, recurring nature necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim periods shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 30, 2019 or any future period.
The Company uses a 52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31. Fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 are both 52-week years ending on March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. The quarters ended September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 each consisted of 13 weeks.
Note 2.Recent Accounting Changes and Accounting Pronouncements
Revenue Recognition
In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued the authoritative guidance, as amended, that outlines a new revenue recognition standard that replaces virtually all existing U.S. GAAP guidance on contracts with customers and the related other assets and deferred costs. The authoritative guidance provides a five-step process for recognizing revenue that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled, in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (Full Retrospective), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. The Company adopted the new guidance on April 1, 2018, using the Full Retrospective method and restated the comparative prior periods. The Company implemented internal controls and certain system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption.
Revenue from sales to the Company's distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in) and is reduced by estimated allowances for distributor price adjustments and rights of return. Previously, revenue was recognized upon reported resale of the product by the distributors to their customers (sell-through) as reduced by actual allowances for distributor price adjustments. Revenue from software license agreements, software license renewals, and other contracts are recognized at point of sales, whereas previously these were deferred and recognized over the contractual term before the implementation of the authoritative guidance. Revenue recognition related to the Company's other revenue streams, such as direct customers, remains unchanged. 
In January 2016, the FASB issued final authoritative guidance regarding how companies measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method and how they present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option that are attributable to their own credit. The authoritative guidance also changes certain disclosure requirements and other aspects of current U.S. GAAP on this matter. The authoritative guidance does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans. The authoritative guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted this authoritative guidance on April 1, 2018 and recorded the balance of the unrealized losses of $11.0 million as of the end of fiscal 2018 from its investment in debt mutual funds and equity securities to retained earnings, less the related deferred taxes of $2.6 million. Subsequent changes in fair value from such investments are recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of income.
In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on income taxes which eliminates the deferred tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers other than inventory. As a result, a reporting entity would recognize the tax expense from the sale of an asset in the seller’s tax jurisdiction when the transfer occurs, even though the pre-tax effects of that transaction are eliminated in consolidation. The authoritative guidance is effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and requires the adoption be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. The Company adopted this authoritative guidance on April 1, 2018. Accordingly, $13.8 million of prepaid taxes associated with prior period intra-entity asset transfers was reclassified to retained earnings. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on leases. The new authoritative guidance requires the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet and will also require significant additional disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows from leases. Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation. The new authoritative guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, which for Xilinx would be the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The new authoritative guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition with application of the new authoritative guidance for leases that existed at or are entered after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. To help with the transition to the new guidance, certain practical expedients are provided. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new authoritative guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
On July 30, 2018, The FASB provided entities with an additional (and optional) transition method to adopt the new lease requirements by allowing entities to initially apply the requirements by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Consequently, an entity’s reporting for the comparative periods presented in the financial statements in which the entity adopts the new lease requirements would continue to be in accordance with current GAAP. An entity electing this additional (and optional) transition method must provide the required disclosures for all periods that continue to be in accordance with current GAAP. The amendments do not change the existing disclosure requirements in current GAAP. The amendments have the same effective date as the new leases standard, which for Xilinx would be the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new authoritative guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
Cloud Computing Arrangements
On August 29, 2018, the FASB issued new guidance requiring a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (i.e., hosting arrangement) that is a service contract to follow the internal-use software guidance to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as assets or expense as incurred. Capitalized implementation costs related to a hosting arrangement that is a service contract will be amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement, beginning when the module or component of the hosting arrangement is ready for its intended use. Entities will need to maintain appropriate records to capture the portion of their costs that qualify for capitalization. For public entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, which for Xilinx would be the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. Entities have the option to apply the guidance prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new authoritative guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
Note 3.Significant Customers and Concentrations of Credit Risk
Avnet, Inc. (Avnet), one of the Company’s distributors, distributes the Company’s products worldwide. As of September 29, 2018 and March 31, 2018, Avnet accounted for 50% and 61% of the Company’s total net accounts receivable, respectively. The Company expects its accounts receivable to fluctuate as the Company partners with its distributors to manage their inventory requirements.
 For the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, resale of product through Avnet accounted for 46% and 48% of the Company's worldwide net revenues, respectively. For the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, resale of product through Avnet accounted for 46% and 43% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues, respectively. 
Xilinx is subject to concentrations of credit risk primarily in its trade accounts receivable and investments in debt securities to the extent of the amounts recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company attempts to mitigate the concentration 
of credit risk in its trade receivables through its credit evaluation process, collection terms, distributor sales to diverse end customers and through geographical dispersion of sales. Xilinx generally does not require collateral for receivables from its end customers or distributors.
No end customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019 and 2018.
The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements established by the FASB defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which Xilinx would transact. The Company also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.
Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
The Company’s Level 1 assets consist of U.S. government securities, money market funds and marketable equity securities.
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
The Company’s Level 2 assets consist of financial institution securities, non-financial institution securities, U.S. agency securities, foreign government and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, debt mutual funds, asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities also include foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts.
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.
The Company has no Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
For certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash held in banks, accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities, and are therefore excluded from the fair value tables above.
The Company's $500.0 million principal amount of 2.125% notes due March 15, 2019 (2019 Notes) and $500.0 million principal amount of 3.000% notes due March 15, 2021 (2021 Notes) are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis for disclosure purposes. The fair values of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes as of September 29, 2018 were approximately $498.7 million and $495.2 million, respectively, based on the last trading price for the period (classified as Level 2 in fair value hierarchy due to relatively low trading volume). 
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
As of September 29, 2018, the Company had non-marketable equity securities in private companies of $53.8 million, which were classified as Level 3 assets. The Company’s investments in non-marketable securities of private companies, together with its non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and acquisition-related intangibles, are recorded at fair value only if the Company recognizes an impairment. The Company’s investments in non-marketable securities of private companies are also recorded at fair value if the Company recognizes an observable price adjustments. Such impairment losses or observable price adjustments were not material during all periods presented. 
Financial institution securities include securities issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper and time deposits. Substantially all time deposits were issued by institutions outside the U.S. as of September 29, 2018 and March 31, 2018.
As of September 29, 2018, the gross unrealized losses that had been outstanding for less than twelve months were primarily related to mortgage-backed securities due to the general rising of the interest-rate environment, although the percentage of such losses to the total estimated fair value of the mortgage-backed securities was relatively insignificant. The gross unrealized losses that had been outstanding for more than twelve months were primarily related to debt mutual funds and mortgage-backed securities, which were primarily due to the general rising of the interest-rate environment and foreign currency movement. 
Starting April 1, 2018, the Company records the change in the fair value of its investment in debt mutual funds and marketable equity securities as part of its interest and other income, net. This change in fair value was a net decrease of $73 thousand and $6.3 million for the three and six months ended September 29, 2018, respectively, and resulted in an expense within interest and other income, net for the period. 
The Company reviewed the investment portfolio and determined that the gross unrealized losses on these investments as of September 29, 2018 and March 31, 2018 were temporary in nature as evidenced by the fluctuations in the gross unrealized losses within the investment categories. These investments are highly rated by the credit rating agencies, there have been no defaults on any of these securities and the company has received interest payments as they become due. Therefore, the Company believes that it will be able to collect both principal and interest amount due to the Company. Additionally, in the past several years a portion of the Company's investment in the mortgage-backed securities was redeemed or prepaid by the debtors at par. Furthermore, the aggregate of individual unrealized losses that had been outstanding for twelve months or more was not significant as of September 29, 2018 and March 31, 2018. The Company neither intends to sell these investments nor concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that it will have to sell them until recovery of their carrying values. 
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable debt securities (financial institution securities, non-financial institution securities, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities), by contractual maturity, are shown in the table below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations without call or prepayment penalties.
As of September 29, 2018, $1.01 billion of marketable debt securities with contractual maturities of greater than one year were classified as short-term investments. Additionally, the above table does not include investments in money market, debt mutual funds and marketable equity securities because these investments do not have specific contractual maturities.
The cost of securities matured or sold is based on the specific identification method.
The Company’s primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. As a result of the use of derivative financial instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts may fail to meet their contractual obligations. The Company manages counterparty credit risk in derivative contracts by reviewing counterparty creditworthiness on a regular basis, establishing collateral requirement and limiting exposure to any single counterparty. The right of set-off that exists with certain transactions enables the Company to net amounts due to and from the counterparty, reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty default.
The Company entered into interest rate swap contracts with certain independent financial institutions to manage interest rate risks related to fixed interest rate expenses from its 2024 Notes and floating interest rate income from its investments in marketable debt securities. See “Note 10. Debt and Credit Facility” for more discussion related to interest rate swap contracts. The interest rate swap contracts were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the 2024 Notes and were separately accounted for as a derivative. The interest rate swap contracts and the 2024 Notes were initially measured at fair value. Any subsequent changes in fair values of the interest rate swap contracts and the 2024 Notes will be recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. During the six months ended September 29, 2018, the net change in fair values of the interest rate swap contracts and the underlying 2024 Notes was $13.3 million, which was recorded as a derivative liability for the interest rate swap contacts and as a reduction from the carrying amount of the 2024 Notes. There was no ineffectiveness during all periods presented.
Note 7. Stock-Based Compensation Plans
The Company’s equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term retention programs that cover employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company. These plans are intended to attract and retain talented employees, consultants and non-employee directors and to provide such persons with a proprietary interest in the Company.
Stock-Based Compensation
Employee Stock Option Plans
The types of awards allowed under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (2007 Equity Plan) include incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. To date, the Company has issued a mix of non-qualified stock options and RSUs under the 2007 Equity Plan; however, there was no issuance of stock options during the first six months of fiscal 2019 and the entire fiscal 2018. The Company's stock-based compensation expenses related to options during the first six months of fiscal 2019 and the number of options outstanding as of September 29, 2018 were not material. On August 1, 2018, the stockholders approved an amendment to increase the authorized number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2007 Equity Plan by 3.0 million shares. As of September 29, 2018, 11.6 million shares remained available for grant under the 2007 Equity Plan.
For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSU awards vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that the Company pays in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of the Company's employees. During the first six months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, the Company withheld $39.5 million and $42.1 million worth of RSU awards, respectively, to satisfy the employees’ tax obligations.
During the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2019, the Company realized excess tax benefits of $7.8 million 
and $8.7 million, respectively, primarily from RSU vesting. During the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company realized excess tax benefits of $6.3 million and $17.9 million, respectively. These tax benefits were recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of income as a component of the provision for income taxes.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The next scheduled purchase under the ESPP is in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. On August 1, 2018, the stockholders approved an amendment to increase the authorized number of shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP by 3.0 million shares. As of September 29, 2018, 12.0 million shares were available for future issuance under the ESPP. 
Note 8. Net Income Per Common Share
The total shares used in the denominator of the diluted net income per common share calculation include potentially dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding that are not included in basic net income per common share calculation. The diluted shares were calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the impact of the equity incentive plans, the incremental shares issuable assuming conversion of the Company's $600.0 million principal amount of 2.625% convertible notes issued in June 2010 (2017 Convertible Notes), before its maturity on June 15, 2017, and exercise of warrants on a weighted-average outstanding basis, before the final settlements during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The 2017 Convertible Notes matured during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and the Company exercised its call options to neutralize the dilutive effect of the incremental shares from the 2017 Convertible Notes. Because the number of diluted shares in the above table for the six months ended September 30, 2017 was calculated based on a weighted-average outstanding basis, it included approximately 3.0 million shares of dilutive impact from the 2017 Convertible Notes through the maturity date. Such impact will no longer be applicable in future periods.
Outstanding stock options and RSUs under the Company's stock award plans to purchase approximately 1.8 million and 3.0 million shares for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, were excluded from the diluted net income per common share calculation by applying the treasury stock method, as their inclusion would have been antidilutive. These options and RSUs could be dilutive in the future if the Company’s average share price increases and is greater than the combined exercise prices and the unamortized fair values of these options and RSUs.
On March 12, 2014, the Company issued the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes at a discounted price of 99.477% and 99.281% of par, respectively. Interest on the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15. 
The Company received net proceeds of $990.1 million from issuance of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes, after the debt discount and deduction of debt issuance costs. The debt discounts and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the terms of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes. As of September 29, 2018, the remaining term of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are 0.5 years and 2.5 years respectively.
On May 30, 2017, the Company issued the $750.0 million principal amount of 2.950% senior notes due June 1, 2024 (2024 Notes) at a discounted price of 99.887% of par. Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1. 
The Company received $745.2 million from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, after the debt discount and deduction of debt issuance costs. The debt discounts and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2024 Notes. As of September 29, 2018, the remaining term of the 2024 Notes is approximately 5.7 years.
In relation to the issuance of the 2024 Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts with certain independent financial institutions, whereby the Company pays on a semi-annual basis, a variable interest rate equal to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 91.43 bps, and receives on a semi-annual basis, interest income at a fixed interest rate of 2.950%. The Company incurred a net interest expense of $642 thousand and $1.5 million for the three and six months ended September 29, 2018, respectively, from the interest rate swap contracts, which was included in interest and other income (expense), net on the condensed consolidated statements of income. Net interest income of $1.5 million and $2.1 million was earned on the contracts for the three and six months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. As of September 29, 2018, the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was $42.3 million, which was recorded in other long-term liabilities. 
On December 7, 2016, the Company entered into a $400.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that, upon certain conditions, may be extended by an additional $150.0 million, with a syndicate of banks (expiring in December 2021). Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a benchmark rate plus an applicable margin based upon the Company’s credit rating. In connection with the credit facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial and nonfinancial covenants. As of September 29, 2018, the Company had made no borrowings under this credit facility and was not in violation of any of the covenants.
Note 11. Common Stock Repurchase Program
The Board of Directors (Board) has approved stock repurchase programs enabling the Company to repurchase its common stock in the open market or through negotiated transactions with independent financial institutions. On May 16, 2016, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1.00 billion of the Company's common stock and debentures (2016 Repurchase Program). The 2016 Repurchase Program has no stated expiration date. On May 16, 2018, the Board authorized the 2018 Repurchase Program to repurchase the Company's common stock and debentures up to $500.0 million (2018 Repurchase Program). 
Through September 29, 2018, the Company had used $952.7 million of the $1.00 billion authorized under the 2016 Repurchase Program, leaving $47.3 million available for future repurchases. The Company has not used any of the amount authorized under the 2018 Repurchase Program. The Company’s current policy is to retire all repurchased shares, and consequently, no treasury shares were held as of September 29, 2018 and March 31, 2018.
Note 12. Interest and Other Income, Net
Note 13. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss
The related tax effects of other comprehensive income (loss) were not material for all periods presented.
Note 14. Income Taxes
The Company recorded a tax provision of $23.4 million and $46.3 million for the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 9.8% and 10.2%, respectively. The Company recorded tax provisions of $20.3 million and $33.9 million for the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively, representing effective tax rates of 10.4% and 9.3%, respectively. The prior year amounts have been restated to reflect the retrospective application of the current authoritative guidance for revenue recognition. Refer to "Note 2. Recent Accounting Changes and Accounting Pronouncements" for additional detail.
The difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% and the Company's effective tax rate in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the favorable impact of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions, which was partially offset by the new tax on low-taxed income from foreign subsidiaries. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% and the Company’s effective tax rate in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions, for which no U.S. income tax had been provided, as the Company had intended to permanently reinvest the earnings outside of the U.S.
The Company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits for the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2019, determined in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance for measuring uncertain tax positions, increased by an immaterial amount to $126.1 million. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if realized in a future period, would favorably affect the effective tax rate was $16.1 million as of September 29, 2018. Another $85.5 million would increase additional paid-in capital. The $85.5 million relates to an additional deduction claimed on federal and state amended tax returns for fiscal 2014 for repurchase premium paid in that year in connection with the early redemption of the Company’s 3.125% Junior Convertible debenture due March 15, 2037. It is reasonably possible that changes to the Company's unrecognized tax benefits could be significant in the next twelve months due to tax audit settlements and lapses of statutes of limitation. As a result of uncertainties regarding tax audit settlements and their possible outcomes, an estimate of the range of increase or decrease that could occur in the next twelve months cannot be made.
The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities within the provision for income taxes on the condensed consolidated statements of income. The balance of accrued interest and penalties recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the amounts of interest and penalties included in the Company's provision for income taxes were not material for all periods presented.
Aggregate future rental income to be received, which includes rents from both owned and leased property, totaled $11.0 million as of September 29, 2018. Rent expense, net of rental income, under all operating leases was $816 thousand and $1.8 million for the three and six months ended September 29, 2018, respectively. Rent expense, net of rental income, under all operating leases was $900 thousand and $2.1 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. Rental income was not material for the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2019 or 2018.
The Company generally sells products with a limited warranty for product quality. The Company provides an accrual for known product issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and the end of fiscal 2018, the accrual balances of the product warranty liability were immaterial. 
The Company offers, subject to certain terms and conditions, to indemnify customers and distributors for costs and damages awarded against these parties in the event the Company’s hardware products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights or trademarks, and to compensate certain customers for limited specified costs they actually incur in the event the Company's hardware products experience epidemic failure. To a lesser extent, the Company may from time-to-time offer limited indemnification with respect to its software products. The terms and conditions of these indemnity obligations are limited by contract, which obligations are typically perpetual from the effective date of the agreement. The Company has historically received only a limited number of requests for indemnification under these provisions and has not made any significant payments pursuant to these provisions. The Company cannot estimate the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, that the Company may be required to make as a result of these obligations due to the limited history of indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will not incur any financial liabilities in the future as a result of these obligations.
Patent Litigation
The Company intends to continue to protect and defend its IP vigorously.
the action was withdrawn from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania and transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. On November 2, 2015, Xilinx, along with other defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On November 3, 2015, Xilinx filed a motion for sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. On June 27, 2016, the Court denied both motions. On September 11, 2017, Xilinx, along with other defendants, filed motions for summary judgment seeking to dispose of all claims against them. On July 3, 2018, the Court granted both of Xilinx’s Motions for Summary Judgment, disposing of all claims asserted against Xilinx. On August 1, 2018, the Trustee filed a Notice of Appeal. On August 9, 2018, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an Order to Show Cause requesting that the appellant address a possible jurisdictional defect. On August 29, 2018, the appellant responded to the Order to Show Cause. On September 10, 2018, the appellees, including Xilinx, filed a joint reply. The Court of Appeals has not issued a further order. 
From time to time, the Company is involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contract law, tax, regulatory, distribution arrangements, employee relations and other matters. Periodically, the Company reviews the status of each matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and a range of possible losses can be estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, the Company continues to reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise estimates.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
•timely completion of new product designs; 
•ability to generate new design opportunities and design wins; 
•availability of specialized field application engineering resources supporting demand creation and customer adoption of new products; 
•achieving acceptable yields; 
•ability to obtain adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors; 
•ability to obtain advanced packaging; 
•availability of supporting software design tools; 
•customer acceptance of advanced features in our new products; 
•ability of our customers to complete their product designs and bring them to market; and
•market acceptance of our customers' products. 
Most of our wafers are manufactured in Taiwan by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC). In addition, we also have wafers manufactured in South Korea by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. Terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined through periodic negotiations with these wafer foundries, which usually result in short-term agreements that do not provide for long-term supply or allocation commitments. We are dependent on these foundries to supply the substantial majority of our wafers. We rely on TSMC, UMC and our other foundries to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes. Therefore, the foundries, particularly TSMC who manufactures our newest products, must be able to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliver them in a timely manner. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that the foundries that supply our wafers will offer us competitive pricing terms or other commercial terms important to our business. 
We cannot guarantee that our foundries will not experience manufacturing problems, including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies or difficulties due to limitations of new and existing process technologies. For example, we may experience supply shortages due to the difficulties foundries may encounter if they must rapidly increase their production capacities from low utilization levels to high utilization levels because of an unexpected increase in demand. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that the foundries will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or that they will continue to manufacture a given product for the full life of the product. We could also experience supply shortages due to very strong demand for our products, or a surge in demand for semiconductors in general, which may lead to tightening of foundry capacity across the industry. In addition, weak economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of the foundries and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their commitments to us. The insolvency of a foundry or any significant manufacturing problem or insufficient foundry capacity would disrupt our operations and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes or other natural disasters such as typhoons, tsunamis, volcano eruptions, fires or floods, as well as disruptions in access to adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas or water. The independent foundries, upon which we rely to manufacture our products, as well as our California and Singapore facilities, are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters. TSMC's and UMC's foundries in Taiwan and our assembly and test partners in other regions as well as many of our operations in California are located in areas that have been seismically active in the past and some of these areas have also been affected by other natural disasters such as typhoons. Disruption of operations at these foundries and our facilities could cause delays in manufacturing and shipments of our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Any catastrophic event in these locations would disrupt our operations, and our insurance may not cover losses resulting from such disruptions of our operations, thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. For example, as a result of the March 2011 earthquake in Japan, production at the Seiko factory at Sakata was halted temporarily, impacting production of some of our older devices. In addition, suppliers of wafers and substrates were forced to halt production temporarily. Furthermore, natural disasters can also indirectly impact us. For example, our customers' supply of other complimentary products may be disrupted by a natural disaster and may cause them to delay orders of our products. More vertically-integrated competitors may be less exposed to some or all of these and other risks.
•product pricing; 
•product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density; 
•adaptability of products to specific applications; 
•inventory and supply chain management; 
•access to leading-edge process technology and assembly capacity; 
•access to advanced packaging technology.
Our strategy for expansion in the logic market includes continued introduction of new product architectures that address high-volume, low-cost and low-power applications as well as high-performance, high-density applications. However, we may not be successful in executing this strategy. In addition, we anticipate continued pressure from our customers to reduce prices, which may outpace our ability to lower the cost for established products. 
•high-density programmable logic products characterized by field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) type architectures; 
•high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs; 
•ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic; 
•high-speed, low-density complex programmable logic devices; 
•high-performance digital signal processing devices; 
•products with analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing capabilities;
•products with embedded processors; 
•products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers; 
•discrete general purpose GPUs targeting non-graphics applications; and 
•other new or emerging programmable logic products. 
If greater demand for wafers is not offset by an increase in foundry capacity, market demand for wafers or production and assembly materials increases, or if a supplier of our wafers or other materials ceases or suspends operations, our supply of wafers and other materials could become limited. Such shortages raise the likelihood of potential wafer price increases, wafer shortages or shortages in materials at production and test facilities, resulting in potential inability to address customer product demands in a timely manner. For example, in 2011, when certain suppliers located in Japan were forced to temporarily halt production as the result of a natural disaster, this resulted in a tightening of supply for those materials. Such shortages of wafers and materials as well as increases in wafer or materials prices could adversely affect our gross margins and would adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands and lead to reduced revenue. 
We are dependent on subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly, substrate, test and shipment services. Any (i) prolonged inability to obtain wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes, adequate yields or timely delivery, (ii) disruption in assembly, test or shipment services, (iii) delays in stabilizing manufacturing processes and ramping up volume for new products, (iv) transitions to new service providers, or (v) other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply, could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands. In addition, unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of these subcontractors and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their commitments to us. These factors would result in reduced net revenues and could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
A number of factors, including our inventory strategy, can impact our gross margins.
Our cash, short-term and long-term investments represent significant assets that may be subject to fluctuating or even negative returns depending upon interest rate movements, changes in credit rating and financial market conditions. Global credit market disruptions and economic slowdown and uncertainty have in the past negatively impacted the values of various types of investment and non-investment grade securities. The global credit and capital markets may again experience significant volatility and disruption due to instability in the global financial system, uncertainty related to global economic conditions and concerns regarding sovereign financial stability.
Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party IP. 
In the design and development of new products and product enhancements, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as software development tools and hardware testing tools. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties, including hardware and software tools and products. The design requirements necessary to meet future consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development tools that are available to us. In addition, hardware and software tools and products procured from third parties may contain design or manufacturing defects, including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our products. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable or fails to produce designs that meet consumer demands, our business could be adversely affected. 
We rely in part on various information technology (IT) systems to manage our operations, including, but not limited to, financial reporting, and we regularly evaluate these systems and make changes to improve them as necessary. Consequently, we periodically implement new, or upgrade or enhance existing, operational and IT systems, procedures and controls. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, could harm our ability to record and report financial, management, or operational information on a timely and accurate basis. In addition, hardware and software tools and products procured from third parties included in our IT systems could contain design or manufacturing defects, including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our IT systems. These systems are also subject to power and telecommunication outages or other general system failures. Failure of our IT systems or difficulties in managing them could result in business disruption. 
•we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products, and in general and administrative functions that support such products; 
We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may not operate effectively at all times and may result in a material weakness disclosure. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control, if any, could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements and could cause investors to lose confidence and our stock price to drop. 
We depend on the efforts and abilities of certain key members of management and other technical personnel. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain, develop and transition such personnel and attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, particularly product engineers. Competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining new or existing qualified personnel. Changes to the U.S. immigration laws may also impact the availability of qualified personnel. From time to time we have effected restructuring that eliminate a number of positions. Even if such personnel are not directly affected by the restructuring effort, such terminations can have a negative impact on morale and our ability to attract and hire new qualified personnel in the future. If we are unable to retain or develop existing qualified personnel or are unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. Further, changes to our qualified personnel, including key members of management, may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully assimilate key new hires, or to successfully retain, develop and transition promoted employees, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
In preparing our financial statements, we make good faith estimates and judgments that may change or turn out to be erroneous. 
Our failure to comply with the requirements of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR) could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Our FPGAs and related technologies are subject to EAR, which are administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. In addition, we may, from time to time, receive technical data from third parties that is subject to the ITAR, which are administered by the U.S. Department of State. EAR and ITAR govern the export and re-export of these FPGAs, the transfer of related technologies, whether in the U.S. or abroad, and the provision of services. We are required to maintain an internal compliance program and security infrastructure to meet EAR and ITAR requirements.
We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors which helps to ensure that products delivered to our customers are authentic and properly handled. From time to time, customers may purchase products bearing our name from the unauthorized "gray market." These parts may be counterfeit, salvaged or re-marked parts, or parts that have been altered, mishandled, or damaged. Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast supply or demand. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our authorized distributors may compete with brokers of these discounted products, which can adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our margins. In addition, our reputation with customers may be negatively impacted when gray market products bearing our name fail or are found to be substandard.
The conflict minerals provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act could result in additional costs and liabilities. 
In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC established disclosure and reporting requirements for companies whose products incorporate "conflict" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, regardless of whether such products are manufactured by those companies or by third parties. These requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our semiconductor products. The costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements include those for due diligence in regard to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. We may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all minerals used in our products through the due diligence process we implement. Moreover, some of our customers may require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict-free, and we may be unable to verify the origin of the raw materials used in our products to the extent necessary to make this certification.
As of September 29, 2018, we had 2.00 billion authorized common shares, of which 253.0 million shares were outstanding. In addition, 31.0 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans and Amended and Restated 1990 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan. The availability of substantial amounts of our common stock resulting from the exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity incentive plans, which would be dilutive to existing stockholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. 
We have indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.
The aggregate amount of our consolidated indebtedness as of September 29, 2018 was $1.75 billion (principal amount), which consists of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes due 2019 (2019 Notes), $500.0 million in aggregate 
•make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on the debentures and our other indebtedness;
•limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;
•limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;
•require us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;
•limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;
•increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions;
The agreements governing the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes contain covenants that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. 
•create certain liens on principal property or the capital stock of certain subsidiaries;
•enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal property; and
•consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all our assets, taken as a whole, to, another person. 
A failure to comply with these covenants and other provisions in these indentures could result in events of default under the indentures, which could permit acceleration of the 2019 Notes, the 2021 Notes and the 2024 Notes. Any required repayment as a result of such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
