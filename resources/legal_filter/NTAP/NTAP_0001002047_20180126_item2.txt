On November 3, 2017, we extinguished our 2.00% Senior Notes due December 2017 for an aggregate cash redemption price of $751 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  
On September 8, 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell certain land and buildings for a total of $306 million, through two separate and independent closings. On December 7, 2017, the first closing date, we consummated the sale of properties with a net book value of $66 million for cash proceeds of $210 million, resulting in a gain, net of direct selling costs, of $142 million.  
In fiscal 2016, we entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement of certain of our land and buildings. The arrangement did not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting and instead was accounted for as a financing transaction. In December 2017, we terminated the leases and recorded a non-cash sale of properties with a net book value of $54 million, the extinguishment of $130 million in financing obligations, and a gain of $76 million.  
Our fiscal year is reported as a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the last Friday in April. Fiscal years 2018 and 2017, ending April 27, 2018 and April 28, 2017, are each 52-week years, with 13 weeks in each of their quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in April and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. 
Net revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 were $1,523 million and $4,270 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of $119 million, or 8%, and $232 million, or 6%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, reflecting higher product revenues, partially offset by lower hardware maintenance and other services revenues. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased by one percentage point and one and a half percentage points, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal 2017, reflecting higher margins on product revenues. Gross profit margins on product revenues increased four and a half percentage points in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and four percentage points in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2017, primarily due to an increase in average selling price (ASP) and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  
Sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $688 million. This represented 45% of net revenues, consistent with the third quarter of fiscal 2017. In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses totaled $2,057 million, or 48% of net revenues, representing a decrease of two percentage points compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher net revenues in the current year coupled with lower average headcount as a result of our restructuring plans and other cost reduction initiatives. 
The increase in net revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in product revenues of $136 million and $296 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in hardware maintenance and other services revenues of $14 million and $52 million, respectively. Product revenues as a percentage of net revenues increased four and a half percentage points in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and four percentage points in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2017. 
Total product revenues from strategic solutions totaled $647 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 reflecting a 26% increase from $512 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 5% increase in unit volume of Clustered ONTAP systems and an increase in ASP driven by sales of our All-Flash FAS products. Total product revenue from mature solutions totaled $273 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, relatively flat compared to $272 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. A decrease in unit volume of 7-mode systems resulting from the movement of customer demand from older products to our newer products was offset by an 11% increase in add-on hardware, storage and related OS revenues. Product revenues from both strategic and mature solutions were favorably impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. 
Total product revenues from strategic solutions totaled $1,704 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 reflecting a 24% increase from $1,375 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 7% increase in unit volume of Clustered ONTAP systems and an increase in ASP driven by sales of our All-Flash FAS products. Total product revenue from  
mature solutions totaled $746 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 reflecting a 4% decrease from $779 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a 69% decrease in unit volume of 7-mode systems, and a 10% decrease in OEM revenues, partially offset by an 11% increase in add-on hardware, storage and related OS revenues.  
The fluctuations in software maintenance revenues reflect fluctuations in the aggregate contract value of the installed base under software maintenance contracts, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the terms of the underlying contracts.  
Hardware maintenance and other services revenues include hardware maintenance, professional services, and educational and training services revenues.  
Hardware maintenance contract revenues were $299 million and $903 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, compared to $313 million and $952 million for the corresponding periods of the prior year. The decreases in the current year were primarily due to lower contract renewal rates, and a decline in ASP on executed contracts.  
Professional services and educational and training services revenues were $67 million and $206 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, compared to $67 million and $209 million for the corresponding periods of the prior year.  
Americas revenues consist of sales to Americas commercial and U.S. public sector markets. Our geographic distribution of revenues as a percentage of net revenues was relatively consistent in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017. 
Cost of product revenues represented 51% of product revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to 55% and 54% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively. Materials costs represented 91% and 90% of product costs for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, compared to 90% and 91% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively. 
Materials costs increased $37 million and $57 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, primarily due to higher unit volume of Clustered ONTAP systems.  
Average unit materials costs for Clustered ONTAP systems increased slightly in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year. 
An increase in ASP for strategic systems resulted in higher margins for strategic products in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017. Margins in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were also favorably impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Margins for mature products were relatively consistent in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year. 
Cost of product revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were favorably impacted by a $5 million decrease in charges for excess and obsolete inventory. 
Cost of software maintenance revenues was relatively flat in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2017 and represented 3% of software maintenance revenues for all periods presented. 
Cost of hardware maintenance and other services revenues decreased $3 million, or 3%, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and decreased $33 million, or 9%, for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017, primarily due to the favorable impact of cost savings initiatives. Costs represented 30% of hardware maintenance and other services revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to 29% and 32% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively. 
Total compensation costs included in operating expenses increased by $26 million, or 7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense, reflecting stronger operating performance against goals, and, to a lesser extent, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  
Total compensation costs included in operating expenses decreased by $6 million, or 1% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding period in the prior year reflecting a decrease of 3% in average headcount, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. 
The increase in commissions expense reflects higher performance against sales goals, while the increase in compensation costs reflects a combination of higher average salaries due to merit increases, higher incentive compensation expense, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  
The increase in compensation costs for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was attributable to a 3% increase in average headcount and stronger operating performance against goals, which resulted in higher salaries, benefits and incentive compensation expense. Compensation costs for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 decreased slightly compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2017 due to slightly lower salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses resulting from a 4% decrease in average headcount. Development projects and outside services increased as a result of higher spending on materials and services associated with engineering activities to develop new products and enhance existing products. Depreciation expense decreased primarily due to certain equipment becoming fully depreciated by the end of fiscal 2017, and facilities and IT support costs decreased primarily due to cost containment efforts. 
Compensation costs for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased slightly compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2017 as a result of higher incentive compensation expense, partially offset by a slight decrease in average headcount. Compensation costs for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 were favorably impacted by lower salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2017 due to an 11% decrease in average headcount, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. The increase in professional and legal fees and outside services expense in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher spending levels on projects and outside services, while the increase in facilities and IT support costs was primarily due to an increase in spending on IT projects.  
On September 8, 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell certain properties previously classified as assets held-for-sale for a total of $306 million, through two separate and independent closings. On December 7, 2017, the date of the first closing, we consummated the sale of properties with a net book value of $66 million for cash proceeds of $210 million, resulting in a gain, net of direct selling costs, of $142 million.  
During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, our continuing involvement with properties subject to a sale-leaseback arrangement entered into in fiscal 2016 ended, and as a result we recorded a non-cash sale of properties, extinguished the associated financing obligation and recognized a gain of $76 million.  
Interest income increased in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year, primarily due to a shift in our investment portfolio to higher-yielding investments. 
Days sales outstanding, referred to as DSO, calculates the average collection period of our receivables. DSO is based on ending accounts receivable and net revenue for each period. DSO is calculated by dividing accounts receivable by average net revenue per day for the current quarter (91 days for each of the quarters presented above). The increase in DSO for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was due to differences in the timing of shipments to certain customers. 
Days inventory outstanding, referred to as DIO, measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our products. DIO is based on ending inventory and cost of revenues for each period. DIO is calculated by dividing ending inventory by average cost of revenues per day for the current quarter. DIO for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 due to lower levels of purchased components, primarily solid state drives, on hand at the end of the current quarter. Additionally, it decreased compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as a result of increased product sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.  
Days payables outstanding, referred to as DPO, calculates the average number of days our payables remain outstanding before payment. DPO is based on ending accounts payable and cost of revenues for each period. DPO is calculated by dividing accounts payable by average cost of revenues per day for the current quarter. DPO for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased compared to the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of improved vendor payables management and an extension of payment terms with our suppliers. 
Accounts payable increased $115 million, primarily due to improved vendor payables management and an extension of payment terms with our suppliers during fiscal 2018. 
Long-term taxes payable increased $723 million primarily due to a one-time transition tax liability recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result of the impact of U.S. tax reform, which will be paid over a period of eight years. 
During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we paid $178 million for the purchases of investments, net of maturities and sales, and paid $97 million for capital expenditures, while during the first nine months of fiscal 2017 we generated $2 million from maturities and sales of investments, net of purchases, and paid $137 million for capital expenditures. Additionally, during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we paid $75 million to acquire two privately-held companies, and received proceeds of $210 million from the sale of properties. 
Key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability, our ability to effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories, the timing and amount of stock repurchases and payment of cash dividends, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, our ability to effectively integrate acquired products, businesses and technologies and the timing of repayments of our debt. Based on past performance and our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of liquidity, including potential future issuances of debt, equity or other securities, will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on our debt and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions or enter into new financing arrangements. We cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all. 
Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, fund research and development, meet capital expenditure needs, invest in critical or complementary technologies, and service interest and principal payments on our debt. 
Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually. For further information on the underlying terms, see Note 9 – Financing Arrangements of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In connection with the Program, we have a senior unsecured credit agreement that expires on December 10, 2021. The credit agreement, which was amended on July 17, 2017 provides a $1.0 billion revolving unsecured credit facility that serves as a back-up for the Program. Proceeds from the facility may also be used for general corporate purposes, providing another potential source of liquidity to the extent that the credit facility exceeds the outstanding debt issued under the Program. The credit agreement also includes options that allow us to request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $300 million and to extend its maturity date for two additional one-year periods, both subject to certain conditions. As of January 26, 2018, we were in compliance with all associated covenants in this agreement. No amounts were drawn against this facility during any of the periods presented. 
On February 14, 2018, we declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock, payable on April 25, 2018 to holders of record as of the close of business on April 6, 2018. 
As of January 26, 2018, future annual minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year totaled $198 million.  
In addition to inventory commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers, we have open purchase orders and construction related obligations associated with our ordinary course of business for which we have not received goods or services. As of January 26, 2018, we had $15 million in construction related obligations and $222 million in other purchase obligations.  
In fiscal 2016, we entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement of certain of our land and buildings, under which we leased back certain of our properties rent free over lease terms ending at various dates through December 31, 2017. These properties did not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting and as a result they were accounted for as financing transactions. In December 2017, we terminated the leases and recorded a non-cash sale of properties with a net book value of $54 million, the extinguishment of $130 million in financing obligations, and a gain of $76 million. As of January 26, 2018, there are no balances remaining on our condensed consolidated balance sheets associated with this sale-leaseback arrangement.  
While most of our arrangements for sales include short-term payment terms, from time to time we provide long-term financing to creditworthy customers. We have generally sold receivables financed through these arrangements on a non-recourse basis to third party financing institutions within 10 days of the contracts’ dates of execution, and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. We account for the sales of these receivables as “true sales” as defined in the accounting standards on transfers of financial assets, as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we recognize product revenues for these arrangements, net of any payment discounts from financing transactions, upon product acceptance. We sold $62 million and $142 million of receivables during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. 
Some of the leasing arrangements described above have been financed on a recourse basis through third-party financing institutions. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default. These arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Where we provide a guarantee for recourse leases, we defer revenues subject to the industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance and recognize revenues for non-software deliverables in accordance with our multiple deliverable revenue arrangement policy. In connection with certain recourse financing arrangements, we receive advance payments associated with undelivered elements that are subject to customer refund rights. As of January 26, 2018 and April 28, 2017, the aggregate amount by which such contingencies exceeded the associated liabilities was not significant. To date, we have not experienced significant losses under our lease financing programs or other financing arrangements. 
We have entered into service contracts with certain of our end-user customers that are supported by third-party financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of our non-performance under the contract or our failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract or to pay the aggregate unpaid payments under such arrangements. As of January 26, 2018, we have not been required to make any payments under these arrangements, and we believe the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets or make payments under these arrangements is remote. The portion of the financial arrangement that represents unearned services revenue is included in deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business. See further details on such matters in Note 16 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
