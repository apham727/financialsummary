  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Revenue for the second quarter of the current year was $33.5 million, representing a slight decrease compared to the previous year second quarter revenue of $33.8 million.
Revenue through domestic channels for the second quarter of the current year was $20.6 million, an increase of 3.4% over the prior years second quarter.
International revenue for the second quarter of the current year was $12.9 million, a 7.3% decrease over the previous year second quarter, and represents 38.3% of AstroNovas second quarter revenue.
Current year second quarter international revenue includes an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.3 million.
Hardware revenue in the current quarter was $12.4 million, a 3.7% decrease compared to the prior years second quarter revenue of $12.9 million.
Supplies revenue in the current quarter was $18.1 million, a 1.1% increase over prior years second quarter supplies revenue of $17.9 million.
Service and other revenues of $3.0 million in the current quarter remained consistent with the prior year as increases in parts and repair revenue in the Product Identification segment were offset by declines in repair revenue related to the aerospace printer product line in the T&M segment.
Current year second quarter gross profit was $12.0 million, a 10.6% decrease compared to prior year second quarter gross profit of $13.4 million.
The Companys current quarter gross profit margin of 35.8% reflects a 3.8 percentage point decline from the prior years second quarter gross profit margin of 39.6%.
Current quarter general and administrative expenses were $2.6 million, a 6.8% decrease compared to $2.8 million in the prior years second quarter, as the current quarter decrease in professional services, employee benefits and employee fees were tempered by increases in wages and outside services.
Research and development (R&D) expenses were $1.8 million in the current quarter, a 12.0% decrease compared to $2.0 million in the prior years second quarter primarily due to decreases in wages and benefits.
The R&D spending as a percentage of revenue for the current quarter is 5.3% compared to 6.0% for the same period of the prior year.
Other expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was $0.2 million compared to $0.5 million in the second quarter of the prior year.
Current quarter other expense primarily includes interest expense on debt and the revolving line of credit of $0.2 million and foreign exchange loss of $0.1 million, which were partially offset by $0.1 million of other income.
Other expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 consists primarily of interest expense on debt of $0.2 million and foreign exchange loss of $0.3 million.
This compares to the prior years second quarter tax provision of $0.5 million, which reflects a benefit of $82 thousand related to windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock and an effective tax rate of 13.9%.
The Company reported net income of $1.0 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the second quarter of the current year.
On a comparable basis, net income for the prior years second quarter was $1.2 million or $0.17 per diluted share.
Return on revenue was 2.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to 3.5% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.

Revenue by product group and current period percentage change over the prior year for the six months ended August 3, 2019 and July 28, 2018 were:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Revenue for the first six months of the current year was $69.6 million, representing a 6.7% increase compared to the previous years first six months of revenue of $65.3 million.
Revenue through domestic channels for the first half of the current year was $42.6 million, an increase of 8.7% from prior year domestic revenue of $39.2 million.
International revenue for the first six months of the current year was $27.0 million, a 3.5% increase from the previous year international revenue of $26.1 million.
The current years first six months international revenue reflected an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.9 million.
Hardware revenue in the first six months of the current year was $25.4 million, a 1.9% increase compared to the prior years first six months of revenue of $24.9 million.
This increase is primarily due to the increase in sales of data acquisition recorders and aerospace printers in the T&M segment, slightly offset by a decline in hardware sales of aerospace printers related to the Honeywell Agreement entered into at the end of the third quarter of the prior year.
Also contributing to the growth in hardware revenue for the current year were sales resulting from the new product launch of the Quick Labels QL -300 printer as well as double-digit growth in sales of both Quick Label monochromatic printers and TrojanLabels T2-C printers in the Product Identification segment.
Supplies revenue in the first half of the current year was $37.8 million, representing a 9.3% increase over the prior years first six months revenue of $34.6 million.
The current year increase in supplies revenue is due primarily to the increase in inkjet printer supplies and labels sales, tempered by lower thermal film and electrophotographic supplies revenue in the Product Identification segment.
Service and other revenues were $6.4 million in the first six months of the current year, an 11.5% increase compared to the prior years first six months service and other revenues of $5.8 million.
The current year increase is primarily due to an increase in parts revenue related to the aerospace printer product line acquired from Honeywell in fiscal 2018.
Current year first six months gross profit was $26.2 million, a 2.8% increase from prior years first six months gross profit of $25.5 million.
The Companys gross profit margin of 37.6% in the current year reflects a decrease from the prior years first six months gross profit margin of 39.1%.
Selling and marketing expenses for the current year of $13.2 million increased 2.2% compared to the previous years first six months due primarily to an increase in wages, outside services, amortization of the Companys identifiable intangibles purchased in connection with the Honeywell Agreement, as well as increases in travel expenses, slightly offset by lower commissions and benefits.
General and Administrative (G&A) expenses increased 2.8% to $5.6 million in the first six months of the current year compared to the prior years first six months G&A expenses of $5.5 million primarily due to an increase in outside service fees, which was partially offset by a decrease in bonuses and share based compensation.
R&D spending in the first six months of the current year was $3.8 million, a slight increase compared to the prior years first six months spending of $3.7 million.
Current year spending on R&D represents 5.4% of revenue compared to the prior years first six months level of 5.7%.

The Company recognized $0.4 million of income tax expense for the first six months of the current fiscal year, which reflects a $232,000 tax benefit arising from windfall tax benefits related to the Companys stock and a $53,000 tax benefit related to the expiration of the statute of limitations on a previously uncertain tax position resulting in a 13.9% effective tax rate.
The Company recognized $0.6 million of income tax expense for the first six months of the prior fiscal year.
The Company reported net income of $2.7 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the first six months of the current year.
On a comparable basis, net income for the first six months of the prior year was $2.0 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, which included $0.8 million of after-tax income, or $0.12 per diluted share, as a result of a change in accounting estimates in the prior years first quarter for product cost and operating expenses related to a transition services agreement entered into with Honeywell in connection with the Honeywell Agreement.
In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, a change in accounting estimate for revenue subject to customer rebates under the Honeywell Agreement increased net income by $0.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share.

Table of Contents 



Revenues from the Product Identification segment increased 9.6% to $45.7 million in the first six months of the current year from $41.7 million in the same period of the prior year.
The current year increase is primarily attributable to an increase in supplies revenue of 11.4% due to increased demand for ink jet supplies, as well as label and tag products.
Also contributing to the increase in revenue for the current year was a 14.8% increase in service and other revenue.
Although hardware revenue in the PI segment remained constant compared to the prior year, the segment experienced a significant revenue contribution from the introduction of Quick Labels new QL -300 printer, as well as double-digit growth in revenue from sales of both Quick Labels monochromatic printers and TrojanLabels T2-C printers.
This growth was slightly tempered by lower sales of the inkjet color printers within the product group.
Product Identification current year segment operating profit was $5.1 million with a profit margin of 11.2%, compared to the prior year segment operating profit of $3.8 million and related profit margin of 9.2 %.

(the Lender), which, as amended, provides for a secured credit facility consisting of a term loan to ANI ApS in the principal amount of $9.2 million and a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million.
The Credit Agreement also provides for a $10.0 million revolving credit facility for the Company.
Both term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
25   



Table of Contents 



In connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement, ANI ApS entered into a hedging agreement to manage the variable interest rate risk and currency risk associated with its payments in respect to the term loan.
Under this combined arrangement, payments of principal and interest with respect to approximately $8.9 million of the principal of the term loan will be made in Danish Kroner, and interest on such principal amount will be payable at a fixed rate of 0.67% per annum for the entire term, subject only to potential changes based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
Additionally, the Company entered into a hedging agreement to manage the variable interest rate risk associated with its payments with respect to the $15.0 million term loan.
Under this combined arrangement, interest will be payable at a fixed rate of 2.04% per annum for the entire term, plus an incremental margin of 1.0% to 1.5%, based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
Revolving credit loans may be borrowed, at the Companys option, in U.S.
Dollars or, subject to certain conditions, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars or Danish Kroner.
Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, either (a) the LIBOR rate (or, in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in a currency other than U.S.
Dollars, the applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of Americas publicly announced prime rate or (iii) the LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.0% to 0.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility at the rate of 0.25% per annum.
Outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit line during fiscal 2020 bear interest at an average annual rate of 5.71% and the Company has paid $43,000 of interest expense for revolving credit line borrowings for the six months ended August 3, 2019.
The obligations of ANI ApS in respect of the $9.2 million term loan are guaranteed by the Company and TrojanLabel ApS.
The Companys obligations in respect of the $15.0 million term loan, revolving credit facility and its guarantee in respect of the ANI ApS term loan are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (including a pledge of a portion of the equity interests held by the Company in ANI ApS and the Companys wholly owned German subsidiary, AstroNova GmbH), subject to certain exceptions.
The Lender is entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans and to terminate its revolving credit commitment under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of various customary events of default.
The Parties must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.
As of August 3, 2019, the Company believes it is in compliance with all of the covenants in the Credit Agreement.
Cash Flow  



The Companys statements of cash flows for the six months ended August 3, 2019 and July 28, 2018 are included on page 7 of this report.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.0 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020 compared to cash used by operating activities of $1.7 million for the same period of the previous year.
The increase in net cash provided by operations for the first six months of the current year is primarily due to the increase in net income, and a decrease in cash used for working capital.
The accounts receivable balance decreased to $20.6 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $23.5 million at year end.
The $2.9 million decrease in the accounts receivable balance from year end is directly related to the decrease in sales for the second quarter of the current year as compared to fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2019.
The inventory balance was $36.9 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to $30.2 million at year end and inventory days on hand increased to 154 days at the end of the current quarter from 120 days at the prior year end.
Also contributing to the inventory increase were delayed shipments to customers in both the Product Identification and T&M segment.
The net decreased cash position at August 3, 2019 primarily resulted from principal payments of long-term debt and the guaranteed royalty obligation of $2.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively; cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $1.5 million and dividends paid of $1.0 million, offset by increased cash provided by operations as discussed above and the current period borrowing on the Companys existing revolving credit facility of $2.0 million.
