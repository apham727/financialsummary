Average MAUs decreased by 7 million, or 2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018. The sequential decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to minor decreases across franchises from less engaged users leaving the network. 
Average MAUs decreased by 39 million, or 10%, for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017. The year-over-year decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to decreases across Kings franchises from less engaged users leaving the network. King MAUs were also negatively impacted by technical system changes in the prior quarter made by some third-party partners in response to data initiatives, which inadvertently impacted some users ability to play and spend money in King games. The year-over-year decrease in Blizzards average MAUs is due to lower MAUs for Hearthstone and Overwatch. 
Managements Overview of Business Trends 
Interactive Entertainment and Mobile Gaming Growth 
Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry. Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry grew, on average, 18% from 2014 to 2017. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment. 
Further, the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on the mobile platform has increased the total addressable market for gaming significantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is estimated to be larger than both console and PC gaming and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from, our franchises. 
Opportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games 
As part of our efforts to take advantage of the esports opportunity, during 2017 we completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, which completed its inaugural season in July 2018. During 2018, we have completed the sale of eight additional teams, which are expected to compete in the leagues second season. 
Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises 
The top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. The top 10 console franchises in 2017 were all established franchises. Similarly, according to U.S. rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play store per App Annie Intelligence, as of December 2017, the top 10 mobile games have an average tenure of 22 months. 
Recurring Revenue Business Models 
Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more consistently recurring and year-round model. Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year. This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal than games developed primarily for the console or PC platforms.

Sources of Liquidity (amounts in millions) 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was $791 million, as compared to $1.06 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to changes in our working capital resulting from the timing of collections and payments. The decrease was partially offset by higher net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017. 
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was $160 million, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $163 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in the cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower purchases of available-for-sale investments of $59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $80 million in the prior-year period, partially offset by higher capital expenditures of $97 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $86 million in the prior-year period. 
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends. 
· lower proceeds from stock option exercises of $91 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $150 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017; 
· higher dividends paid of $259 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $226 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. 
Debt 
· on August 16, 2018, using available cash on hand, we redeemed the 2023 Notes in full at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes plus a make-whole premium calculated as set forth in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, resulting in a Loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in the condensed consolidated statement of operations of $33 million, comprised of premium payments of $25 million and a write-off of unamortized discount and financing costs of $8 million; 
· on August 24, 2018, using available cash on hand, we made a voluntary prepayment of $990 million to fully repay and extinguish the 2017 TLA resulting in a write-off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of $7 million, which is included in Loss on extinguishment of debt in the condensed consolidated statement of operations; and 
Dividends 
On February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.34 per common share. On May 9, 2018, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $259 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2018. 
For the year ending December 31, 2018, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $125 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, capital expenditures were $97 million.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
Revenue Recognition 
In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively. 
We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented. The application of this new standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. 
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018, there will be a significant impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the acquisition of King, and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 to complete the acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance will be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, will not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows. 
Derivatives and Hedging 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for its leases. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. When the new standard was initially issued, it was required to be adopted using a modified retrospective transition that required application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, subject to certain transition practical expedients available to provide relief in connection with the adoption. In July 2018, the FASB issued guidance to provide for an optional adoption method that allows companies to use the effective date of the new lease standard as the initial date of application on transition, and therefore does not require prior periods to be restated.
