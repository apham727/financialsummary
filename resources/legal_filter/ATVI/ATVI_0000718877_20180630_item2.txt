Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (PC), and mobile devices. We also operate esports events and leagues and create film and television content based on our intellectual property. The terms Activision Blizzard, the Company, we, us, and our are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. In connection with the 2008 business combination by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A. (Vivendi), and Vivendi Games, Inc., then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi, we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc. 
· the Activision Blizzard Distribution (Distribution) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware. 
· consolidated net revenues increased 1% to $1.64 billion, while consolidated operating income increased 28% to $434 million, as compared to consolidated net revenues of $1.63 billion and consolidated operating income of $339 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017; 
· revenues from digital online channels were $1.26 billion, or 77% of consolidated net revenues, as compared to $1.31 billion, or 80% of consolidated net revenues, for the three months ended June 30, 2017; 
· operating margin was 26.4%, as compared to 20.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2017; 
· diluted earnings per common share increased 63% to $0.52, as compared to $0.32 for the three months ended June 30, 2017.

The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. 
Q2 2018 vs. Q2 2017 
· lower net bookings from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016. 
· higher net bookings from the Candy Crush franchise due to increased monetization, primarily through in-game events and features.

· higher net bookings from the Candy Crush franchise due to increased monetization, primarily through in-game events and features. 
We monitor monthly active users (MAUs) as a key measure of the overall size of our user base. MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in the period. An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally be counted as a single user. 
Average MAUs decreased by 22 million, or 6%, for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018. The sequential decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to decreases across franchises and less engaged users leaving the network. The sequential decrease in Activisions average MAUs is due primarily to lower MAUs for the Call of Duty franchise. 
Average MAUs decreased by 55 million, or 14%, for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017. The year-over-year decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to decreases across Kings franchises due to less engaged users leaving the network. The year-over-year decrease in Blizzards average MAUs is due to lower MAUs for Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch. 
Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry. Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry grew, on average, 18% from 2014 to 2017. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment. 
Further, the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable market for gaming significantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is estimated to be larger than both console and PC gaming and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from, our franchises. 
As part of our efforts to take advantage of the esports opportunity, during 2017 we completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch LeagueTM, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, and we are nearing completion of the leagues inaugural season. 
The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry. According to The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 36% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2017. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games were responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch franchises, collectively, accounted for 66% of our consolidated net revenuesand a significantly higher percentage of our operating incomefor 2017. 
The top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. The top 10 console franchises in 2017 were all established franchises. Similarly, according to U.S. rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play store per App Annie Intelligence, as of December 2017, the top 10 mobile games have an average tenure of 22 months. 
Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more consistently recurring and year-round model. Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year. This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal.

YTD Q2 2018 vs. YTD Q2 2017 
The decrease in interest and other expense (income), net, for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017, was primarily due to a $23 million increase in interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and as the prior-year period included $12 million from the write-offs of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs associated with debt paydown activities that are not present in 2018. 
We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. In the near term, we expect our business and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, we believe, in combination with our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5.0 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $250 million revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months. Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as our anticipated dividend payments, share repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities. 
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions. 
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends. 
As of both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our total outstanding debt was $4.4 billion, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 3.69% and 3.58%, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, there was no activity associated with our debt instruments except for normal recurring interest payments. 
On July 17, 2018, we issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to the holders of all of our outstanding 2023 Notes. Accordingly, the 2023 Notes will be redeemed pursuant to their terms on August 16, 2018 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes plus a make-whole premium calculated as set forth in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes. Redemption of the 2023 Notes will result in a loss on extinguishment of approximately $35 million, comprised of premium payments of approximately $27 million and a write-off of unamortized discount and financing costs of approximately $8 million. As the irrevocable notice of redemption was issued subsequent to June 30, 2018, we presented the outstanding principal balance of the 2023 Notes and its related unamortized discount and deferred financing costs as Long-term debt, net on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2018. 
On February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.34 per common share. On May 9, 2018, we made an aggregate cash dividend payment of $259 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2018. 
For the year ending December 31, 2018, we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $140 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, capital expenditures were $61 million. 
As discussed in Note 2 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition and on January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments (collectively, the new revenue accounting standard), utilizing the modified retrospective method. Additionally, we elected to apply the new revenue accounting standard only to contracts not completed as of the adoption date. For contracts that were modified before the period of adoption, we elected to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications when (1) identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, (2) determining the transaction price, and (3) allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue accounting standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The cumulative effect adjustment recorded to our retained earnings at January 1, 2018 was $88 million. 
· The accounting for certain of our software licensing arrangements. While the impact of the new revenue accounting standard may differ on a contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms), the new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements. 
We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented. The application of this new standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. 
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018, there will be a significant impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the acquisition of King, and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 to complete the acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance will be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, will not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows. 
modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, with certain transition practical expedients available to provide relief in adopting the new standard. We are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements, but expect it to have a significant impact to our consolidated balance sheet as a result of establishing lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for our operating leases. We do not plan to early adopt this new standard but do expect to elect and apply the available transition practical expedients upon adoption.
