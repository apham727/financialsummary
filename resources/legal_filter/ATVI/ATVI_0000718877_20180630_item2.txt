Operating Metrics 
The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. 
Q2 2018 vs. Q2 2017 
· lower net bookings from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016. 
· higher net bookings from the Destiny franchise, driven by Destiny 2, which was released in September 2017, and its associated in-game content, with no comparable release in 2016; and 
· higher net bookings from the Candy Crush franchise due to increased monetization, primarily through in-game events and features. 
YTD Q2 2018 vs. YTD Q2 2017 
· higher net bookings from the Candy Crush franchise due to increased monetization, primarily through in-game events and features. 
· lower net bookings from Overwatch. 
Average MAUs decreased by 55 million, or 14%, for the three months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017. The year-over-year decrease in Kings average MAUs is due to decreases across Kings franchises due to less engaged users leaving the network. The year-over-year decrease in Blizzards average MAUs is due to lower MAUs for Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch. 
Managements Overview of Business Trends 
Interactive Entertainment and Mobile Gaming Growth 
Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry. Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and we estimate the total industry grew, on average, 18% from 2014 to 2017. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes more commonplace across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment. 
Further, the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable market for gaming significantly by introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is estimated to be larger than both console and PC gaming and continues to grow at a significant rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and drive additional player investment from, our franchises. 
Opportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games 
As part of our efforts to take advantage of the esports opportunity, during 2017 we completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch LeagueTM, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams, and we are nearing completion of the leagues inaugural season. 
Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises 
The top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. The top 10 console franchises in 2017 were all established franchises. Similarly, according to U.S. rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play store per App Annie Intelligence, as of December 2017, the top 10 mobile games have an average tenure of 22 months. 
Recurring Revenue Business Models 
Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a more consistently recurring and year-round model. Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the year. This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less seasonal.

Sources of Liquidity (amounts in millions) 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018, was $538 million, as compared to $676 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to changes in our working capital resulting from timing of collections and payments. The decrease was partially offset by higher net income for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017. 
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions. 
Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018, was $124 million, as compared net cash used in investing activities of $48 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in the cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchases of available-for-sale investments of $59 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, with no comparable transaction in the prior-year period. 
The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends. 
· lower proceeds from stock option exercises of $77 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $130 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017; 
· higher tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units of $68 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to $36 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017; and

Revenue Recognition 
In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. 
We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented. The application of this new standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. 
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018, there will be a significant impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the acquisition of King, and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 to complete the acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance will be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, will not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for its leases. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a
