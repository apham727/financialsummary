1. Description of Business and Basis of Consolidation and Presentation 
Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (PC), and mobile devices. We also operate esports events and leagues and create film and television content based on our intellectual property. The terms Activision Blizzard, the Company, we, us, and our are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. In connection with the 2008 business combination by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A. (Vivendi), and Vivendi Games, Inc., then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi, we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard replaces all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic, eliminating all industry-specific guidance and providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments (collectively, the new revenue accounting standard). As a result, we have updated our significant accounting policy disclosure for revenue recognition herein. Refer to Note 3 for the impact of adoption on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
Revenue Recognition 
· downloadable content, which provides players with additional in-game content to purchase following the purchase of a full game; 
· microtransactions, which typically provide relatively small pieces of additional in-game content or enhancements to gameplay; and 
· subscriptions to players in our World of Warcraft franchise, which provide continual access to the game content. 
· identifying the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 
· identifying the performance obligations in the contract;

Product Sales 
Products with Online Functionality 
Table of Contents 
For our online hosted software arrangements, such as titles for the Destiny, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush franchises, substantially all gameplay and functionality are obtained through our continuous hosting of the game content for the player. Similar to our software products with online functionality, these arrangements may include other products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations. Revenues related to online hosted software arrangements are generally recognized ratably over the estimated service period. 
Subscription revenue arrangements are mostly derived from World of Warcraft, which is playable through Blizzards servers and is generally sold on a subscription-only basis. Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then recognized ratably over the subscription period as the performance obligations are satisfied. 
Revenues attributable to the purchase of World of Warcraft software by our customers, including expansion packs, are classified as Product sales, whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and other in-game revenues are classified as Subscription, licensing, and other revenues. 
Licensing Revenues 
Other Revenues 
Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale of virtual currencies and goods to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from these sales of virtual currencies and goods are initially recorded in deferred revenue. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods purchased with a virtual currency. Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods directly are similarly recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods. We categorize our virtual goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed and our performance obligation is satisfied. Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the player and our performance obligation is satisfied, which is generally the estimated service period.

Significant Judgment around Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables 
We consider a variety of data points when determining the estimated service period for players of our games, including the weighted average number of days between players first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average number of days between players first purchase date and last date played online. We also consider known online trends, the service periods of our previously released games, and, to the extent publicly available, the service periods of our competitors games that are similar in nature to ours. We believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of services to our customers, as it is the best representation of the time period during which our customers play our games. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires managements judgment. Future usage patterns may differ from historical usage patterns, and therefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service periods for players of our current games are generally less than 12 months. 
· which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. 
Based on our evaluation of the above indicators, we report revenues on a gross basis for sales arrangements via the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, and we report revenues on a net basis (i.e., net of fees retained by the digital storefront) for sales arrangements via Microsofts Xbox Games Store and Sonys PSN.

· The accounting for certain of our software licensing arrangements. While the impact of the new revenue accounting standard may differ on a contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms), the new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements.

Adoption of the new revenue accounting standard had no impact to net cash from or used in operating, investing, or financing activities in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 
In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The new standard, among other things, generally requires companies to measure investments in other entities, except those accounted for under the equity method, at fair value and to recognize any changes in fair value in net income. The new standard also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and the guidance should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The guidance related to equity investments without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) is applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and it did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively. 
We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented. The application of this new standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. 
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018, there will be a significant impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the acquisition of King, and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 to complete the acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance will be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, will not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for its leases. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. When the new standard was initially issued, it was required to be adopted using a modified retrospective transition that required application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, subject to certain transition practical expedients available to provide relief in connection with the adoption. In July 2018, the FASB issued guidance to provide for an optional adoption method that allows companies to use the effective date of the new lease standard as the initial date of application on transition, and therefore does not require prior periods to be restated. 
In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if an entity forgoes a Step 0 test, an entity will be required to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit, as determined in Step 1 from the goodwill impairment test, with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge, if any, for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The effect of adoption should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

Cloud Computing Arrangements 
In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance related to a customers accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement (i.e. hosting arrangement) that is a service contract. The new guidance requires customers to capitalize implementation costs for these arrangements by applying the same criteria that is utilized for existing internal-use software guidance. The capitalized costs are required to be amortized over the associated term of the arrangement, generally on a straight-line basis, with amortization of these costs presented in the same financial statement line item as other costs associated with the arrangement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and can be applied retrospectively or prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements. 
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, inventory reserves were $23 million and $36 million, respectively.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, there were no impairment charges related to assets that are measured on a non-recurring basis. 
At December 31, 2017, we had outstanding term loans A of approximately $990 million (the 2017 TLA) and $250 million available under a revolving credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement entered into on October 11, 2013 (as amended thereafter and from time to time, the Credit Agreement). 
The New Revolver is scheduled to mature on August 24, 2023. Borrowings under the New Revolver will bear interest, at the Companys option, at either (1) a base rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate, plus 0.5%, (ii) the prime commercial lending rate of Bank of America, N.A. and (iii) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for an interest period of one month beginning on such day plus 1.00%, or (2) LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable interest margin. LIBOR will be subject to a floor of 0% and base rate will be subject to an effective floor of 1.00%. The applicable interest margin for borrowings under the New Revolver will range from 0.875% to 1.375% for LIBOR borrowings and from 0% to 0.375% for base rate borrowings and will be determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the Companys credit ratings. To date, we have not drawn on the New Revolver.

· $750 million of 6.125% unsecured senior notes due September 2023 that we issued on September 19, 2013 (the 2023 Notes), in a private offering made in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act); 
· $650 million of 2.3% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the 2021 Notes) and $850 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes due September 2026 (the 2026 Notes) that we initially issued on September 19, 2016, in a private offering made in accordance with Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act, and subsequently exchanged for publicly registered notes in June 2017; and 
· $400 million of 2.6% unsecured senior notes due June 2022 (the 2022 Notes), $400 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes due June 2027 (the 2027 Notes), and $400 million of 4.5% unsecured senior notes due June 2047 (the 2047 Notes, and together with the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the 2023 Notes, the 2026 Notes, and the 2027 Notes, the Notes), that we issued on May 26, 2017, in a public underwritten offering. 
On July 17, 2018, we issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to the holders of all of our outstanding 2023 Notes. Accordingly, on August 16, 2018, using available cash on hand, we redeemed the 2023 Notes in full at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes plus a make-whole premium calculated as set forth in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The redemption of the 2023 Notes resulted in a Loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in the condensed consolidated statement of operations of $33 million, comprised of premium payments of $25 million and a write-off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of $8 million. All other Notes referred to above remained outstanding as of September 30, 2018. 
The Notes are general senior obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment to all of the Companys existing and future senior indebtedness, including the New Revolver described above. The Notes are not secured and are effectively junior to any of the Companys existing and future indebtedness that is secured to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. We were in compliance with the terms of the Notes as of September 30, 2018. 
Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year for the 2021 Notes, the 2023 Notes, and the 2026 Notes, and payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year for the 2022 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2047 Notes. Accrued interest payable is recorded within Accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had accrued interest payable of $14 million and $28 million, respectively, related to the Notes.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, interest expense was $32 million and $113 million, respectively, and amortization of the debt discount and deferred financing costs were $1 million and $5 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, interest expense was $39 million and $110 million, respectively, and amortization of the debt discount and deferred financing costs were $2 million and $10 million, respectively.

On February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized repayment of up to $1.8 billion of the companys outstanding debt during 2018. As of September 30, 2018, we had utilized this entire authorization to repay our 2017 TLA and redeem our 2023 Notes, as described above. 
Using Level 2 inputs (i.e., observable market prices in less-than-active markets) at September 30, 2018, the carrying values of the 2021 Notes and the 2022 Notes approximated their fair values, as the interest rates were similar to the current rates at which we could borrow funds over the selected interest periods. At September 30, 2018, based on Level 2 inputs, the fair values of the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2047 Notes were $809 million, $379 million, and $380 million, respectively. 
Using Level 2 inputs at December 31, 2017, with the exception of the 2023 Notes and the 2047 Notes, the carrying values of our debt instruments approximated their fair values. At December 31, 2017, based on Level 2 inputs, the fair values of the 2023 Notes and the 2047 Notes were $795 million and $421 million, respectively.
