1. Description of Business and Basis of Consolidation and Presentation 
Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (PC), and mobile devices. We also operate esports events and leagues and create film and television content based on our intellectual property. The terms Activision Blizzard, the Company, we, us, and our are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
The Company was originally incorporated in California in 1979 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1992. In connection with the 2008 business combination by and among the Company (then known as Activision, Inc.), Vivendi S.A. (Vivendi), and Vivendi Games, Inc., then an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Vivendi, we were renamed Activision Blizzard, Inc. 
Our Segments 
As part of the continued implementation of our esports strategy, we instituted changes to our internal organization and reporting structure during 2017 such that the Major League Gaming (MLG) business operates as a division of Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. (Blizzard). Commencing with the second quarter of 2017, MLG, which was previously a separate operating segment, became a component of the Blizzard operating segment. MLG is responsible for the operations of the Overwatch League, along with other esports events, and will also continue to serve as a multi-platform network for other Activision Blizzard esports content. 
Blizzard is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the PC platform. Blizzard primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net®, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content, along with Activisions Destiny 2 PC content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content. As noted above, Blizzard also includes the activities of our MLG business, which is responsible for the operations of the Overwatch League, along with other esports events, and will also continue to serve as a multi-platform network for other Activision Blizzard esports content.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard replaces all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminates all industry-specific guidance, providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard and related amendments (the new revenue accounting standard). As a result, we have updated our significant accounting policy disclosure for revenue recognition herein. Refer to Note 3 for the impact of adoption on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
Revenue Recognition 
· downloadable content, which provides players with additional in-game content to purchase following the purchase of a full game; 
Table of Contents 
· microtransactions, which typically provide relatively small pieces of additional in-game content or enhancements to gameplay; and 
· subscriptions to players in our World of Warcraft franchise, which provide continual access to the game content. 
· identifying the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 
· identifying the performance obligations in the contract; 
· determining the transaction price; 
· allocating the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and 
Certain products are sold to customers with a street date (which is the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we recognize revenues on the later of the street date and the date the product is sold to our customer. For digital full-game downloads sold to customers, we recognize revenue when it is available for download or is activated for gameplay. Revenues are recorded net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed at the time of the specific revenue-producing transaction between us and our customer, such as sales and value-added taxes. 
Product Sales 
Table of Contents 
Products with Online Functionality 
For our online hosted software arrangements, such as titles for the Destiny, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush franchises, substantially all gameplay and functionality are obtained through our continuous hosting of the game content for the player. Similar to our software products with online functionality, these arrangements may include other products and services, which often results in the recognition of additional performance obligations. Revenues related to online hosted software arrangements are generally recognized ratably over the estimated service period. 
Subscription revenue arrangements are mostly derived from World of Warcraft, which is playable through Blizzards servers and is generally sold on a subscription-only basis. For World of Warcraft, after the first month of free usage that is included with the initial purchase of World of Warcraft software, the World of Warcraft end user may enter into a subscription agreement for additional future access. Revenues associated with the sales of subscriptions via initial software purchases and standalone subscriptions sales are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then recognized ratably over the subscription period as the performance obligations are satisfied. 
Licensing Revenues 
Table of Contents 
Other Revenues 
Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale of virtual currencies and goods to our players to enhance their gameplay experience. Proceeds from these sales of virtual currencies and goods are initially recorded in deferred revenue. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods purchased with a virtual currency. Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods directly are similarly recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods. We categorize our virtual goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed and our performance obligation is satisfied. Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the player and our performance obligation is satisfied, which is generally the estimated service period. 
Significant Judgment around Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables 
We consider a variety of data points when determining the estimated service period for players of our games, including the weighted average number of days between players first and last days played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average number of days between players first purchase date and last date played online. We also consider known online trends, the service periods of our previously released games, and, to the extent publicly available, the service periods of our competitors games that are similar in nature to ours. We believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of services to our customers, as it is the best representation of the time period during which our customers play our games. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires managements judgment. Future usage patterns may differ from historical usage patterns, and therefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service periods for players of our current games are generally less than 12 months.

· which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. 
Based on our evaluation of the above indicators, we report revenues on a gross basis for sales arrangements via Apple App Store and Google Play Store, and we report revenues on a net basis (i.e. net of fees retained by the digital storefront) for sales arrangements via Microsofts Xbox Games Store and Sonys PSN.

Revenue Recognition 
Table of Contents 
· The accounting for our sales of our games with significant online functionality for which we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) for unspecified future updates and ongoing online services provided. Under the prior accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements was required. This requirement was eliminated under the new revenue accounting standard. Accordingly, we are required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of this software, as compared to recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated service period as previously required. This difference in accounting primarily impacted revenues from our Call of Duty franchise, where approximately 20% of the sales price is now recognized as revenue upon delivery of the games to our customers. Many of our other franchises, such as Destiny, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, are online hosted arrangements, and the accounting for our sales of these games under the new standard is relatively unchanged; and 
· The accounting for certain of our software licensing arrangements. While the impacts of the new revenue accounting standard may differ on a contract-by-contract basis (as the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms), the new revenue accounting standard generally results in earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements.

Adoption of the new revenue accounting standard had no impact to net cash from or used in operating, investing, or financing activities in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 
In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The new standard, among other things, generally requires companies to measure investments in other entities, except those accounted for under the equity method, at fair value and to recognize any changes in fair value in net income. The new standard also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and the guidance should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The guidance related to equity investments without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) is applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption. We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and it did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with Cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. 
We adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2018 and applied the standard retrospectively for all periods presented. The application of this new standard did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. 
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018, there will be a significant impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December 31, 2015 to facilitate the acquisition of King, and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 to complete the acquisition. Under this new standard, the restricted cash balance will be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, will not be included as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for its leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs, lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, with certain transition practical expedients available to provide relief in adopting the new standard. We are evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements, but expect it to have a material impact to our consolidated balance sheet as a result of establishing lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for our operating leases. We do not plan to early adopt this new standard but do expect to elect and apply the available transition practical expedients upon adoption. 
In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance which eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if an entity forgoes a Step 0 test, an entity will be required to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit, as determined in Step 1 from the goodwill impairment test, with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge, if any, for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The effect of adoption should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
