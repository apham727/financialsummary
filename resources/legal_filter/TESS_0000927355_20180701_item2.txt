 Item 2.
We have operations and office facilities in Hunt Valley, Maryland, Reno, Nevada and San Antonio, Texas.
The Company evaluates its business within two segments: commercial and retail.
The commercial segment consists of the following customer markets: (1) public carriers, that are generally responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure system and provide airtime service to individual subscribers; (2) government, including federal agencies and state and local governments that run wireless networks for their own use, as well as value-added resellers who specialize in selling to the government; (3) private system operators, including commercial entities such as enterprise customers, major utilities and transportation companies; and (4) value-added resellers that sell, install and/or service cellular telephone, wireless networking, broadband and two-way radio communications equipment primarily for enterprise customers.
The retail segment consists of the retail market which includes retailers, independent dealer agents and carriers.
Base station infrastructure products are used to build, repair and upgrade wireless telecommunication systems.
Sales of traditional base station infrastructure products, such as base station radios, cable and transmission lines and antennas are in part dependent on capital spending in the wireless communications industry.
Network systems products are used to build and upgrade computing and internet networks.
We have also been growing our offering of wireless broadband, distributed antennas systems (DAS), network equipment, security and surveillance products, which are not as dependent on the overall capital spending of the industry.
Installation, test and maintenance products are used to install, tune, and maintain wireless communications equipment.
Mobile device accessories products include cellular phone and data device accessories.
Our first quarter fiscal 2019 revenue increased by 7.8% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
We experienced first quarter fiscal 2019 revenue growth within our commercial segments of 16.2% and a decrease in revenue in the retail segment of 7.9%, as compared to the first fiscal quarter of 2018.
The growth in our commercial segment was driven by increases in our public carrier, government and, private system operators markets.
For the retail segment, year over year, revenue declined due, in part, to the timing of two Samsung Galaxy phone launches.
The prior launch occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, while the most recent launch instead occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, contributing to a decline in year over year first quarter revenue.
On the product side, revenue increased in our base station infrastructure and our installation, test and maintenance categories by 25.8% and 6.3%, respectively.
Revenue decreased in our network systems and our mobile device accessories categories by 4.4% and 7.4%, respectively, for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the same quarter last year.
Our first quarter fiscal year 2019 gross profit increased by 5.3%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.
Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 3.9% compared to the prior-year quarter.
The new tax law that went into effect in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 resulted in a significantly lower tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
As a result of the factors discussed above, net income increased by 69.6% and diluted earnings per share increased by 62.5% compared to the prior-year quarter.
The terms, and accordingly the factors, applicable to each relationship often differ.
The wireless communications distribution industry is competitive and fragmented and is comprised of several national distributors.
In addition, many manufacturers sell direct.
We believe, however, that our strength in service, the breadth and depth of our product offering, our information technology system, industry experience and knowledge, and our large customer base and purchasing relationships with approximately 440 manufacturers, provide us with a significant competitive advantage over new entrants to the marketplace.

 First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2019 Compared with First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2018  



 Total Revenues.
Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 7.8% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Within our commercial segment, revenues in our public carrier market increased by 51.7%.
We also experienced revenue growth within our government and private system operators markets of 9.3% and 2.8%, respectively, over the prior year quarter.
The increase in revenue from our government market was primarily related to increased spending by government contractors related to state and local government fiscal year ends.
The increase in revenue for our private system operators is primarily driven by increases from manufacturing and mining customers.
Revenues in our value-added resellers market decreased slightly by 1.0%.
The growth in our commercial segment was partially offset by a decline in our retail segment of 7.9%, as compared to the first fiscal quarter of 2018.
The first fiscal quarter of 2018 included retail segment revenue associated with the introduction by Samsung of a new Galaxy phone.
This year, Samsung again introduced a new Galaxy phone, but did so earlier in the calendar year, leading to the receipt of a significant portion of related revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, instead of the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Total Gross Profit.
Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased by 5.2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Overall gross profit margin decreased slightly from 20.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 to 20.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
This decline was caused primarily by a change in product and customer mix, including a lower percentage of proprietary VentevÂ® sales as compared to the prior year period.
We continue to experience margin compression within the public carrier market because of changes in customer mix, including a higher percentage of sales to Tier 1 Carrier installers and contractors.
Agreements or arrangements on which these relationships are based typically do not include any obligation in respect of any specific product purchase or sale, are of limited duration, and are terminable by either party upon relatively short notice.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.
Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 19.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, to 19.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the increase in our information technology expense of $0.8 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
We continue to invest in our information technology infrastructure to support our sales initiatives.
We continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an

appropriate reserve based on this evaluation.
We incurred bad debt expense of $356,200 and $231,000 for the fiscal quarter ended July 1, 2018 and June 25, 2017, respectively.
Interest, Net.
Net interest expense increased from $68,600 for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 to $174,400 for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Increased focus on business opportunities for sales to our public carrier customers has required us to maintain increased inventory and accounts receivable levels, and at times has resulted in increased borrowings and interest expense under our Revolving Credit Facility (discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).
We expect this higher level of interest expense to continue for at least the next several quarters.
Income Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share.
The effective tax rate decreased from 43.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 to 25.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was lower primarily due to a change in tax law.
The annual federal rate has dropped from 35% to 21% due to the Tax Act.
As a result of the factors discussed above, net income increased 69.6% and diluted earnings per share increased 62.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the corresponding prior-year quarter.
Liquidity and Capital Resources  



 The following table summarizes our cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the three months ended July 1, 2018 and June 25, 2017.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 We used $1.7 million of net cash from operating activities for the first three months of fiscal 2019, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $14.1 million for the first three months of fiscal 2018.
This fiscal 2018 outflow was driven by an increase in accounts receivable and product inventory, partially offset by net income and an increase in accounts payable.
Accounts payable also increased in response to higher inventory levels.
As such, on October 19, 2017 we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as discussed below, based upon our anticipated borrowing and cash needs.
Net cash used in investing activities of $1.4 million for the first three months of fiscal 2019 was up from expenditures of $0.8 million for the first three months of fiscal 2018.
Cash used in both periods was due to capital expenditures largely comprised of investments in information technology.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.1 million for the first three months of fiscal 2019, compared to $6.6 million provided in the first three months of fiscal 2018.
During the first three months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, we utilized our asset based secured Revolving Credit Facility, leading to a cash inflow of $4.9 million

and $8.3 million, respectively.
During the first three months of each of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, we had cash outflows of $1.7 million due to cash dividends paid to shareholders.
On October 19, 2017, the Company and its primary operating subsidiaries, as co-borrowers, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the Companyâs primary lenders.
Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement for the secured Revolving Credit Facility previously established in June 2016, was amended and restated in order to, among other things, increase the Companyâs borrowing limit from up to $35 million to up to $75 million.
In addition to expanding the borrowing limit, the Amended and Restated Credit Facility extends the applicable maturity date to October 19, 2021.
As of July 1, 2018, we had a $15.8 million balance on the Revolving Credit Facility; therefore, we had $59.2 million available, subject to the Borrowing Base limitations and compliance with the other applicable terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the financial and other covenants discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
In connection with the entering into of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company and the other Company affiliate borrowers and subsidiaries, referred to collectively as the Loan Parties, executed and delivered to SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent, a Reaffirmation Agreement, pursuant to which the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Guaranty and Security Agreement delivered by the Loan Parties in connection with the secured credit facility as previously existing (including the previously existing guaranty by the Loan Parties not otherwise Borrowers and the previously existing grant by the Company and the other Loan Parties of a continuing first priority security interest in inventory, accounts receivable and deposit accounts, and on all documents, instruments, general intangibles, letter of credit rights, and all proceeds) were ratified and confirmed as respects the Obligations arising under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility from time to time.
On March 31, 2009, we entered into a term loan with the Baltimore County Economic Development Revolving Loan Fund for an aggregate principal amount of $250,000.
The term loan is payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest of $2,300, with the balance due at maturity on April 1, 2019.
The term loan bears interest at 2.00% per annum and is secured by a subordinate position on our Hunt Valley, Maryland facility.
At July 1, 2018, the principal balance of this term loan was $22,800.
We have made quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock since the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
Our most recent quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share was paid in June 2018.
On July 16, 2018, we declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.20 per share, payable on August 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of August 1, 2018.
Any future declaration of dividends and the establishment of any corresponding record and payment dates remains subject to further determination from time to time by the Board of Directors.
We believe that our existing cash, payments from customers and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to support our operations for at least the next twelve months.
To minimize interest expense, our policy is to apply excess available cash to reduce the balance outstanding from time to time on our Revolving Credit Facility.
Our increased focus over the past several quarters on business opportunities for sales to our public carrier customers led to the recent expansion of our Revolving Credit Facility, and has at times resulted in increased borrowings and dependence on that facility.
We expect this trend to continue, although at present we have no plans for any further expansion of the facility.
If we were to undertake an acquisition or other major capital purchases that require funds in excess of existing sources of liquidity, we would look to sources of funding from additional credit facilities, debt and/or equity issuances.
As of July 1, 2018, we do not have any material capital expenditure commitments.
