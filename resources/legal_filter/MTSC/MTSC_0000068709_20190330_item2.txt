MTS Systems Corporation's testing and simulation hardware, software and service solutions help customers accelerate and improve their design, development and manufacturing processes and are used for determining the mechanical behavior of materials, products and structures. Our high-performance sensors provide measurements of vibration, pressure, position, force and sound in a variety of applications. As of September 29, 2018, we had 3,400 employees and revenue of $778,032 for fiscal year 2018.
On November 21, 2018, we acquired E2M Technologies B.V. (E2M) for a cash purchase price of $80,287. We funded the acquisition of E2M through borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the acquisition of E2M. 
On November 21, 2018, we amended the Credit Agreement to increase the size of our Revolving Credit Facility from $120,000 to $150,000 and to extend the expiration date to July 5, 2022. The size of the Revolving Credit Facility was increased to finance the purchase of E2M. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the amendment to the Credit Agreement. 
In fiscal year 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), followed by related amendments (collectively, "the new revenue standard" or "ASC 606"). See Note 2 and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the impact of this adoption on our Consolidated Income Statements and Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The terms "MTS," "we," "us," "the Company" or "our" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, refer to MTS Systems Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
The following tables compare results of operations, separately identifying the estimated impact of currency translation, the acquisition of E2M in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and restructuring costs incurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. 
2 The Acquisition column includes revenues and costs from the acquisition of E2M and costs incurred as part of the acquisition of E2M. 
See Notes 3, 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the new revenue standard, restructuring and related costs, and the E2M acquisition, respectively. 
Selling and marketing expense for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 9.1% and 4.6%, respectively, primarily due to increased compensation and commissions expense to support sales growth and the addition of E2M expenses, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation and E2M expenses, selling and marketing expense increased 10.6% and 5.5%, respectively.
Interest expense, net for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased primarily due to an increase in interest expense on the revolving credit facility, which was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to lower balances on the tranche B term loan, as well as current year gains on interest rate swaps. 
The increase in other income (expense), net for the six months ended March 30, 2019 was primarily driven by a relative decrease in losses on foreign currency transactions. 
The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 30, 2019 was flat. 
The effective tax rate for the six months ended March 30, 2019 increased primarily due to certain discrete benefits of $25,378 in the prior year for the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The current year also includes a certain discrete tax benefit of $1,293 related to the Tax Act. Excluding the impact of these discrete benefits, the effective tax rate for the six months ended March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018 would have been 17.3% and 17.5%, respectively. 
Net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 30, 2019 increased primarily due to higher income from operations.
2 The Acquisition column includes revenues and costs from the acquisition of E2M and costs incurred as part of the acquisition of E2M. 
See Notes 3, 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the new revenue standard, restructuring and related costs, and the E2M acquisition, respectively. 
Revenue for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 37.0% and 21.1%, respectively, primarily driven by growth in equipment volume across all sectors from conversion of robust beginning-of-year backlog and strong current-year order volume and the acquisition of E2M in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation and the E2M acquisition, revenue increased 30.8% and 17.2%, respectively. 
Selling and marketing expense for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 16.0% and 6.4%, respectively, primarily due higher commissions and compensation expense, as well as the addition of E2M expenses, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation and E2M expenses, selling and marketing expense increased 16.5% and 6.6%, respectively.
Income from operations for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 284.9% and 124.8%, respectively, primarily due to increased gross profit on higher revenue volume and operational productivity, partially offset by higher compensation expense. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the E2M acquisition, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, income from operations increased 242.1% and 116.9%, respectively.
The following tables compare results of operations for Sensors, separately identifying the estimated impact of currency translation. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our reportable segments.
Revenue for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 1.0% and 1.8%, respectively, primarily driven by continued growth in the Sensors position sector from continued strength in industrial and mobile hydraulics markets and growth in the Sensors test sector from a multi-year contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, revenue increased 3.9% in both periods.
Selling and marketing expense for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 1.7% and 2.5%, respectively, primarily driven by increased compensation from headcount additions to support sales growth, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, selling and marketing expense increased 4.1% and 4.2%, respectively.
General and administrative expense for the three months ended March 30, 2019 increased 12.6% primarily driven by higher compensation expense. Excluding the impact of currency translation, general and administrative expense increased 13.6%.
General and administrative expense for the six months ended March 30, 2019 increased 3.2% primarily driven by higher professional fees and compensation expense. Excluding the impact of currency translation, general and administrative expense increased 3.9%. 
Income from operations for the three and six months ended March 30, 2019 declined 13.7% and 8.6%, respectively, primarily due to increased compensation expense and the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, income from operations decreased 9.7% and 5.7%, respectively.
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash used by working capital associated with timing fluctuations from accounts receivable payments received and unbilled accounts receivable accruals, accounts payable payments, inventory purchases, and advanced payments received from customers, as well as a decrease in net income due to the remeasurement of our estimated deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Act in fiscal year 2018. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in cash used by deferred income taxes, an increase in cash provided by other assets and liabilities related to accrued project costs, and a decrease in cash used by payroll-related accruals.
We had cash and cash equivalents of $74,122 as of March 30, 2019. Of this amount, $10,597 was located in North America, $28,847 in Europe and $34,678 in Asia. Repatriation of certain foreign earnings is restricted by local law. The North American cash balance was primarily invested in bank deposits. The cash balances in Europe and Asia were primarily invested in money market funds and bank deposits. In accordance with our investment policy, we place cash equivalent investments with issuers who have high-quality investment credit ratings. In addition, we limit the amount of investment exposure we have with any particular issuer. Our investment objectives are to preserve principal, maintain liquidity and achieve the best available return consistent with our primary objectives of safety and liquidity. As of March 30, 2019, we held no short-term investments. 
As of March 30, 2019, our capital structure was comprised of $31,632 in short-term debt, $443,206 in long-term debt and $485,054 in shareholders' equity. Long-term debt included $80,391 on our Revolving Credit Facility used to finance the acquisition of E2M. The Consolidated Balance Sheets also included $10,418 of unamortized debt issuance costs as of 
March 30, 2019. Total interest-bearing debt as of March 30, 2019 was $474,838. We have a credit agreement with a consortium of financial institutions (the Credit Agreement) that provides for senior secured credit facilities consisting of a Revolving Credit Facility and a Term Facility. The maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility is July 5, 2022 and the maturity date of the loans under the Term Facility is July 5, 2023, unless a term loan lender agrees to extend the maturity date pursuant to a loan modification agreement made in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also requires mandatory prepayments on our Term Facility in certain circumstances, including the potential for an annual required prepayment of a certain percentage of our excess cash flow.
Under the Credit Agreement, we are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, restrictions on our ability to incur debt, create liens, dispose of assets, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into any restrictive agreements and customary events of default (including payment defaults, covenant defaults, change of control defaults and bankruptcy defaults). The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants, including the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to adjusted consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), as defined in the Credit Agreement, as well as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense. These covenants restrict our ability to pay dividends and purchase outstanding shares of common stock. As of March 30, 2019, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our financing arrangements.
Shareholders' equity increased by $7,122 during the six months ended March 30, 2019 primarily due to $24,661 net income and $5,219 stock-based compensation. The increase was partially offset by $10,740 dividends declared and $6,094 other comprehensive loss. Also contributing to the decrease was a cumulative effect of accounting change reduction to our opening retained earnings balance of $6,227 related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
As of March 30, 2019, we believe our current capital resources will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and operations for the foreseeable future, including at least the next twelve months. 
The following critical accounting policy has been updated since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018.
Revenue is recognized either over time as work progresses or at a point-in-time, dependent upon contract-specific terms and the pattern of transfer of control of the product or service to the customer. Contracts with equipment revenue recognized over time use costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying the performance obligation. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Equipment contract costs include materials, component parts, labor and overhead costs. For contracts recognized over time, we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to determine the outcome of future events that may span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, and internal and subcontractor performance.
Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Our Board of Directors approved, and on February 11, 2011 announced, a purchase authorization of 2,000 shares. Authority over pricing and timing under the authorization has been delegated to management. The share purchase authorization has no expiration date. We made no share purchases during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. As of March 30, 2019, there were 438 shares available for purchase under the existing authorization.
In connection with the pricing of the tangible equity units (TEUs) sold in our public offering in fiscal year 2016, we purchased capped calls from third party banking institutions (Capped Calls) for $7,935. On June 13, 2018, we amended the agreements with third party banking institutions for the outstanding Capped Calls (Capped Call Agreements) to modify the timing of settlement to be only upon expiration for all outstanding Capped Calls. Per the Capped Call Agreements, the outstanding Capped Calls will automatically settle upon expiration on July 1, 2019. As of March 30, 2019 the range of shares of our common stock to be received for the outstanding Capped Calls was a minimum of 0 shares to a maximum of 268 shares, subject to market conditions. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our equity instruments.
