Overview
MTS Systems Corporation's testing and simulation hardware, software and service solutions help customers accelerate and improve their design, development and manufacturing processes and are used for determining the mechanical behavior of materials, products and structures. Our high-performance sensors provide measurements of vibration, pressure, position, force and sound in a variety of applications. As of September 29, 2018, we had 3,400 employees and revenue of $778,032 for fiscal year 2018.
Acquisition
On November 21, 2018, we acquired E2M Technologies B.V. (E2M) for a cash purchase price of $80,287. We funded the acquisition of E2M through borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the acquisition of E2M. 
Financing
On November 21, 2018, we amended the Credit Agreement to increase the size of our Revolving Credit Facility from $120,000 to $150,000 and to extend the expiration date to July 5, 2022. The size of the Revolving Credit Facility was increased to finance the purchase of E2M. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the amendment to the Credit Agreement. 
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, certain holders of our TEUs elected to early convert the equity component on 394 of our outstanding TEUs at the minimum conversion rate of 1.9841 which resulted in the issuance of 781 shares of our common stock.

Adoption of New Revenue Recognition Standard
In fiscal year 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), followed by related amendments (collectively, "the new revenue standard" or "ASC 606"). See Note 2 and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the impact of this adoption on our Consolidated Income Statements and Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Terms
The terms "MTS," "we," "us," "the Company" or "our" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, refer to MTS Systems Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Financial Results
Total Company 
The following tables compare results of operations, separately identifying the estimated impact of currency translation, the acquisition of E2M in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and restructuring costs incurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. 
2 The Acquisition column includes revenues and costs from the acquisition of E2M and costs incurred as part of the acquisition of E2M. 
See Notes 3, 16 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the new revenue standard, restructuring and related costs, and the E2M acquisition, respectively. 
Interest expense, net for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased primarily due to an increase in interest expense on the revolving credit facility drawn on in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 to fund the acquisition of E2M, which was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to lower balances on the tranche B term loan, as well as current year favorable effects of our interest rate swap. 
The decrease in other income (expense), net for the three months ended June 29, 2019 was primarily driven by a relative increase in losses on foreign currency transactions, partially offset by an increase in rental income. 
The increase in other income (expense), net for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in rental income, partially offset by a relative increase in losses on foreign currency transactions. 
The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 29, 2019 increased primarily due to higher earnings before tax and the reversal of a $1,297 discrete tax benefit originally recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) as a result of regulatory updates issued during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. 
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased primarily due to certain discrete benefits of $25,378 in the prior year for the estimated impact of the Tax Act. Excluding the impact of these discrete benefits, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 would have been 15.2%. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the implementation of the lower 21% U.S. statutory rate for fiscal year 2019 as compared to the blended statutory rate of 24.5% effective in fiscal year 2018. 
Segment Results
2 The Acquisition column includes revenues and costs from the acquisition of E2M and costs incurred as part of the acquisition of E2M. 
See Notes 3, 16 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the new revenue standard, restructuring and related costs, and the E2M acquisition, respectively. 
Revenue for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 27.8% and 23.3%, respectively, primarily driven by volume growth across all sectors from conversion of robust beginning-of-year backlog and the acquisition of E2M in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation and the E2M acquisition, revenue increased 23.7% and 19.4%, respectively. 
Income from operations for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 146.1% primarily due to increased gross profit on higher revenue volume, partially offset by higher compensation and commissions expense. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the E2M acquisition, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, income from operations increased 125.5%.
The following tables compare results of operations for Sensors, separately identifying the estimated impact of currency translation. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our reportable segments.
Revenue for the three months ended June 29, 2019 increased 6.6% primarily driven by growth in both the Sensors test sector from a multi-year contract with the U.S. Department of Defense and the Sensors industrial sector from strength in the energy market, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, revenue increased 8.9%.
Revenue for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 3.4% primarily driven by growth in the Sensors test sector from a multi-year contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, growth in the Sensors position sector in the first half of the fiscal year and growth in the Sensors industrial sector from strength in the energy market, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, revenue increased 5.6%.
Selling and marketing expense for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively, primarily driven by increased compensation from headcount additions to support sales growth, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, selling and marketing expense increased 3.2% and 3.9%, respectively.
General and administrative expense for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 20.0% and 8.5%, respectively, primarily driven by higher professional fees and compensation expense. Excluding the impact of currency translation, general and administrative expense increased 20.8% and 9.3%, respectively. 
Income from operations for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2019 declined 6.8% and 8.0%, respectively, primarily due to increased compensation expense, the unfavorable impact of currency translation and higher professional fees, partially offset by increased gross profit on higher revenue volume. Excluding the impact of currency translation, income from operations decreased 4.0% and 5.1%, respectively.
Operating Activities
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash used by working capital associated with timing fluctuations from accounts receivable payments received and unbilled accounts receivable accruals, accounts payable payments, advanced payments received from customers, and inventory purchases, as well as a decrease in net income due to the remeasurement of our estimated deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Act in fiscal year 2018. This decrease was partially offset by a reduction in cash used by deferred income taxes due to the Tax Act in fiscal year 2018, an increase in cash provided by other assets and liabilities related to accrued project costs, and a decrease in cash used by payroll-related accruals.
Investing Activities
The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of E2M in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as well as an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment for continued strategic investments in the business. 
Financing Activities
The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility used to fund the acquisition of E2M and a decrease in cash used for long-term debt payments due to required annual Excess Cash Flow payments made in fiscal year 2018. 
We had cash and cash equivalents of $75,735 as of June 29, 2019. Of this amount, $21,623 was located in North America, $28,601 in Europe and $25,511 in Asia. Repatriation of certain foreign earnings is restricted by local law. The North American cash balance was primarily invested in bank deposits. The cash balances in Europe and Asia were primarily invested in money market funds and bank deposits. In accordance with our investment policy, we place cash equivalent investments with issuers who have high-quality investment credit ratings. In addition, we limit the amount of investment exposure we have with any particular issuer. Our investment objectives are to preserve principal, maintain liquidity and achieve the best available return consistent with our primary objectives of safety and liquidity. As of June 29, 2019, we held no short-term investments. 
As of June 29, 2019, our capital structure was comprised of $31,634 in short-term debt, $440,767 in long-term debt and $494,539 in shareholders' equity. Long-term debt included $80,391 on our Revolving Credit Facility used to finance the acquisition of E2M. The Consolidated Balance Sheets also included $9,885 of unamortized debt issuance costs as of June 29, 2019. Total interest-bearing debt as of June 29, 2019 was $472,401. We have a credit agreement with a consortium of financial institutions (the Credit Agreement) that provides for senior secured credit facilities consisting of a Revolving Credit Facility and a Term Facility. The maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility is July 5, 2022 and the maturity date of the loans under the Term Facility is July 5, 2023, unless a term loan lender agrees to extend the maturity date pursuant to a loan modification agreement made in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also requires mandatory prepayments on our Term Facility in certain circumstances, including the potential for an annual required prepayment of a certain percentage of our excess cash flow.
Under the Credit Agreement, we are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, restrictions on our ability to incur debt, create liens, dispose of assets, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into any restrictive agreements and customary events of default (including payment defaults, covenant defaults, change of control defaults and bankruptcy defaults). The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants, including the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to adjusted consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), as defined in the Credit Agreement, as well as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense. These covenants restrict our ability to pay dividends and purchase outstanding shares of common stock. As of June 29, 2019, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our financing arrangements.
Shareholders' equity increased by $16,607 during the nine months ended June 29, 2019 primarily due to $38,246 net income and $7,515 stock-based compensation. The increase was partially offset by $16,355 dividends declared and $6,885 other comprehensive loss. Also contributing to the decrease was a cumulative effect of accounting change reduction to our opening retained earnings balance of $6,227 related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
As of June 29, 2019, we believe our current capital resources will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and operations for the foreseeable future, including at least the next twelve months. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for changes to our capital structure incurred subsequent to the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2019.
