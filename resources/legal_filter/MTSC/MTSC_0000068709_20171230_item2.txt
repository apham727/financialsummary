The following table compares results of operations, separately identifying the estimated impact of currency translation and restructuring costs incurred in fiscal year 2018. 
See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on restructuring and related costs. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we completed the acquisition of PCB Group, Inc. (PCB). As a result of the PCB acquisition, we incurred certain non-recurring costs during fiscal year 2017 including acquisition integration costs and a fair value adjustment on acquired PCB inventory.
Revenue for the three months ended December 30, 2017 declined by 2.6% primarily due to a decrease in Test revenue, partially offset by revenue growth in our Sensors business and the favorable impact of currency translation. Test revenue decreased $12,923 primarily driven by lower equipment order volume in the first half of fiscal year 2017. Current year Test revenue was also impacted by higher custom project backlog weighting which takes longer to convert into revenue. Sensors revenue increased $7,806 primarily driven by strong demand in the Sensors position sector and continued momentum from new revenue opportunities in the Sensors test sector. Excluding the impact of currency translation, revenue decreased 4.6%.
Gross profit for the three months ended December 30, 2017 increased 6.1% primarily due to the prior year impact from the PCB acquisition driven by a fair value adjustment on acquired inventory of $7,724 and increased current year revenue volume in Sensors, partially offset by reduced revenue volume in Test. Gross margin rate increased 3.2 percentage points primarily due to the prior year impact from the PCB acquisition driven by a fair value adjustment on acquired inventory and favorable leverage on increased Sensors revenue volume, partially offset by investments to support the Test project pipeline and unfavorable leverage on lower Test revenue volume. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the prior year fair value adjustment on acquired PCB inventory, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, gross profit declined 5.9% and the gross margin rate declined 0.6 percentage points.
Income from operations for the three months ended December 30, 2017 increased by 60.3% primarily due to the prior year impact from the PCB acquisition driven by a fair value adjustment on acquired PCB inventory of $7,724 and non-recurring PCB acquisition integration expenses of $1,688, prior year China investigation expenses of $1,976, increased gross profit from leverage on volume growth in Sensors, and prior year restructuring costs of $563, partially offset by decreased Test gross profit from unfavorable leverage on revenue. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the prior year fair value adjustment on acquired PCB inventory, prior year non-recurring PCB acquisition integration expenses, prior year China investigation expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, income from operations decreased 25.5%.
The increase in other income (expense), net for the three months ended December 30, 2017 was primarily driven by a decrease in losses on foreign currency transactions. 
Net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 30, 2017 increased due to a reduction in the effective tax rate and discrete benefits stemming from the Tax Act, as well as increased gross profit and lower operating expenses.
Segment Results
The following table compares results of operations for Test, separately identifying the estimated impact of currency translation and restructuring costs incurred in fiscal year 2018.
Revenue for the three months ended December 30, 2017 decreased by 9.9% primarily driven by lower equipment order volume in the first half of fiscal year 2017. Current year Test revenue was also impacted by higher custom project backlog weighting which takes longer to convert into revenue. This was partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation and growth in service revenue. Excluding the impact of currency translation, revenue decreased 11.6%. 
Selling and marketing expense for the three months ended December 30, 2017 increased by 4.1% primarily due to increased compensation expenses and the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, selling and marketing expense increased 1.6%.
General and administrative expense for the three months ended December 30, 2017 declined by 14.3% primarily due to prior year China investigation expenses of $1,976 and increased professional fees, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, prior year China investigation expenses, and restructuring costs, general and administrative expense decreased 1.4%.
Income from operations for the three months ended December 30, 2017 declined by 52.1% primarily due to the decrease in gross profit driven by lower equipment order volume in the first half of fiscal year 2017, partially offset by prior year China investigation expenses of $1,976. Excluding the impact of currency translation, prior year China investigation expenses and restructuring costs, income from operations decreased 55.9%.
The following table compares results of operations for Sensors, separately identifying the estimated impact of currency translation and restructuring costs incurred in fiscal year 2018.
Revenue increased by 11.5% during the three months ended December 30, 2017 primarily driven by strong demand in the Sensors position sector, continued momentum from new revenue opportunities in the Sensors test sector, and the favorable impact of currency translation, partially offset by continued weakness in the Sensors industrial sector. Excluding the impact of currency translation, revenue increased 8.7%.  
Gross profit increased by 45.7% and the gross margin rate increased 12.0 percentage points during the three months ended December 30, 2017 primarily due to the prior year fair value adjustment on acquired PCB inventory of $7,724, prior year non-recurring PCB acquisition integration expenses, leverage on increased revenue volume, the favorable impact of currency translation, and prior year restructuring costs. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the prior year fair value adjustment on acquired PCB inventory of $7,724, prior year non-recurring PCB acquisition integration expenses, and prior year restructuring costs, gross profit increased 9.1% and the gross margin rate increased 0.2 percentage points.
General and administrative expense for the three months ended December 30, 2017 declined by 14.6% primarily driven by prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses of $1,503, prior year restructuring costs and a decrease in incentive compensation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses and prior year restructuring costs, general and administrative expense decreased 0.5%.
Income (loss) from operations increased $12,314 in the three months ended December 30, 2017 primarily due to the prior year fair value adjustment on acquired PCB inventory of $7,724, prior year non-recurring PCB acquisition integration costs of $1,688, higher gross profit from leverage on increased revenue volume, and prior year restructuring costs of $563, partially offset by increased compensation expenses. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the prior year fair value adjustment on acquired PCB inventory, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, income from operations increased 23.1%.
Operating Activities
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in working capital associated with fluctuations in the timing of cash receipts for advanced payments from customers, payments received on accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable, payments for inventory and reduced payments for accounts payable. These were partially offset by an increase in other assets and liabilities primarily driven by an increase in income taxes payable, as well as an increase in net income offset by an decrease in deferred income taxes due to the remeasurement of our estimated deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Act. 
Investing Activities
The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the timing of investments in property and equipment in the current year. 
Financing Activities
The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the annual required excess cash flow payment on the tranche B term loan made in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, partially offset by borrowing on our revolving credit facility. 
We had cash and cash equivalents of $94,071 as of December 30, 2017. Of this amount, $12,947 was located in North America, $30,442 in Europe and $50,682 in Asia. Repatriation of certain foreign earnings is restricted by local law. The North American balance was primarily invested in bank deposits. The balances in Europe and Asia were primarily invested in money market funds and bank deposits. In accordance with our investment policy, we place cash equivalent investments with issuers who have high-quality investment credit ratings. In addition, we limit the amount of investment exposure we have with any particular issuer. Our investment objectives are to preserve principal, maintain liquidity and achieve the best available return consistent with our primary objectives of safety and liquidity. As of December 30, 2017, we held no short-term investments. 
As of December 30, 2017, our capital structure was comprised of $64,098 in short-term debt, $393,381 in long-term debt and $461,580 in shareholders' equity. The Consolidated Balance Sheets also include $15,432 of unamortized debt issuance costs as of December 30, 2017. Total interest-bearing debt at December 30, 2017 was $457,479. On July 5, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with a consortium of financial institutions (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement provides for senior secured credit facilities consisting of a Revolving Credit Facility and a Term Facility. The maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility is July 5, 2021 and the maturity date of the loans under the Term Facility is July 5, 2023, unless a term loan lender agrees to extend the maturity date pursuant to a loan modification agreement made in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
Under the Credit Agreement, we are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, restrictions on our ability to incur debt, create liens, dispose of assets, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, and enter into any restrictive agreements and customary events of default (including payment defaults, covenant defaults, change of control defaults and bankruptcy defaults). The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants, including the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to adjusted consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), as defined in the Credit Agreement, as well as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense. These covenants restrict our ability to pay dividends and purchase outstanding shares of common stock. As of December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.
Shareholders' equity increased by $32,803 during the three months ended December 30, 2017 primarily due to $33,151 net income, $4,006 other comprehensive income and $1,515 stock-based compensation, partially offset by $5,337 dividends declared and $744 purchases and retirements of our common stock.
