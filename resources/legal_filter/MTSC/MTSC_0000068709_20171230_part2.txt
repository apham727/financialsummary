Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
The following table presents repurchases of our equity securities we made during the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2017. 
We purchase common stock from time-to-time to mitigate dilution related to new shares issued as equity for employee compensation such as stock options, restricted stock units, performance restricted stock units and employee stock purchase plan activity, as well as to return to shareholders capital not immediately required to fund ongoing operations. 
Share Purchase Plan
Our Board of Directors approved, and on February 11, 2011 announced, a 2,000 share purchase authorization. Authority over pricing and timing under the authorization has been delegated to management. The share purchase authorization has no expiration date. We made no share purchases during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. As of December 30, 2017, there were 438 shares available for purchase under the existing authorization.
In connection with the pricing of the TEUs sold in our public offering in fiscal year 2016, we purchased capped calls from third party banking institutions (Capped Calls) for $7,935. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we did not settle any of the Capped Calls. As of December 30, 2017 the range of shares of our common stock to be received under the outstanding Capped Calls was 0 to 293 shares, subject to market conditions. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
