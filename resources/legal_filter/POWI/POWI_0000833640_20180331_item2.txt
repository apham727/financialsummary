Our market-penetration strategy also includes capitalizing on the importance of energy efficiency in the power conversion market. For example, our EcoSmart™ technology drastically reduces the amount of energy consumed by electronic products when they are not in use, helping our customers comply with regulations that seek to curb this so-called “standby” energy consumption. Also, our gate-driver products are critical components in energy-efficient DC motor drives, high-voltage DC transmission systems, renewable-energy installations and electric transportation applications.
•Increase the size of our addressable market. Prior to 2010 our addressable market consisted of AC-DC applications with up to about 50 watts of output, a served available market (“SAM”) opportunity of approximately $1.5 billion. Since that time we have expanded our SAM to approximately $3 billion through a variety of means. These include 
the introduction of products that enable us to address higher-power AC-DC applications (such as our Hiper™ product families, which address applications up to about 500 watts) and our entry into the gate-driver markets through the acquisition of CT-Concept Technologie AG in 2012. In 2016 we introduced the SCALE-iDriverTM family of gate-driver ICs, which enables us to address applications between approximately 10 kilowatts and 100 kilowatts, whereas previously our gate-driver products were primarily for applications above 100 kilowatts.
We intend to continue expanding our SAM in the years ahead through all of the means described above.
Our net revenues were $103.1 million and $104.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in net revenues was due primarily to lower unit sales into the communications end-market, reflecting reduced demand for power supplies for cell phone charging and networking applications. The decrease was partially offset by higher unit sales into the industrial and consumer end-markets, driven by growth from a broad range of industrial and consumer-appliance applications.
Our top ten customers, including distributors that resell to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers, accounted for 58% and 59% of our net revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our top customer, a distributor of our products, accounted for approximately 16% and 17% of our net revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. International sales accounted for 96% of our net revenues in each of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
Our gross margin was 52% and 48% in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in gross margin as compared with the same period in the prior year was due primarily to a favorable change in end-market mix, with a greater percentage of revenues coming from higher-margin end-markets.
Total operating expenses were $39.6 million and $37.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was due primarily to the expansion of our work force and annual merit increases, resulting in higher salary and related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017
Net revenues.  Net revenues consist of revenues from product sales, which are calculated net of returns and allowances. Net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $103.1 million and $104.7 million, respectively. The decrease in net revenues, compared with the same period in the prior year, was due primarily to lower unit sales into the communications end-market, reflecting reduced demand for power supplies for cell phone charging and networking applications. The decrease was partially offset by higher unit sales into the industrial and consumer end-markets, driven by growth from a broad range of industrial and consumer-appliance applications.
International sales, consisting of sales outside of the United States of America based on “bill to” customer locations, were $99.2 million and $100.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Although power converters using our products are distributed to end markets worldwide, most are manufactured in Asia. As a result, sales to this region represented 76% and 80%, of our net revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect international sales, and sales to the Asia region in particular, to continue to account for a large portion of our net revenues in the future.
Sales to distributors accounted for 77% of net revenues in each of the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Direct sales to OEMs and power-supply manufacturers accounted for the remainder.
In each of the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, one customer, a distributor of our products, accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues.
 No other customers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in these periods.
The increase in gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with the same period in the prior year, was due primarily to a favorable change in end-market mix, with a greater percentage of revenues coming from higher-margin end-markets.
The increase in other income in the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, was primarily due to an increase in interest income reflecting higher yields earned on our cash and investments.
As of March 31, 2018, we had $257.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, a decrease of approximately $25.2 million from $282.9 million as of December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $301.5 million, a decrease of approximately $12.0 million from $313.5 million as of December 31, 2017.
Operating activities generated cash of $15.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018. Net income for this period was $14.2 million; we also incurred non-cash stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization of $5.6 million, $4.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Sources of cash also included a $0.2 million increase in accounts payable, excluding payables related to property and equipment, due primarily to the timing of payments. These sources of cash were partially offset by a $6.1 million increase in inventory, reflecting anticipated demand, a $3.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily driven by prepaid legal fees and prepaid maintenance agreements, as well as a $0.9 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of cash collections.
Operating activities generated cash of $5.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income for this period was $14.1 million; we also incurred non-cash stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization of $5.0 million, $4.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Sources of cash also included a $1.4 million decrease in inventory due to increased sales during the quarter. These sources of cash were partially offset by an $8.5 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased 
sales in March 2017 compared to December 2016, an $8.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and supplier advances and a $2.4 million decrease in accounts payable, excluding payables related to property and equipment, due primarily to the timing of payments and a $1.1 million increase in deferred income taxes.
Our investing activities provided $45.4 million of cash in the three months ended March 31, 2018, consisting of $52.4 million from sales and maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by $6.5 million for purchases of property and equipment, primarily production-related machinery and equipment. Our investing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2017, resulted in a $22.0 million net use of cash, consisting of $15.6 million for purchases of marketable securities, net of maturities, and $6.4 million for purchases of property and equipment, primarily production-related machinery and equipment.
Our financing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2018, resulted in a $33.4 million net use of cash, consisting of $33.3 million for the repurchase of our common stock and $4.8 million for the payment of dividends to stockholders. These uses of cash were offset in part by $4.7 million from the issuance of common stock, including the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. Our financing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2017 provided $0.3 million of cash. Financing activities consisted of proceeds of $4.4 million from the issuance of common stock, including the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan, offset by $4.1 million for the payment of dividends to stockholders. 
On July 27, 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement with a bank (the "Credit Agreement") that provides us with a $75.0 million revolving line of credit to use for general corporate purposes with a $20.0 million sub-limit for the issuance of standby and trade letters of credit. Our ability to borrow under the revolving line of credit is conditioned upon our compliance with specified covenants, including reporting and financial covenants, primarily a minimum liquidity measure and a debt to earnings ratio, with which we are currently in compliance. The Credit Agreement terminates on July 26, 2019; all advances under the revolving line of credit will become due on such date, or earlier in the event of a default. As of March 31, 2018, we had no amounts outstanding under our agreement.
In January 2017, our board of directors declared four cash dividends in the amount of $0.14 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of each quarter in 2017. We paid a total of $16.6 million in cash dividends in 2017. In January 2018, our board of directors declared four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.16 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of each quarter in 2018. A dividend payout of $4.8 million occurred on March 30, 2018. The declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.
As of March 31, 2018, there were no material changes in our contractual commitments from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
As of March 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
