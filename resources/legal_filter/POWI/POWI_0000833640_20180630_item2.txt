Overview
Our market-penetration strategy also includes capitalizing on the importance of energy efficiency in the power conversion market. For example, our EcoSmart™ technology drastically reduces the amount of energy consumed by electronic products when they are not in use, helping our customers comply with regulations that seek to curb this so-called “standby” energy consumption. Also, our gate-driver products are critical components in energy-efficient DC motor drives, high-voltage DC transmission systems, renewable-energy installations and electric transportation applications.
•Increase the size of our addressable market. Prior to 2010 our addressable market consisted of AC-DC applications with up to about 50 watts of output, a served available market (“SAM”) opportunity of approximately $1.5 billion. Since that time we have expanded our SAM to approximately $3 billion through a variety of means. These include 
the introduction of products that enable us to address higher-power AC-DC applications (such as our Hiper™ product families, which address applications up to about 500 watts) and our entry into the gate-driver markets through the acquisition of CT-Concept Technologie AG in 2012. In 2016 we introduced the SCALE-iDriverTM family of gate-driver ICs, which enables us to address applications between approximately 10 kilowatts and 100 kilowatts, whereas previously our gate-driver products were primarily for applications above 100 kilowatts.
We intend to continue expanding our SAM in the years ahead through all of the means described above.
Our net revenues were $109.5 million and $107.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $212.6 million and $212.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in net revenues for the three month period was due primarily to higher unit sales into the industrial end-market, driven mainly by growth in high-power gate-driver applications. Net revenues for the six-month period were flat compared with the prior-year period as growth in the industrial, computer and consumer end-markets was offset by lower sales into the communications end-market for cellphone-charger and residential-networking applications.
Our top ten customers, including distributors that resell to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers, accounted for approximately 59% and 58% of our net revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and approximately 57% of net revenues in each of the respective corresponding periods of 2017. Our top customer, a distributor of our products, accounted for approximately 14% and 15% of our net revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and approximately 16% and 17% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. International sales accounted for approximately 97% and 96% of our net revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and approximately 96% of net revenues in each of the respective corresponding periods of 2017.
Our gross margin was 51% and 50% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and 52% and 49% in the six months ended June 30, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increases in gross margin as compared with the same periods in the prior year were due primarily to a favorable change in end-market mix, with a greater percentage of revenues coming from higher-margin end-markets; cost-reduction efforts also contributed to the increases.
Total operating expenses were $40.6 million and $39.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $80.2 million and $76.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increases were due primarily to the expansion of our workforce and annual merit increases, resulting in higher salary and related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense; also contributing to the increases were higher product-development expenses in support of our product-development efforts and increased legal expenses related to our litigation with ON Semiconductor.

Results of Operations
The following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated.
Net revenues.  Net revenues consist of revenues from product sales, which are calculated net of returns and allowances. Net revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were $109.5 million and $212.6 million, respectively, and $107.6 million and $212.3 million, respectively, for the corresponding periods of 2017. The increase in net revenues for the three month period was due primarily to higher unit sales into the industrial end-market, driven mainly by growth in high-power gate-driver applications. Net revenues for the six-month period were flat compared with the prior-year period as growth in the industrial, computer and consumer end-markets was offset by lower sales into the communications end-market for cellphone-charger and residential-networking applications.
International sales, consisting of sales outside of the United States of America based on “bill to” customer locations, were $105.8 million and $205.0 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and $103.1 million and $203.9 million in the corresponding periods of 2017, respectively. Although power converters using our products are distributed to end markets worldwide, most are manufactured in Asia. As a result, sales to this region represented 79% and 78%, of our net revenues in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and 78% and 79% of our net revenues in the corresponding periods of 2017, respectively. We expect international sales, and sales to the Asia region in particular, to continue to account for a large portion of our net revenues in the future.
Sales to distributors accounted for 76% of net revenues in each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and 80% and 78% in the corresponding periods of 2017, respectively. Direct sales to OEMs and power-supply manufacturers accounted for the remainder.
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, one customer, a distributor of our products, accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues.
 No other customers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in these periods.
The increases in gross margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, compared with the same periods in the prior year, was due primarily to a favorable change in end-market mix, with a greater percentage of revenues coming from higher-margin end-markets; cost-reduction efforts also contributed to the increases.
The increases in other income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to the same periods in 2017, were due primarily to increases in interest income reflecting higher yields earned on our cash and investments.
As of June 30, 2018, we had $246.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, a decrease of approximately $36.2 million from $282.9 million as of December 31, 2017. As of June 30, 2018, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $288.6 million, a decrease of approximately $24.9 million from $313.5 million as of December 31, 2017.
Operating activities generated cash of $42.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. Net income for this period was $29.6 million; we also incurred non-cash stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization of $11.7 million, $9.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Sources of cash also included a $9.9 million decrease in accounts receivable due to increased cash collections. These sources of cash were partially offset by an $11.7 million increase in inventory, reflecting anticipated demand, a $7.3 million decrease in accounts payable, excluding payables related to property and equipment, due primarily to the timing of payments, and a $1.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily driven by prepaid taxes and maintenance agreements.
Operating activities generated cash of $30.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017. Net income for this period was $28.0 million; we also incurred non-cash stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expenses of $11.3 million, $8.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Sources of cash also included a $3.2 million increase in taxes payable and accrued liabilities. These sources of cash were partially offset by a $12.2 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased shipments, an $8.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and a $3.6 million decrease in accounts payable due primarily to the timing of payments.
Our investing activities provided $79.3 million of cash in the six months ended June 30, 2018, consisting of $90.4 million from sales and maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by $10.5 million for purchases of property and equipment, primarily for manufacturing. Our investing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2017, resulted in a $56.3 million net use of cash, consisting of $33.4 million for purchases of marketable securities, net of maturities, and $22.9 million for purchases of property and equipment, primarily production-related machinery and equipment. 
Our financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2018, resulted in a $67.2 million net use of cash, consisting of $63.4 million for the repurchase of our common stock and $9.5 million for the payment of dividends to stockholders. These uses of cash were offset in part by $5.6 million from the issuance of common stock, including the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. Our financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2017, resulted in a $3.2 million net use of cash. Financing activities consisted of $8.3 million for the payment of dividends to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds of $5.1 million from the issuance of common stock, including the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. 
On July 27, 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement with a bank (the "Credit Agreement") that provides us with a $75.0 million revolving line of credit to use for general corporate purposes with a $20.0 million sub-limit for the issuance of standby and trade letters of credit. The Credit Agreement was amended on April 30, 2018, to extend the termination date from July 26, 2019, to April 30, 2022, with all other terms remaining the same. Our ability to borrow under the revolving line of credit is conditioned upon our compliance with specified covenants, including reporting and financial covenants, primarily a minimum liquidity measure and a debt to earnings ratio, with which we are currently in compliance. The Credit Agreement terminates on April 30, 2022; all advances under the revolving line of credit will become due on such date, or earlier in the event of a default. As of June 30, 2018, we had no amounts outstanding under our agreement.
In January 2017, our board of directors declared four cash dividends in the amount of $0.14 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of each quarter in 2017. We paid a total of $16.6 million in cash dividends in 2017. In January 2018, our board of directors declared four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.16 per share to be paid to stockholders of record at the end of each quarter in 2018. Dividend payouts of approximately $4.8 million and $4.7 million occurred on March 30, 2018 and June 29, 2018, respectively. The declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.
As of June 30, 2018, there were no material changes in our contractual commitments from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
As of June 30, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
