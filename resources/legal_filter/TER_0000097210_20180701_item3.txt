In addition to market risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have an equity price risk related to the fair value of our convertible senior unsecured notes issued in December 2016.
In December 2016, Teradyne issued $460 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior unsecured notes (the Notes) due December 15, 2023.
As of July 1, 2018, the Notes had a fair value of $612.7 million.
The table below provides a sensitivity analysis of hypothetical 10% changes of Teradynes stock price as of the end of the second quarter of 2018 and the estimated impact on the fair value of the Notes.
The fair value of the Notes is subject to equity price risk due to the convertible feature.
The change in stock price affects the fair value of the convertible senior notes, but does not impact Teradynes financial position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation.
Additionally, we carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only.
In connection with the offering of the Notes we also sold warrants to the option counterparties.
These transactions have been accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders equity.
The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the Notes.
