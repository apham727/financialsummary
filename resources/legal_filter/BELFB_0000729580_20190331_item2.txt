Overview 



Our Company 



We design, manufacture and market a broad array of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits.
These products are primarily used in the networking, telecommunications, computing, military, aerospace, transportation and broadcasting industries.
Bel’s portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive, medical and consumer electronics markets.
We operate through three geographic segments: North America, Asia and Europe.
In the three months ended March 31, 2019, 51% of the Company’s revenues were derived from North America, 30% from Asia and 19% from its Europe operating segment.
By product group, 35% of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 related to the Company’s connectivity solutions products, 34% in power solutions and protection products and 31% in magnetic solutions products.
Costs are recorded as incurred for all products manufactured.
Such amounts are determined based upon the estimated stage of production and include labor cost and fringes and related allocations of factory overhead.
Our products are manufactured at various facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Dominican Republic, England, Czech Republic, Slovakia and the PRC.
Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition and be able to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time.
These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, and overtime required in order to meet any increase in demand, can add volatility to the labor costs incurred by us.
We also saw increased demand for our connectivity products for use in commercial aerospace applications, particularly from our after-market customers.
·   Backlog – Our backlog of orders amounted to $166.8 million at March 31, 2019, a decline of $4.4 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2018.
Since year-end, we saw an 11% increase in the backlog for our Connectivity Solutions products, driven by additional orders from our commercial aerospace and distribution customers.
The backlog of orders for our Power Solutions and Protection products declined by 7% and backlog for our Magnetic Solutions products was down 13% from year-end 2018 levels.

  ·   Pricing and Availability of Materials – While material cost and availability for certain components have started to ease, the higher raw material costs which were in place during 2018, particularly related to resistors, capacitors and mosfets, are still running through our statement of operations as we ship the balance of our inventory on hand from 2018.
Lead times continue to be extended for mosfets and costs for those components remain elevated.
As a result, the Company’s material costs as a percentage of sales increased to 41.8% during the first quarter of 2019 from 40.8% during the first quarter of 2018.
·   Labor Costs – Labor costs during the first quarter of 2019 increased from 11.3% of sales during the first quarter of 2018 to 11.5% of sales during the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to minimum wage increases in Mexico which went into effect on January 1, 2019 as well as minimum wage increases in the PRC which went into effect in the first and third quarters of 2018.
·   Restructuring – The Company continues to implement restructuring programs to increase operational efficiencies and incurred $0.9 million in restructuring costs during the first quarter of 2019.
Of these charges, approximately $0.8 million related to our decision to transition manufacturing and warehousing operations from our Inwood, New York facility to other existing Bel facilities.
The balance of the restructuring charges related to the realignment of our R&D resources dedicated to our Power Solutions and Protection group.
We expect these 2019 initiatives to result in annualized cost savings of $2.1 million beginning in the second half of 2019.
The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement.
See “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”     



  ·   Impact of Foreign Currency – During the first quarter of 2019, the Company realized foreign exchange transactional losses of $0.6 million, offset by lower labor and overhead costs of $1.7 million related to favorable fluctuations in exchange rates versus 2018.
The Company was favorably impacted by transactional foreign exchange gains in the first quarter of 2019 due to the depreciation of the Euro, Pound, and Renminbi against the U.S. dollar as compared to exchange rates in effect during 2018.
As a result, the U.S. Dollar equivalent costs of these operations were $1.7 million lower in 2019.
After record bookings throughout 2018, we’ve seen slower bookings during the first quarter of 2019 as customers work through their inventory on hand.
While this is expected to put some downward pressure on sales during the second quarter of 2019, we remain generally optimistic for sales improvement in the second half of year.
We anticipate demand on existing programs to be restored once customers work down their current inventory levels.
Sales growth is also expected within the areas of commercial aerospace and key military platforms related to fighter jet, munition and encryption applications later in the year for our connectivity solutions products, and our power products are well positioned on several new HEV applications.
We have also recently released a variety of products to support the upcoming 5G market, which is expected to provide further upside down the road.
The projections in this paragraph represent Forward-Looking Statements.

Summary by Operating Segment 



Net sales to external customers by operating segment for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Sales growth in our North America segment during the first quarter of 2019 was led by higher sales of our power products into U.S. datacenter applications and increased demand for our connectivity products from our commercial aerospace customers.
Our Europe segment benefited from additional sales of our power products into European datacenter applications during the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the same quarter of 2018.

Net sales and income (loss) from operations by operating segment for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows.
Segment net sales are attributed to individual segments based on the geographic source of the billing for customer sales.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Loss from operations for our North America segment was unfavorably impacted during the first quarter of 2019 by $0.9 million of restructuring costs associated with the transition of manufacturing and warehouse operations from our Inwood, New York facility to other existing Bel facilities, and higher labor costs in Mexico due to an increase in minimum wage rates which went into effect on January 1, 2019.
The increase in income from operations for our Asia segment was in line with the year-over-year sales increase for that segment.
Our Europe segment’s income from operations benefited from higher sales volume and a more favorable exchange rate environment in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the same quarter of 2018.
Net Sales 



The Company’s net sales by major product line for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Connectivity Solutions: 



The increase in sales of our connectivity solutions products during the first quarter of 2019 primarily related to higher demand from our commercial aerospace customers, both for new aircraft builds as well as to service after-market needs.

Return to Index  



Power Solutions and Protection: 



Sales of our power solutions and protection products were $5.7 million, or 15.3%, higher in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter of 2018.
Sales of our Bel Power Solutions products into datacenter applications increased by $6.3 million and sales of our DC/DC power products were $0.5 million higher as compared to last year’s first quarter.
Cost of Sales 



Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Material costs as a percentage of sales increased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 primarily due to the industry-wide supply constraints related to certain of our purchased components during 2018.
The finished goods shipped during the first quarter of 2019 still contained some of the higher-cost raw material components.
Labor costs as a percentage of sales also increased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same period of 2018 as the PRC government increased the minimum wage in the regions where Bel’s factories are located in February and July of 2018.
As such, the majority of the increases in the PRC did not impact the first quarter of 2018 financial results.
Furthermore, the minimum wage rates in Mexico increased effective January 1, 2019 which also drove labor costs higher in the first quarter of 2019.
These factors were partially offset by a more favorable exchange rate environment related to the Chinese Renminbi and Mexican Peso during the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the same quarter of 2018.
Included in cost of sales is research and development (“R&D”) expense of $7.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and $7.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
In total, these other expenses decreased during the first quarter of 2019 by $0.3 million as compared to the same period of 2018, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization expense during the first quarter of 2019.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense (“SG&A”) 



SG&A expense decreased $0.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared with the same period of 2018.
The decrease in SG&A expenses during the 2019 period primarily related to a $0.7 million increase in cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance policies as a result of the stock market rebounding during the first quarter of 2019.
In addition, foreign exchange losses were $0.4 million lower in 2019 versus the 2018 quarter.
These factors were offset by an increase in ERP implementation costs of $0.7 million during the first quarter of 2019 as our first phase went live in January.
The provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was less than $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
The Company’s earnings (loss) before income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2019, were approximately $2.2 million higher than the same period in 2018, primarily attributable to an increase in the income from the Europe and Asia segments, offset by greater losses in the U.S. segment.
The Company’s effective tax rate was 3.3% and (33.2%) for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The change in the effective tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, is primarily attributable to a decrease in taxes related to uncertain tax positions and the impact of permanent differences on U.S. tax exempt activities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 



Our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit, including our credit facility.
At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $37.9 million and $46.3 million, respectively (or 88% and 86%, respectively), of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries of the Company.
During the first quarter of 2019, the Company repatriated $10.0 million of funds from outside of the U.S., with minimal incremental tax liability.
Management has current intentions to repatriate an additional $10 million of funds from outside of the U.S., with a minimal incremental tax liability, by the end of the third quarter of 2019 with the intent of reducing our outstanding debt balance.
Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable comprised approximately 30.3% of the Company’s total assets at March 31, 2019 and 32.9% of total assets at December 31, 2018.
The Company’s current ratio (i.e., the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 3.1 to 1 at March 31, 2019 and 2.7 to 1 at December 31, 2018.
In June 2014, the Company entered into a senior Credit and Security Agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2016, and further amended and refinanced in December 2017.
The Credit and Security Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined (“Leverage Ratio”), and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA to the Company’s consolidated fixed charges (“Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio”).
If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Credit and Security Agreement would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.
At March 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.
The unused credit available under the credit facility at March 31, 2019 was $75.0 million, of which we had the ability to borrow $47.4 million without violating our Leverage Ratio covenant based on the Company’s existing consolidated EBITDA.
We are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global Enterprise Resource Planning system (“ERP”).
The ERP is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, accurately maintain our books and records, and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team.
The implementation of the ERP is being conducted by business units on a three-phase approach through 2020.
We currently estimate total costs over the course of this system implementation to be approximately $6.7 million.
The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement.
See “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Since inception of the project, we have incurred a cumulative amount of $6.1 million in connection with this implementation, of which $1.0 million in implementation costs was incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
These costs are included in SG&A on the consolidated financial statements.
The first phase of the ERP implementation project was completed in the first quarter of 2019 with the Power Solutions business going live on the new system effective January 1, 2019.
In relation to this first phase completed, we anticipate annualized cost savings of approximately $1.3 million beginning in the second quarter of 2019.
The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement.

Cash Flows 



Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 



During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents decreased by $10.7 million.
This decrease was primarily due to the following: 



  ·   net cash used in operating activities of $6.3 million;     



  ·   purchases of property, plant and equipment of $2.4 million;     



  ·   dividend payments of $0.8 million; and     



  ·   repayments of long-term debt of $0.7 million     



During the three months ended March 31, 2019, accounts receivable increased by $2.3 million primarily due to a $2.4 million increase in sales during the month of March 2019 as compared to the month of December 2018.
Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 68 days at March 31, 2019 from 59 days at December 31, 2018.
Inventory increased by $4.2 million at March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, primarily due to the recent slowdown in demand as customers work through their inventory levels on hand.
Inventory turns were 3.3 at March 31, 2019 as compared to 3.7 at December 31, 2018.

Return to Index  



Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 



During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2.5 million.
This decrease was primarily due to the following: 



  ·   purchases of property, plant and equipment of $2.2 million;     



  ·   repayments of long-term debt of $0.8 million; and     



  ·   dividend payments of $0.8 million; partially offset by     



  ·   net cash provided by operations of $0.3 million.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, accounts receivable decreased by $2.5 million primarily due to lower sales volume in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.
Days sales outstanding (DSO) declined to 58 days at March 31, 2018 from 60 days at December 31, 2017.
Inventory increased by $4.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017, primarily due to a change in the timing of revenue recognition (and related release of inventory from our books) in connection with the adoption of ASC 606.
This change in accounting was also the main driver in an increase in inventory turns from 3.6 at December 31, 2017 to 3.8 at March 31, 2018.
