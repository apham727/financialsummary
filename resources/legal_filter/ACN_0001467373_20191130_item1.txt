REVENUES



Disaggregation of Revenue 



See Note 12 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues.
Remaining Performance Obligations 



We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $19 billion and $20 billion as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively.
The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice.
Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations.
Contract Estimates 



Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Contract Balances 



Deferred transition revenues were $583,531 and $563,245 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues.
Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided.
Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment.
Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
Deferred transition costs were $691,727 and $681,492 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs.
Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2019 that were included in Deferred revenues as of August 31, 2019 were $1.8 billion.
Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2018 that were included in Deferred revenues as of September 1, 2018 were $1.8 billion.

7.
LEASES 



We account for leases in accordance with Topic 842.
See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our adoption.
As a lessee, substantially all of our lease obligation is for office real estate.
Our leases may include the option to extend or terminate before the end of the contractual term and are often non-cancelable or cancelable only by the payment of penalties.
Our lease assets and liabilities include these options in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.
In certain cases, we sublease excess office real estate to third-party tenants.
Lease assets and liabilities recognized at the lease commencement date are determined predominantly as the present value of the payments due over the lease term.
Unless the implicit rate can be determined, we use our incremental borrowing rate on that date to calculate the present value.
Our incremental borrowing rate approximates the rate at which we could borrow, on a secured basis for a similar term, an amount equal to our lease payments in a similar economic environment.
Effective September 1, 2019, when we are the lessee, all leases are recognized as lease liabilities and associated lease assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make payments arising from the lease.
Lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and may also include advance payments, initial direct costs or lease incentives.
Fixed and variable payments that depend upon an index or rate, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are included in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities at the commencement-date rate.
As of November 30, 2019, we had no material finance leases.
Operating lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease costs were as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Supplemental information related to operating lease transactions was as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of November 30, 2019, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.4 years and a weighted average discount rate of 4.2%.

The following maturity analysis presents future undiscounted cash outflows for operating leases as of November 30, 2019: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of November 30, 2019, we have entered into operating leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $430 million that are not reflected in the table above.
These leases are primarily related to office real estate and will commence in or before fiscal year 2022 with lease terms of up to 17 years.
MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY 



Dividends 



Our dividend activity during the three months ended November 30, 2019 was as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.
Subsequent Event 



On December 16, 2019, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share on its Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on January 16, 2020 payable on February 14, 2020.
The payment of the cash dividend will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 



Derivatives 



In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.
Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts.
Cash Flow Hedges 



For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized.
For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Derivatives 



Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $56,619 and $48,983 for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments 



The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction.
In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value.
The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements was as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Equity Securities Without Readily Determinable Fair Values 



We hold investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values.
The carrying amount of these investments was $149,525 and $131,675 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively.
10.
In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs.
Our effective tax rates for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 were 23.6% and 19.8%, respectively.

11.
For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.
To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above.
On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.
Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood.
We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, at this time.
