Overview



CDW Corporation, a Fortune 500 company and member of the S&P 500 Index, is a leading provider of integrated information technology ("IT") solutions with multi-national capabilities to small, medium and large business, and government, education and healthcare customers in the US, the UK and Canada.
Our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration.
We are technology "agnostic," with a broad portfolio including more than 100,000 products and services from more than 1,000 leading and emerging brands.
Our solutions are delivered in physical, virtual and cloud-based environments through over 6,000 customer-facing coworkers, including sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers.
We are a leading sales channel partner for many original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), software publishers and cloud providers (collectively, our "vendor partners"), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer.
We provide our vendor partners with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage, technical expertise and extensive customer access.
Our Corporate segment primarily serves US private sector business customers with more than 250 employees.
Our Small Business segment primarily serves US private sector business customers with up to 250 employees.
Our Public segment is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the US.
We also have two other operating segments: CDW UK and CDW Canada, each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category ("Other").
We may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer.
Each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements.
We also resell software for major software publishers.
Our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services.
In addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals.
A significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses are reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners.
This is particularly the case for our Corporate and Small Business customers, as their purchases tend to reflect confidence in their business prospects, which are driven by their discrete perceptions of business and general economic conditions.
There continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of the UK's planned withdrawal from the European Union ("EU") (referred to as "Brexit").
We have established a presence on the continent to support CDW UK's broader growth opportunities in the EU.
This also serves as a contingency plan to address future developments as needed around Brexit.

•Changes in spending policies, budget priorities and funding levels are a key factor influencing the purchasing levels of government, healthcare and education customers.
•Technology trends drive customer purchasing behaviors in the market.
These trends are driving customer adoption of solutions such as those delivered via cloud, software defined architectures and hybrid on-premise and off-premise combinations, as well as the evolution of the IT consumption model to more "as a service" offerings, including Device as a Service ("DaaS") and managed services.
Effective January 1, 2019, we made a change to the Non-GAAP financial measures that we use to provide meaningful methods of evaluating our financial performance and have replaced EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin with Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP operating income margin.
We made this change due to the continuing evolution of the IT consumption model.
Non-GAAP operating income is also being used for the first time in 2019 as a key business metric for our annual incentive compensation programs.
In addition to Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP operating income margin, we believe that the most important financial and non-financial measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per diluted share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, free cash flow, return on working capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable and certain receivables due from vendors plus days of supply in Merchandise inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable and Accounts payable-inventory financing, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit, sales per coworker and coworker turnover.
These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.
Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business.
For the definitions of Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes and Non-GAAP net income and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see "Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations."

Interest expense, net



At September 30, 2019, our outstanding debt totaled $3,304 million compared to $3,238 million at September 30, 2018.
Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was $42 million, an increase of $5 million compared to $37 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018.

Income tax expense was $59 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to $55 million for the same period of the prior year.
The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily attributable to higher excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations



We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income and Net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 below.
Non-GAAP operating income margin is defined as Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of Net sales.
Net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on Net sales compared to the prior period.
Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business.
Non-GAAP operating income



Non-GAAP operating income was $380 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, an increase of $46 million, or 13.9%, compared to $334 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018.

For additional details, see Note 4 (Inventory Financing Agreements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Share Repurchase Program



During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we repurchased 4.8 million shares of our common stock for $493 million under the previously announced share repurchase program.
For additional details on our share repurchase program, see Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
The dividend will be paid on December 10, 2019 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 25, 2019.
(3)The change is due to favorable timing of collections.
(4)The change is due to higher customer-driven stocking positions.
(5)The change is due to timing of payments, partially offset by increased sales in 2019.
(6)The change is due to a higher increase in the receivables from vendors due to the growth in business and a lower increase in accrued compensation expense.
Components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



48

(1)Represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of Accounts receivable, net at the end of the period, divided by average daily Net sales for the same three-month period.
Also incorporates components of other miscellaneous receivables.
(2)Represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of Merchandise inventory at the end of the period divided by average daily Cost of sales for the same three-month period.
(3)Represents the rolling three-month average of the combined balance of Accounts payable-trade, excluding cash overdrafts, and Accounts payable-inventory financing at the end of the period divided by average daily Cost of sales for the same three-month period.
The cash conversion cycle decreased to 17 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 18 days at September 30, 2018.
DSO, DIO and DPO increased 1 day, 1 day and 3 days, respectively, compared to September 30, 2018.
The increase in DSO was primarily driven by higher Net sales and third-party services such as Software as a Service and warranties.
These sales have an unfavorable impact on DSO as the receivable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the Consolidated Statement of Operations is recorded on a net basis.
This was partially offset by favorable timing of collections.
Additionally, DIO increased due to higher customer-driven stocking positions.
Investing Activities



Net cash used in investing activities increased $97 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to September 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to the completion of our acquisition of Scalar on February 1, 2019 for $75 million.
Additionally, Capital expenditures increased $22 million primarily due to investments for improvements to our information technology systems.
Financing Activities



Net cash used in financing activities increased $133 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to September 30, 2018.
The increase was primarily driven by our share repurchases and increasing dividends per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, which were partially offset by refinancing of our 2023 Senior Notes through the issuance of 2028 Senior Notes, further leveraging of our inventory financing arrangements and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities.
Contractual Obligations



Except as disclosed above under "Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements," there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
