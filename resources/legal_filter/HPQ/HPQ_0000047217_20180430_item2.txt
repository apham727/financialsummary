•Liquidity and Capital Resources. An analysis of changes in our cash flows and a discussion of our liquidity and financial condition.
•Contractual and Other Obligations. An overview of contractual obligations, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan contributions, cost-saving plans, uncertain tax positions and off-balance sheet arrangements of our operations.
•In Personal Systems, our strategic focus is on profitable growth through hyper market segmentation with respect to enhanced innovation in multi-operating systems, multi-architecture, geography, customer segments and other key attributes. Additionally, we are investing in premium and mobility form factors such as convertible notebooks, detachable notebooks, and mobility devices in order to meet customer preference for mobile, thinner and lighter devices. The beginning of a market shift to contractual solutions includes an increased focus on Device as a Service. We believe that we are well positioned due to our competitive product lineup.
•In Printing, our strategic focus is on business printing, a shift to contractual solutions and Graphics, as well as expanding our footprint in the 3D printing marketplace. Business printing includes delivering solutions to SMBs and enterprise customers, such as multi-function and PageWide printers, including our JetIntelligence lineup of LaserJet printers. The shift to contractual solutions includes an increased focus on Managed Print Services and Instant Ink, which presents strong after-market supplies opportunities. In the Graphics space, we are focused on innovations such as our Indigo and Latex product offerings. We plan to continue to focus on shifting the mix in the installed base to higher value units and expanding our innovative Ink, Laser, Graphics and 3D printing programs. We continue to execute on our key initiatives of focusing on high-value products targeted at high usage categories and introducing new revenue delivery models. Our focus is on placing higher value printer units which offer strong annuity of toner and ink, the design and deployment of A3 products and solutions, accelerating growth in Graphic solutions and 3D printing.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
A second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our primary competitors are exerting competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others. A third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution.
To address these challenges, we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners. In addition, we need to continue to improve our operations, with a particular focus on enhancing our end-to-end processes and efficiencies. We also need to continue to optimize our sales coverage models, align our sales incentives with our strategic goals, improve channel execution, strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, and develop and capitalize on market opportunities. 
We typically experience higher net revenues in our first and fourth quarters compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Historical seasonal patterns should not be considered reliable indicators of our future net revenues or financial performance.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Net Revenue
For the three months ended April 30, 2018, total net revenue increased 13.1% (increased 9.9% on a constant currency basis) as compared to the prior-year period. U.S. net revenue increased 5.0% to $4.7 billion, while net revenue from international operations increased 17.6% to $9.3 billion. For the six months ended April 30, 2018, total net revenue increased 13.8% (increased 11.4% on a constant currency basis) as compared to the prior-year period. U.S. net revenue increased 7.2% to $9.7 billion, while net revenue from international operations increased 17.5% to $18.8 billion. The increase in net revenue was primarily driven by growth in Notebooks, Desktops, Commercial Printing Hardware and Supplies revenue and favorable foreign currency impacts.
A detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment net revenue is included in “Segment Information” below.
Gross Margin
For the three months ended April 30, 2018, our gross margin increased 0.1 percentage points as compared to the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by an improved rate in Personal Systems due to higher average selling prices (“ASPs”), partially offset by higher commodity costs in Personal Systems and higher Commercial Hardware unit placements in Printing. For the six months ended April 30, 2018, our gross margin remained flat, as compared to the prior-year period.
A detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment gross margins is included under “Segment Information” below.
Operating Expenses
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expense increased 15.6% and 15.3% for the three and six months ended April 30, 2018, respectively, as compared to the prior-year periods, primarily driven by the acquisition of Samsung’s printer business and incremental go-to-market investments to support revenue growth.
Restructuring and Other Charges
Restructuring and other charges for the three and six months ended April 30, 2018 relate primarily to the Fiscal 2017 Plan and certain non-recurring costs, including those as a result of the Separation.
Acquisition-related charges
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Acquisition-related charges for the three and six months ended April 30, 2018 relate primarily to third-party professional and legal fees, and integration-related costs, as well as fair value adjustments of certain acquired assets such as inventory.
Amortization of intangible assets for the three and six months ended April 30, 2018 relate to intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Samsung’s printer business.
Interest and Other, Net
Interest and other, net expense increased by $817 million and $804 million for the three and six months ended April 30, 2018, respectively, as compared to the prior-year periods, primarily due to reversal of indemnification receivables from Hewlett Packard Enterprise pertaining to various audit settlements, and loss on extinguishment of debt. 
Benefit from (Provision for) Taxes
During the three and six months ended April 30, 2018, we recorded $1.1 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of net tax benefits related to discrete items in the provision for taxes. As discussed in the Note 6 we have not yet completed our analysis of the full impact of TCJA. However, for the three months ended January 31, 2018, we recorded a provisional tax benefit of $1.1 billion related to $5.5 billion net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings, partially offset by $3.2 billion net expense for the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments over eight years and $1.2 billion net expense for remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities for the revaluation of our deferred assets and liabilities to the new U.S. statutory tax rate. In addition, for the three months ended April 30, 2018, we recorded provisional tax expense of $379 million related to remeasurement of our U.S. deferred taxes that are expected to be realized at a lower rate and a $43 million tax benefit as an adjustment to the provisional deemed repatriation tax amount due to further analysis and additional guidance. This amount also included tax benefits related to audit settlements of $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion for the three and six months ended April 30, 2018, respectively, and loss on extinguishment of debt of $33 million for the three and six months ended April 30, 2018. These tax benefits were offset by uncertain tax position charges of $8 million and $51 million for the three and six months ended April 30, 2018, respectively. During the three and six months ended April 30, 2018, in addition to the discrete items mentioned above, we recorded excess tax benefits of $6 million and $34 million, respectively, on stock options, restricted stock units and performance-adjusted restricted stock units.
During the three and six months ended April 30, 2017, we recorded $4 million and $5 million , respectively, of net tax benefits related to discrete items in the provision for taxes for continuing operations. These amounts included a tax benefit of $12 million and $31 million for the three and six months ended April 30, 2017, respectively, related to restructuring charges. The three months ended April 30, 2017 also included various other tax charges of $8 million. The six months ended April 30, 2017 also included a tax charge of $26 million related to state provision to return adjustments.
A description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 2, “Segment Information” to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. Future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the segments disclosed.
 Effective at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2018, HP implemented an organizational change to align its segment and business unit financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. The organizational change resulted in the transfer of long-life consumables from Commercial to Supplies within the Printing segment. Certain revenues related to service arrangements, which are being eliminated for the purposes of reporting HP’s consolidated net revenue, have 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
now been reclassified from Other to segments. HP has reflected this change to its segment and business unit information in prior reporting periods on an as-if basis. The reporting change had no impact on previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share.
Personal Systems
Three months ended April 30, 2018 compared with three months ended April 30, 2017
Personal Systems net revenue increased 14.5% (increased 10.7% on a constant currency basis) for the three months ended April 30, 2018 as compared to the prior-year period. The net revenue increase was primarily due to growth in Notebooks and Desktops and favorable foreign currency impacts. The net revenue increase was driven by a 7.0% increase in both unit volume and ASPs as compared to the prior-year period. The increase in unit volume was primarily due to growth in Notebooks and Desktops. The increase in ASPs was due to foreign currency impacts, positive mix shifts and favorable pricing rate.
Consumer revenue increased 10.5% for the three months ended April 30, 2018 as compared to the prior-year period, driven by growth in Notebooks and Desktops as a result of higher unit volume combined with higher ASPs.

margin as a percentage of net revenue was flat due to higher ASPs, offset by an increase in commodity costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased primarily due to operating expense management.
Three months ended April 30, 2018 compared with three months ended April 30, 2017
Printing net revenue increased 10.9% (increased 8.7% on a constant currency basis) for the three months ended April 30, 2018 as compared to the prior-year period. The increase in net revenue was driven by increases in both Supplies and Hardware revenue, and favorable foreign currency impacts. Net revenue for Supplies increased 7.7% as compared to the prior-year period, including the acquisition of Samsung’s printer business. Printer unit volume increased 13.3% while ASPs increased 1.6% as compared to the prior-year period. The increase in printer unit volume was primarily driven by unit increases in Commercial Hardware, including the Samsung-branded printers. Printer ASPs increased primarily due to favorable foreign currency impacts, partially offset by the dilution impact from Samsung-branded low-end A4 products.
Net revenue for Commercial Hardware increased by 26.7% as compared to the prior-year period, including revenue from Samsung-branded printers, LaserJet and PageWide printers. The unit volume in Commercial Hardware increased primarily due to Samsung-branded printers. The ASP decrease in Commercial Hardware was primarily due to dilution impact from Samsung-branded low-end A4 products.

Corporate Investments
The loss from operations in Corporate Investments for the three months and six months ended April 30, 2018 was primarily due to expenses associated with our incubation projects.
We use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that internally generated cash flows are generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, maturing debt, income tax payments and the payment of stockholder dividends, in addition to investments and share repurchases. We are able to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, with broad access to capital markets and credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. While our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions, our access to a variety of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 and the market risks identified in the section entitled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Item 3 of Part I of this report, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with the majority of those amounts held outside of the United States. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. Our cash position remains strong, and we expect that our cash balances, anticipated cash flow generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected near-term cash outlays.

Working Capital Metrics
April 30, 2018 as compared to April 30, 2017
DSO measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average net revenue. The increase in DSO was primarily due to unfavorable revenue linearity.
Investing Activities
Compared to the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017, net cash used in investing activities increased by $0.9 billion for the six months ended April 30, 2018, primarily due to payment for the acquisition of Samsung’s printer business.
Financing Activities
Debt Levels
We maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital and targeted capital structure.

of October 31, 2017, bearing weighted-average interest rates of 4.2% and 4.0% for April 30, 2018 and October 31, 2017, respectively, primarily due to the payment for the repurchase of approximately $1.85 billion in aggregate principal amount of U.S. Dollar Global Notes.
Our weighted-average interest rate reflects the average effective rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the impact of interest rate swaps. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 9, “Financial Instruments”, to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
As of April 30, 2018, we maintain a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of $4.0 billion, which will be available until March 30, 2023 and is primarily to support the issuance of commercial paper. Funds borrowed under this revolving credit facility may also be used for general corporate purposes. As of April 30, 2018, we had $1.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding.
We increased our issuance authorization under our commercial paper program from $4.0 billion to $6.0 billion in November 2017. In December 2017, we also entered into an additional revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that provides us with $1.5 billion of available borrowings until November 30, 2018.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
On October 10, 2016, HP’s Board of Directors authorized $3.0 billion for future repurchases of its outstanding shares of common stock. This program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions. HP intends to use repurchases from time to time to offset the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically. All share repurchases settled in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 were open market transactions. As of April 30, 2018, HP had approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the share repurchase authorizations.
