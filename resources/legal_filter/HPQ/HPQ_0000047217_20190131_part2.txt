Item 1A. Risk Factors.
We have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial, personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors, and our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to their products and services compared to the resources allocated to our competing products and services.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
On June 19, 2018, HP’s Board of Directors authorized $4.0 billion for future repurchases of its outstanding shares of common stock. This program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions. HP intends to use repurchases from time to time to offset the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically. All share repurchases settled in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were open market transactions. As of January 31, 2019, HP had approximately $3.2 billion remaining under the share repurchase authorizations.
Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.
None.

Disclosure Under Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires issuers to disclose certain types of dealings by the issuer or its affiliates relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities that are subject to sanctions under U.S. law. 
HP acquired the Apogee group, a U.K. based office equipment dealer, on November 1, 2018. During the first quarter of 2019, HP discovered that its newly acquired subsidiary processed two service calls during November 2018, shortly after the acquisition, for toner replacement on behalf of Bank Saderat plc, with which it had a legacy contract. Bank Saderat plc is subject to U.S. sanctions pursuant to Executive Order 13224. The combined total value of the transactions was £85.52 ($112.92). We are unable to accurately calculate the net profit attributable to these transactions. Following HP’s discovery of these transactions and at HP’s direction, Apogee terminated the contract with Bank Saderat plc. HP has disclosed these transactions to the relevant authorities.
