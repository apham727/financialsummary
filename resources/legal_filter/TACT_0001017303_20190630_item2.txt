Business Highlights 



In March 2019, TransAct announced the launch of its BOHA!
SaaS-based software and hardware ecosystem, and in May 2019, at the National Restaurant Association show in Chicago, TransAct announced the debut of BOHA!
Timer, its latest addition to the BOHA!™ ecosystem.
BOHA!
is a comprehensive ecosystem of cloud-based SaaS apps and hardware designed to help restaurant and food service companies automate their back-of-house operations.
BOHA!
represents the first single-vendor solution to allow customers to choose from any combination of applications for Inventory Management, Temperature Monitoring of Food and Equipment, Food Safety Labeling, Food Recalls, Checklists & Procedures, Equipment Service Management, Timers and Delivery Management.
In April 2019, TransAct announced that it has secured commitments from 10 distinct restaurant or foodservice operators representing a broad mix of customers to deploy BOHA!
solutions in their operations, and that it expects to roll out approximately 240 BOHA!
Terminals over the balance of 2019 relating to these commitments.
In June 2019, TransAct announced an agreement with a large, international foodservice brand that includes the deployment of BOHA!
hardware and software across an initial 1,000 locations that will roll out by the end of 2019, and based on additional expansions of this customer’s stores and a successful roll out of BOHA!, the potential for additional deployments of BOHA!
hardware and software could include 2,000 to 3,000 more locations over the next two to three years.
In June 2019, TransAct also announced that the Company’s Epic Edge and Epic 950 ticket-in/ticket-out printers are installed in all of the more than 3,150 gaming machines at the new Encore Boston Harbor in Everett, Massachusetts, with more than 60% of the installed Epic printers represented by TransAct’s next-generation Epic Edge.
In July 2019, TransAct announced that it has secured a new agreement with a large U.S. foodservice provider for the deployment of the BOHA!
terminals and one of the BOHA!
SaaS-based apps at more than 400 locations by 2021 year end.
TransAct expects approximately 175 customer locations will be live with the BOHA!
hardware and software solutions by 2019 year end with an additional approximately 250 locations expected to go live over the following two years.
13 



In July 2019, TransAct also announced its first ever agreement to deploy the Company’s BOHA!
solution in the Asia-Pacific market as well as with an operator in the casino gaming industry.
The new agreement, with a leading Macau casino resort, will include 100 BOHA!
terminals and one of the BOHA!
SaaS based apps and is expected to occur by the end of 2019.
We have reviewed those policies and determined that they remain our critical accounting policies for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales, as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 *  International sales do not include sales of printers and terminals made to domestic distributors or other domestic customers who may, in turn, ship those printers and terminals to international destinations.
Net sales for the second quarter of 2019 decreased $3.4 million, or 23%, from the same period in 2018.
The average selling price of our printers, terminals and other hardware remained consistent during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018. 



International sales for the second quarter of 2019 decreased $0.8 million, or 23%, from the same period in 2018 due primarily to a 27% decrease in sales in the international casino and gaming market.
Restaurant Solutions.
These terminals help food service establishments and restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick-serve convenience and hospitality establishments) effectively manage food safety and automate and manage back-of-the-house operations.
In addition to sales of terminals, revenue includes sales of cloud-based software applications and other hardware (including handheld devices, tablets, temperature probes and temperature sensors).
In 2019, we launched our BOHA!
solution, which combines our latest generation terminal, cloud-based software application and hardware into a unique solution to automate the back-of-house operations in restaurants.
Sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



14 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 was driven primarily by BOHA!
terminal sales to two large corporate customers in the second quarter of 2018 that did not reoccur in the second quarter of 2019.
During the second quarter of 2019, we experienced continued growth in our sales of BOHA!
software, launched during the first quarter of 2019.
Sales of BOHA!
software recognized on a SaaS subscription basis increased by 24% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2019.
POS automation and banking.
Revenue from the POS automation and banking market includes sales of thermal printers used primarily by quick serve restaurants located either at the checkout counter or within self-service kiosks to print receipts for consumers or print on linerless labels.
In addition, revenue includes sales of inkjet printers used by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to print deposit or withdrawal receipts and/or validate checks at bank teller stations.
Sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in both domestic and international POS automation and banking product revenue for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by a 26% decrease in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, largely to McDonald’s.
We expect sales of our Ithaca® 9000 to McDonald’s to be lower in 2019 compared to 2018.
Casino and gaming.
Revenue from the casino and gaming market includes sales of thermal ticket printers used in slot machines, video lottery terminals, and other gaming machines that print tickets or receipts instead of issuing coins at casinos and racetracks and other gaming venues worldwide.
Revenue from this market also includes sales of thermal roll-fed printers used in the international off-premise gaming market in gaming machines such as Amusement with Prizes, Skills with Prizes and Fixed Odds Betting Terminals at non-casino gaming establishments.
In addition, casino and gaming market revenue includes sales of the EPICENTRAL™ print system, our software solution (including annual software maintenance), that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them real-time at the slot machine.
During 2018 we had a large sale to an OEM which did not reoccur in 2019.
This decrease was partially offset by a slight increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
Additionally, we had slightly higher revenue from recurring EPICENTRALTM annual software maintenance fees during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
We did not complete any new installations of our EPICENTRAL™ software systems in the second quarter of 2019 or 2018.
15 



Lottery.
Revenue from the lottery market includes sales of thermal on-line and other lottery printers primarily to International Game Technology and its subsidiaries (“IGT”) and, to a lesser extent, other lottery system companies for various lottery applications.
Printrex.
Printrex branded printers are sold into markets that include wide format, desktop and rack mounted and vehicle mounted black/white thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field, seismic and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry.
It also includes high-speed color inkjet desktop printers used to print logs at the data centers of the oil and gas field service companies.
Prior to 2019, revenue in this market also included sales of vehicle mounted printers used to print schematics and certain other critical information in emergency services vehicles and other mobile printing applications.
TSG.
Revenue generated by our TSG includes sales of consumable products (inkjet cartridges, ribbons, receipt paper, color thermal paper, food safety labels and other printing supplies), replacement parts, maintenance and repair services, technical support services, testing services, refurbished printers, and shipping and handling charges.
Sales in our worldwide TSG market for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the prior year period was due primarily to 49% lower sales of replacement parts including lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
This decrease was partially offset by increases in our service revenue of 49% and label sales related to our restaurant solutions products of 131%.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 primarily due to a 50% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers.

Gross Profit.
software solutions.
For the second quarter of 2019, gross profit decreased $1.3 million, or 18%, due to a 23% decline in sales during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
This decrease in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in our gross margin of 290 basis points in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
We expect engineering, design and product development expenses in 2019 to be consistent with 2018.
Operating Expenses - Selling and Marketing.
Such expenses remained consistent increasing less than 1% during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
software and hardware solutions.
Operating Expenses - General and Administrative.
General and administrative expense information for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



General and administrative expenses primarily include salaries, incentive compensation, and other payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resources and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company.
General and administrative expenses increased $80 thousand, or 4%, for the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 due primarily to higher professional and legal expenses.
These increases were partially offset by lower recruiting expense incurred during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018.
We expect general and administrative expense to be higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due to additional investment to support restaurant solutions.
17 



Operating Income.
Operating income information for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Our operating income decreased $1.3 million, or 81%, in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018, and our operating margin decreased to 2.7% of net sales due to a decrease in sales of 23%, partially offset by a 290 basis point increase in gross margin during the second quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year period.
Interest.
We recorded net interest expense of $7 thousand in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $6 thousand in the second quarter of 2018.
We do not expect significant changes in net interest expense for the full year 2019.
Other, net.
We recorded other expense of $142 thousand in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $97 thousand in the second quarter of 2018 due to higher foreign exchange losses recorded by our U.K. entity in the second quarter of 2019.
Going forward, we may continue to experience more foreign exchange gains or losses depending on the level of sales to Europe through our U.K. subsidiary and the change in exchange rates of the Euro and Pound Sterling against the U.S. dollar.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 was lower as it included the foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) deduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as well as near breakeven pre-tax income in the second quarter of 2019.
Net Income.
We reported net income for the second quarter of 2019 of $186 thousand, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to $1.2 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2018.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018 was primarily driven by a 24% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s decreased during the first half of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. 



International POS automation and banking sales decreased due to lower sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer to our Canadian distributor for McDonald’s during the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018.
Casino and gaming.
The decrease in international sales in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 was due primarily to a 30% decline in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to Europe, Australia and Asia.
Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
19 



Lottery.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 



Cash Flow 



For the first six months of 2019, our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $0.4 million, or 8%, from December 31, 2018.
We ended the second quarter of 2019 with $4.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $0.4 million was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding.
Operating activities: The following significant factors affected our cash provided by operating activities of $1.6 million for the first six months of 2019 as compared to $2.5 million for the first six months of 2018: 



During the first six months of 2019: 



  ●  We reported net income of $0.9 million.
●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $0.5 million, and share-based compensation expense of $0.4 million.
●  Accounts receivable decreased $1.7 million, or 21%, due to the collection of receivables for 2018 sales and lower sales volume in the second quarter of 2019.
●  Inventories increased $1.4 million, or 11%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales of BOHA!
hardware products for the restaurant solutions market.
●  Other current and long term assets increased $0.3 million, or 46% due primarily to an advanced payment of royalty fees to a technology partner for restaurant solutions.
●  Accounts payable increased $0.3 million, or 8%, due to the timing of inventory purchases made during the second quarter of 2019.
●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $0.6 million, or 15%, due primarily to the payment of 2018 annual bonuses in March 2019.
During the first six months of 2018: 



  ●  We reported net income of $1.9 million.
●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $0.5 million, and share-based compensation expense of $0.3 million.
●  Accounts receivable decreased $0.7 million, or 6%, due largely to the collection of past due receivables for 2017 sales made to our former international casino and gaming distributor.
●  Inventories increased $2.5 million, or 28%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales in the casino and gaming and restaurant solutions markets.

Investing activities: Our capital expenditures, including capitalized software costs, were $0.4 million and $0.8 million for the first six months of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Expenditures for the first six months of 2019 were primarily for new product tooling equipment and, to a lesser extent, computer and networking equipment.
Expenditures for the first six months of 2018 were primarily for computer and networking equipment and furniture and fixtures purchases related to investments made in our U.K. facility to support the build-out of our internal sales infrastructure to sell directly to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers.
To a lesser extent, expenditures in the first six months of 2018 included computer and networking equipment for our U.S. operations and leasehold improvements made at our Las Vegas facility.
products, new product tooling, new computer software and equipment purchases.
Financing activities: We used $1.6 million of cash from financing activities during the first six months of 2019 to pay dividends of $1.3 million and $0.2 million related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan.
During the first six months of 2018, we used $3.5 million of cash from financing activities to purchase $2.0 million of common stock for treasury, to pay dividends of $1.3 million to common shareholders and $0.3 million related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $0.1 million.
Credit Facility and Borrowings 



We maintain a credit facility (the "TD Bank Credit Facility") with TD Bank N.A.
(“TD Bank”), which provides for a $20 million revolving credit line.
On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022.
Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all of our assets.
We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line.
The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12.5 million from $10 million.
The TD Bank Credit Facility imposes certain quarterly financial covenants on us and restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the creation of other liens.
We were in compliance with all financial covenants of the TD Bank Credit Facility at June 30, 2019.
The following table lists the financial covenants and the performance measurements at June 30, 2019: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of June 30, 2019, borrowings available under the TD Bank Credit facility were $20 million.
Shareholder Dividend Payments 



In 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the Board’s approval each quarter.
Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017.
Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $0.7 million or $0.09 per share in the second quarter of both 2019 and 2018.
On July 31, 2019, our Board of Directors approved the third quarter 2019 dividend in the amount of $0.09 per share payable on or about September 16, 2019 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on August 20, 2019.
Dividends declared and paid totaled $1.3 million, or $0.18 per share, for both the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
Stock Repurchase Program 



On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”).
The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue the repurchase program prior to such time.
We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account.
Resource Sufficiency 



We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our expected cash flows generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our TD Bank Credit Facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, and dividend payments, and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months.
Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 



The disclosure of payments we have committed to make under our contractual obligations is set forth under Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2018.
