Item 1.
Legal Proceedings 



We are subject to various legal proceedings, both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business.
We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings or in certain instances provide reasonable ranges of potential losses.
However, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we believe that none of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
