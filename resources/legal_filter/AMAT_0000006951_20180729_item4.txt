Disclosure Controls and Procedures



As of the end of the period covered by this report, management of Applied conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of Applied’s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act).
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Applied implemented a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for certain of its business units, subsidiaries and locations.
The ERP system replaces a legacy manufacturing system, automates and streamlines the consolidation process and enhances reporting capabilities.
Throughout the implementation, Applied evaluated the impact of the ERP system on its internal control over financial reporting and made changes to controls where necessary to maintain the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in all material respects.
It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met.
