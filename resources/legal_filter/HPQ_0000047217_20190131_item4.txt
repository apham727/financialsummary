Other Information.
The foregoing description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the amendment to the credit facility, which is filed as Exhibit 10(k)(k) hereto.
HP acquired the Apogee group, a U.K. based office equipment dealer, on November 1, 2018.
During the first quarter of 2019, HP discovered that its newly acquired subsidiary processed two service calls during November 2018, shortly after the acquisition, for toner replacement on behalf of Bank Saderat plc, with which it had a legacy contract.
Bank Saderat plc is subject to U.S. sanctions pursuant to Executive Order 13224.
The combined total value of the transactions was £85.52 ($112.92).
Following HP’s discovery of these transactions and at HP’s direction, Apogee terminated the contract with Bank Saderat plc.
HP has disclosed these transactions to the relevant authorities.
