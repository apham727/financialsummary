Our critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgments underlying them, are discussed in our 2018 Form 10-K in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842), which amends existing guidance and requires an entity to recognize both assets and liabilities arising from financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the accounting standard effective January 1, 2019. Please see Note 3 for the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this standard. There were no other significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. 
Recently issued accounting standards and their estimated effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are also described in Note 17, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
Repurchases of the Company’s common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In August 2019, the Company announced the adoption of a $2.0 million stock repurchase program running through the end of 2020. Under the stock repurchase program, repurchases can be made from time to time using a variety of methods, including through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable legal requirements. This new $2.0 million repurchase program replaces a stock repurchase program that the Company had adopted in 2008. The 2008 stock repurchase program had authorized the repurchase of up to 411,910 additional shares, but had no specific dollar amount associated with it. The Company had not made any market repurchases under the 2008 stock repurchase program in the past several years.
