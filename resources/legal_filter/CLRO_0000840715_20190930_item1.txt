Basis of Presentation: 



The fiscal year for ClearOne is the twelve months ending on December 31.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ClearOne and its subsidiaries.
All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
These accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and are not audited.
Certain information and footnote disclosures that are usually included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) have been either condensed or omitted in accordance with SEC rules and regulations.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, and the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.
These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC.
Significant Accounting Policies: 



The significant accounting policies were described in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Recent accounting standard related to leases: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”).
This new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.
Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is permitted.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
2018-11 which provides an alternative transition method that allows entities to apply the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption.
The Company has adopted the requirements of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, the first day of fiscal year 2019, using the optional transition method.
The Company elected to use certain practical expedient options, which allows an entity not to reassess whether any existing or expired contracts contain leases.
There was an increase in assets of $2,966 and liabilities of $3,101 due to the recognition of the required right-of-use asset and corresponding liability for all lease obligations that are currently classified as operating leases with the difference of $135 related to existing deferred rent that reduced the ROU asset recorded.

Accounting policy related to leases: We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception.
Operating leases are included in operating lease - right of use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities, and operating lease liability in our consolidated balance sheets.
As of adoption of ASC 842 and as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company was not party to any finance lease arrangements.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
We use the implicit rate when readily determinable.
The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives.
Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Under the available practical expedient, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
Liquidity: 



As of September 30, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $2,010 compared to $11,211 as of December 31, 2018.

We have already spent approximately $11,877 from 2016 through September 30, 2019 towards this litigation and may be required to spend more to continue our legal defense.
9,813,806) pending a full trial.
We have been actively engaged in preserving cash by suspending our dividend program, allowing our share repurchase program to expire and implementing company-wide cost reduction measures.
We believe all of these and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to meet our operating needs through at least November 15, 2020.

Fair Value Measurements 



The fair value of the Company’s financial instruments reflects the amounts that the Company estimates it will receive in connection with the sale of an asset or pay in connection with the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into the following three levels: 



Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
This category generally includes U.S. Government and agency securities; municipal securities; mutual funds and securities sold and not yet settled.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs.
The substantial majority of the Company’s financial instruments are valued using observable inputs.
The following table sets forth the fair value of the financial instruments re-measured by the Company as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018:
