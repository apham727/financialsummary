Item 3.
For the nine months ended January 27, 2018, net sales originating outside the United States were 16.1 percent of total net sales, of which a portion was denominated in Canadian dollars, Euros, Chinese renminbi, British pounds, Australian dollars, Brazilian reais or other currencies.
If we believed currency risk in any foreign location is significant, we would utilize foreign exchange hedging contracts to manage our exposure to the currency fluctuations.
Over the long term, net sales to international markets are expected to increase as a percentage of total net sales and, consequently, a greater portion of our business could be denominated in foreign currencies.
To the extent we engage in international sales denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets.
This effect is also impacted by sources of raw materials from international sources.
We estimate that a 10 percent change in all foreign exchange rates would impact our reported income before taxes by approximately $1.1 million.
This sensitivity analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area.
We have foreign currency forward agreements in place to offset changes in the value of contracts with customers denominated in a foreign currency.
The notional amount of these derivatives is $10.4 million, and all contracts mature within 19 months.
These contracts are marked to market each balance sheet date and are not designated as hedges.
See "Note 14.
Derivative Financial Instruments" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for further details.
Interest Rate Risks



Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our marketing obligations and long-term accounts receivable.
As of January 27, 2018, our outstanding marketing obligations were $0.5 million, all of which were in fixed rate obligations.

In connection with the sale of certain display systems, we have entered into various types of financing with customers.
The aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element.
The majority of these financings carry fixed rates of interest.
As of January 27, 2018, our outstanding long-term receivables were $4.1 million.
Each 25 basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated immaterial annual opportunity cost.
The following table provides maturities and weighted average interest rates on our financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Of our $49.0 million in cash balances at January 27, 2018, $40.8 million were denominated in U.S. dollars of which $3.7 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
A portion of the cash held in foreign accounts is used to collateralize outstanding bank guarantees issued by our foreign subsidiaries.
Commodity Risk



We are dependent on basic raw materials, sub-assemblies, components, and other supplies used in our operations.
Some of these materials are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or only a single supplier.
These materials are also key source materials for our competitors.
Therefore, if demand for these materials rises, we may experience increased costs and/or limited or unavailable supplies.
Our sourcing group works to implement strategies to mitigate these risks.
Periodically, we enter into pricing agreements or purchasing contracts under which we agree to purchase a minimum amount of product in exchange for guaranteed price terms over the length of the contract, which generally does not exceed one year.
We have been impacted by longer lead times because of worldwide shortages; however, we believe that we have adequate sources of supply for our key materials.
