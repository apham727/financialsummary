Results of Operations: Three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to three months ended June 30, 2017 



Net Sales.
Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales, as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 *  International sales do not include sales of printers and terminals made to domestic distributors or other domestic customers who may in turn ship those printers and terminals to international destinations.
Net sales for the second quarter of 2018 increased $1.2 million, or 8%, from the same period in 2017.
Printer and terminal sales volume increased 6% to approximately 39 thousand units driven primarily by an 81% increase in unit volume from the casino and gaming market and, to a lesser extent, a 14% increase in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market.
These increases were partially offset by an 83% decline in unit volume from the lottery market.
The average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 7% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2018 due primarily to lower lottery printer sales.
International sales for the second quarter of 2018 increased $2.3 million, or 221%, from the same period in 2017 due primarily to a 267% increase in sales in the international casino and gaming market.
Restaurant Solutions: 



Revenue from the restaurant solutions market includes sales of terminals that combine hardware and software (including software sold on a subscription basis) in a device that includes an operating system, touchscreen and one or two thermal print mechanisms that print easy-to-read food rotation labels, grab and go labels for prepared foods, and "enjoy by" date labels to help food service establishments and restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick-serve convenience and hospitality establishments) effectively manage food safety and automate and manage back-of-the-restaurant operations.
A summary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 was driven by the initial shipments of the AccuDate XL to two existing customers in support of large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal.
This increase was partially offset by decreased sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our former U.S. distributor during the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017.
Shipments of AccuDate XL terminals exceeded sales of AccuDate 9700 terminals for the first time in the second quarter of 2018.
We expect sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to continue to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 as we benefit from the strategic selling and marketing investments implemented during 2017.
POS automation and banking: 



Revenue from the POS automation and banking market includes sales of thermal printers used primarily by restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick serve and hospitality establishments) located either at the checkout counter or within self-service kiosks to print receipts for consumers or print on linerless labels.
In addition, revenue includes sales of inkjet printers used by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to print deposit or withdrawal receipts and/or validate checks at bank teller stations.
A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



13 



   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in both domestic and international POS automation and banking product revenue from the second quarter of 2017 was driven by an 21% increase in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald's have returned to the near record levels experienced during 2017.
We expect this level of sales to McDonald's to continue into the third quarter of 2018.
This increase was partially offset by 71% lower sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers for the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017.
Casino and gaming: 



Revenue from the casino and gaming market includes sales of thermal ticket printers used in slot machines, video lottery terminals, and other gaming machines that print tickets or receipts instead of issuing coins at casinos and racetracks and other gaming venues worldwide.
Revenue from this market also includes sales of thermal roll-fed printers used in the international off-premise gaming market in gaming machines such as Amusement with Prizes, Skills with Prizes and Fixed Odds Betting Terminals at non-casino gaming establishments.
Revenue from this market also includes royalties related to our patented casino and gaming technology.
In addition, casino and gaming market revenue includes sales of the EPICENTRAL™ print system, our software solution (including annual software maintenance), that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them real-time at the slot machine.
A summary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due to an 8% increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017, driven primarily by increased sales to our OEMs.
The increase in international sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 was due to a 366% increase in sales of our thermal casino printers and a 153% increase in sales of our off-premise gaming printers in Europe, Australia and Asia.
These increases were due to the early success of the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor whose contract ended at the end of 2017.
We expect international sales of both our thermal casino printers and off-premise gaming printers to continue to increase in the second half of 2018, as we benefit from the transition to selling directly to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe.
Lottery: 



Revenue from the lottery market includes sales of thermal on-line and other lottery printers primarily to International Game Technology and its subsidiaries ("IGT") and, to a lesser extent, other lottery system companies for various lottery applications.
14 



Printrex: 



Printrex branded printers are sold into markets that include wide format, desktop and rack mounted and vehicle mounted black/white thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field, seismic and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry.
It also includes high-speed color inkjet desktop printers used to print logs at the data centers of the oil and gas field service companies.
Revenue in this market also includes sales of vehicle mounted printers used to print schematics and certain other critical information in emergency services vehicles and other mobile printing applications.
This increase was partially offset by 76% lower sales of our medical and mobile printers in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017.
TSG: 



Revenue from TSG includes sales of consumable products (inkjet cartridges, ribbons, receipt paper, color thermal paper, food safety labels and other printing supplies), replacement parts, maintenance and repair services, testing services, refurbished printers, and shipping and handling charges.
Replacement part sales decreased 6% due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
Service revenue declined 9% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 due to paper testing sales that occurred in 2017 but did not repeat in 2018.
The decrease in Non-Printrex consumables was partially offset by AccuDate label sales which nearly tripled in second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased due to a 98% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017.
Gross Profit.
In the second quarter of 2018, gross profit increased $561 thousand, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2017 and our gross margin improved slightly by 10 basis points.
The increase in gross profit was driven by 8% higher sales in the second quarter of 2018.
15 



Operating Expenses - Engineering, Design and Product Development.
Such expenses increased $163 thousand, or 16% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 due primarily to the hiring of additional engineering staff and increased prototype expenses to support new product development in the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
We expect engineering, design and product development expenses to be higher for the full year 2018 compared to full year 2017, due to the expanded engineering staff to support new product development for the restaurant solutions market.
Operating Expenses - Selling and Marketing.
Such expenses increased by $45 thousand, or 2%, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 due primarily to the hiring of additional sales staff in the U.K. to support our new direct selling model for the casino and gaming market in Europe.
This increase was partially offset by the retirement of our EVP, Sales and Marketing in December 2017, whose position was replaced by an existing employee of TransAct, as well as the elimination of commission expense to our former international casino and gaming distributor, Suzo-Happ.
Operating Expenses - General and Administrative.
General and administrative expense information for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



General and administrative expenses primarily include salaries, incentive compensation, and other payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resource and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company.
General and administrative expenses increased $41 thousand, or 2%, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 due primarily to higher incentive compensation expenses and legal expenses incurred during 2018.
We expect general and administrative expenses in 2018 to be higher than 2017 due to increased recruiting expenses related to the expansion our restaurant solutions sales staff, sales staff for our European casino and gaming market, and engineering staff.
Operating Income.
Operating income information for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Our operating income increased $312 thousand, or 24%, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017, and our operating margin increased to 11% of net sales largely due to higher gross profit resulting from an 8% increase in sales, as well as proportionately lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year period.
16 



Interest expense.
We recorded net interest expense of $6 thousand in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $8 thousand in the second quarter of 2017.
We do not expect significant changes in net interest expense for the remainder of 2018.
Other expense, net.
We recorded other expense of $97 thousand in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $2 thousand in the second quarter of 2017 due to higher foreign exchange losses recorded by our U.K. entity in the second quarter of 2018.
The effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2018 was lower than the effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2017 due to the passage of the Tax Reform Act that was signed on December 22, 2017.
Net Income.
We reported net income for the second quarter of 2018 of $1.2 million, or $0.16 per diluted share compared to $867 thousand, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2017.
Results of Operations: Six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to six months ended June 30, 2017 



Net Sales.
Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales, as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 *  International sales do not include sales of printers and terminals made to domestic distributors or other domestic customers who may in turn ship those printers and terminals to international destinations.
Net sales for the first half of 2018 decreased $599 thousand, or 2%, from the same period in 2017.
Although unit volume decreased in the first six months of 2018 primarily due to the decreased volume of lottery printers sold during the first half of 2018, which carry lower prices than our other products, the average selling price of our printers increased 11% during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. 



International sales increased $920 thousand, or 20%, primarily driven by 65% higher international sales in the casino and gaming market.
This increase was partially offset by a $1.1 million sales decrease in our international lottery market during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017.
17 



Restaurant solutions: 



A summary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 was primarily driven by increased sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal during the first half of 2018 and the initial shipments of the AccuDate XL to two large corporate customers in support of a large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal.
International restaurant solutions sales increased during the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 due to increased sales of the AccuDate 9700 for McDonald's through our Asian distributor.
POS automation and banking: 



A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 was primarily driven by a 72% decrease in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers during the first half of 2018 as we continue to deemphasize these products.
Casino and gaming: 



A summary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due primarily to a 13% increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017, driven primarily by increased sales to our OEMs.
The increase in international sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 was due to a 118% increase of thermal casino printer sales and, to a lesser extent, a 13% increase in international sales of off-premise gaming printers.
These increases were due to the early success of the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor and using our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers in Europe.
The decrease in international lottery sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 was due to a sale of lottery printers to IGT for the Canadian lottery in the first half of 2017 and no comparable sale occurring in the first half of 2018.
Printrex: 



A summary of sales of our worldwide Printrex printers for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in domestic Printrex sales in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017 resulted from higher domestic sales in the oil and gas market due to a continued recovery in the oil and gas market.
TSG: 



A summary of sales in our worldwide TSG market for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG in the first half of 2018 as compared to the first half of 2017 was due primarily to decreased replacement part sales, service revenue and non-Printrex consumable product sales.
Replacement part sales decreased 6% due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
Service revenue declined 10% in the first half of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to paper testing sales that occurred in the 2017 period but did not repeat in the 2018 period.
The decrease in Non-Printrex consumables was partially offset by AccuDate label sales which more than quadrupled in the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased primarily due to a 57% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 



Cash Flow 



In the first six months of 2018, our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $1.8 million, or 32%, from December 31, 2017 and we ended the second quarter of 2018 with $3.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1.2 million was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding.
Operating activities: The following significant factors affected our cash provided by operating activities of $2.5 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to our cash provided by operating activities of $4.0 million in the first six months of 2017: 



During the first six months of 2018: 



  ●  We reported net income of $1.9 million.
●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $480 thousand, and share-based compensation expense of $337 thousand.
●  Accounts receivable decreased $678 thousand, or 6%, due largely to the collection of past due receivables for 2017 sales made to our former international casino and gaming distributor.
●  Inventories increased $2.5 million, or 28%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales in the casino and gaming and restaurant solutions markets.
●  Prepaid income taxes decreased $228 thousand during the first six months of 2018.
●  Accounts payable increased $1.4 million, or 36%, due to increased inventory purchases made during the first six months of 2018.
●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $188 thousand, or 5%, due primarily to the payment of 2017 annual bonuses in March 2018, partially offset by increased customer payments.
During the first six months of 2017: 



  ●  We reported net income of $1.8 million     



  ●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $602 thousand, and share-based compensation expense of $296 thousand.
●  Accounts receivable decreased $3.2 million, or 30%, due to the collection of receivables related to sales made in the fourth quarter of 2016.
●  Prepaid income taxes increased $209 thousand due to the timing of estimated income tax payments made in the first half of 2017.
●  Accounts payable decreased $1.5 million, or 31%, due primarily to increased inventory purchases towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 and subsequently paid in the first half of 2017.
Investing activities: Our capital expenditures, including capitalized software costs, were $751 thousand and $409 thousand in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Expenditures in the 2018 period were primarily for computer and networking equipment and furniture and fixtures purchases related to investments made in our U.K. facility to support the build-out of our internal sales infrastructure to sell directly to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers.
To a lesser extent, expenditures in the 2018 period included computer and networking equipment for our U.S. operations and leasehold improvements made at our Las Vegas facility.
Expenditures in the first six months of 2017 were primarily for computer and networking equipment and, to a lesser extent, new product tooling equipment and purchases of furniture and fixtures.
Financing activities: We used $3.5 million of cash from financing activities during the first six months of 2018 to purchase $2.0 million of common stock for treasury, pay dividends of $1.3 million to common shareholders and $265 thousand related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $108 thousand.
During the first six months of 2017, we used $1.2 million of cash from financing activities to pay dividends of $1.3 million to common shareholders and $18 thousand related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $85 thousand.
Credit Facility and Borrowings 



We maintain a credit facility (the "TD Bank Credit Facility") with TD Bank N.A., which provides for a $20 million revolving credit line.
On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022.
Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all of our assets.
We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line.
The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12.5 million from $10 million.
The TD Bank Credit Facility imposes certain quarterly financial covenants on us and restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the creation of other liens.
We were in compliance with all financial covenants of the TD Bank Credit Facility at June 30, 2018.
The following table lists the financial covenants and the performance measurements at June 30, 2018: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of June 30, 2018, borrowings available under the TD Bank Credit facility were $20 million.
Shareholder Dividend Payments 



In 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the Board's approval each quarter.
Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017.
Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $663 thousand, or $0.09 per share in both the second quarter of 2018 and second quarter of 2017.
We expect to pay approximately $2.7 million in cash dividends to our common shareholders during the full year 2018.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, dividends declared and paid totaled $1.3 million, or $0.18 per share and $1.3 million, or $0.17 per share, respectively.
Stock Repurchase Program 



On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the "2018 Stock Repurchase Program").
The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue the repurchase program prior to such time.
We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account.
Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we repurchased 156,510 shares of our common stock for approximately $2.0 million at an average price per share of $12.78.
During the six months ended June 30, 2107, we purchased no shares of our common stock.
Resource Sufficiency 



We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our expected cash flows generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our TD Bank Credit Facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and dividend payments and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months.
Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 



The disclosure of payments we have committed to make under our contractual obligations is set forth under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2017.
We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
