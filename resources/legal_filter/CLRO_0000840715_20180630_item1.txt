1. Business Description, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies 



Business Description: 



ClearOne, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “ClearOne” or the “Company”), is a global market leader enabling conferencing, collaboration, and network streaming solutions.
The performance and simplicity of our advanced, comprehensive solutions offer unprecedented levels of functionality, reliability and scalability.
Basis of Presentation: 



The fiscal year for ClearOne is the 12 months ending on December 31.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ClearOne and its subsidiaries.
All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
These accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and are not audited.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.
These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the SEC.
Significant Accounting Policies: 



The significant accounting policies were described in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Adoption of New Revenue Standard: On January 1, 2018, as required, the Company adopted ASU No.
2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), ASU No.
2015-14 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date (“ASU 2015-14”), ASU No.
2016-08 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (“ASU 2016-08”), ASU No.
2016-10 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (“ASU 2016-10”), ASU No.
2016-12 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (“ASU 2016-12”) and ASU No.
2016-20 - Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2016-20”) (collectively “the New Revenue Standard”).
To conform to the New Revenue Standard, the Company modified its revenue recognition policy as described further below.
Change in Accounting Policy: On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the New Revenue Standard using the modified retrospective method, applying the guidance to all open contracts and recognized an adjustment to increase retained earnings by $2,783, reduce deferred product revenue by $4,338 and reduce distributor channel inventories by $1,555 as of that date.
The comparative financial information has not been restated and continues to be presented under the accounting standards in effect for the respective periods.
The Company applied the practical expedient and has not disclosed the revenue allocated to future shipments of partially completed contracts.
Further, with respect to distributors and other channel partners not reporting the channel inventory, the revenue and associated cost of goods sold were deferred until we received payment for the product sales made to such distributors or channel partners.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, revenue increased by $271 and during the six months ended June 30, 2018 revenue decreased by $581 due to the impact of the adoption of the New Revenue Standard.
Revenue Recognition Policy: The Company generates revenue from sales of its audio and video conferencing equipment to distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers.
The Company also generates revenue, to a much lesser extent, from sale of software and licenses to distributors, system integrators, value-added resellers and end-users.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation in an amount reflecting the consideration to which it expects to be entitled.
For sales agreements, the Company has identified the promise to transfer products, each of which are distinct, to be the performance obligation.
The Company applies a five-step approach in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with a customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied.
Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at the time control of the products transfers to the customer.
Sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply, but typically do not require mandatory purchase commitments.
In the absence of a sales agreement, the Company’s standard terms and conditions at the time of acceptance of purchase orders apply.
The Company considers the customer purchase orders, governed by sales agreements or the Company’s standard terms and conditions, to be the contract with the customer.
In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled.
Although payment terms vary, most distributor agreements require payment within 45 days of invoicing.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation.
The Company recognizes revenue from sales agreements upon transferring control of a product to the customer.
Revenue recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 for equipment sales was $6,803 and $13,900, respectively, and for software, licenses, etc.
was $168 and $360, respectively.
Sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience.
The Company reviews warranty and related claims activity and records provisions, as necessary.
Frequently, the Company receives orders with multiple delivery dates that may extend across reporting periods.
Since each delivery constitutes a performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling price of the products.
The Company invoices the customer for each delivery upon shipment and recognizes revenues in accordance with delivery terms.
Although payment terms vary, distributors typically pay within 45 days of invoicing and dealers pay within 30 days of invoicing.
As scheduled delivery dates are within one year, revenue allocated to future shipments of partially completed contracts are not disclosed.

Fair Value Measurements 



The fair value of the Company’s financial instruments reflects the amounts that the Company estimates it will receive in connection with the sale of an asset or pay in connection with the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into the following three levels: 



Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
This category generally includes U.S. Government and agency securities; municipal securities; mutual funds and securities sold and not yet settled.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs.
The substantial majority of the Company’s financial instruments are valued using observable inputs.
The following table sets forth the fair value of the financial instruments re-measured by the Company as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017:
