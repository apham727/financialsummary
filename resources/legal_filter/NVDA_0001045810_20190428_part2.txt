ITEM 2.
Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $7.08 billion through April 28, 2019.
All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock.
As of April 28, 2019, we were authorized to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.
The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases.
The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.
As previously communicated, we intend to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
