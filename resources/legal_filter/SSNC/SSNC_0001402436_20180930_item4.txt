Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
As a result of the DST acquisition on April 16, 2018, we have implemented internal controls over financial reporting to include consolidation of DST. The DST operations utilize separate information and accounting systems and processes. Our management is in the process of reviewing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting relating to the DST operations.
