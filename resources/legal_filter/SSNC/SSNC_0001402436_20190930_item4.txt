Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We implemented changes to internal controls due to the adoption of Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Accounting Standard Codification Topic 842) effective January 1, 2019. These changes included new lease accounting processes to evaluate and account for contracts under the new accounting standard. There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting due to the adoption of the new standard.
