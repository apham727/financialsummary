Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We have generally invested our available cash in short-term, highly liquid financial instruments, having initial maturities of three months or less. When necessary, we have borrowed to fund acquisitions. 
Interest rate risk 
We derive service revenues from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in bank accounts on which we are the agent for clients. The balances maintained in the bank accounts will fluctuate. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, we had average daily cash balances of approximately $2.3 billion maintained in such accounts. We estimate that a 100 basis point change in the interest earnings rate would equal approximately $9.3 million of net income on an annual basis. The effect of changes in interest rates attributable to earnings derived from cash balances we hold for clients is offset by changes in interest rates on our variable debt.
