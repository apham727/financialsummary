 Note 1 — The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates



The Company 



Logitech International S.A, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, ("Logitech" or the "Company") designs, manufactures and markets products that help connect people to digital and cloud experiences.
More than 35 years ago, Logitech created products to improve experiences around the personal PC platform, and today it is a multi-brand, multi-category company designing products that enable better experiences consuming, sharing and creating any digital content such as music, gaming, video and computing, whether it is on a computer, mobile device or in the cloud.
The Company sells its products to a broad network of domestic and international customers, including direct sales to retailers and e-tailers and indirect sales through distributors.
Logitech was founded in Switzerland in 1981 and Logitech International S.A. has been the parent holding company of Logitech since 1988.
Logitech International S.A. is a Swiss holding company with its registered office in Apples, Switzerland and headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, which conducts its business through subsidiaries in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and Asia Pacific.
Shares of Logitech International S.A. are listed on both the SIX Swiss Exchange under the trading symbol LOGN and the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol LOGI.
Basis of Presentation



The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Logitech and its subsidiaries.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and therefore do not include all the information required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 17, 2019.
In the opinion of management, these condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of only normal and recurring adjustments, necessary and in all material aspects, for a fair statement of the results of operations, comprehensive income, financial position, cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity for the periods presented.
Operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, or any future periods.
Changes in Significant Accounting Policies



Other than the recent accounting pronouncements adopted and discussed below under Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, there have been no changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies during the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared with the significant accounting policies described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
Use of Estimates



The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable.
Significant estimates and assumptions made by management involve the fair value of goodwill, intangible assets acquired from business acquisitions, valuation of operating right-of-use assets, warranty liabilities, accruals for customer incentives, cooperative marketing, and pricing programs (Customer Programs) and related breakage when appropriate, accrued sales return liability, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, share-based compensation expense, uncertain tax positions, and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" (ASU 2016-02 or Topic 842), which requires a lessee to recognize right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities arising from operating and financing leases with terms longer than 12 months on the consolidated balance sheets and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements.
The Company adopted the new standard effective April 1, 2019 and recorded an ROU asset and lease liability related to its operating leases.
The Company used the modified retrospective approach with the effective date as the date of initial application.
Accordingly, the Company applied the new lease standard prospectively to leases existing or commencing on or after April 1, 2019.
Prior period balances and disclosures have not been restated.
The Company elected the package of transitional practical expedients, which among other provisions, allows the Company to not reassess under the new standard the Company's prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct cost, for any existing leases on the adoption date.
In addition, for operating leases, the Company elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
The Company also made an accounting policy election to not recognize lease liabilities and ROU assets on its condensed consolidated balance sheet for leases that, at the lease commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less.
Adoption of the standard resulted in the recognition of $31.3 million of ROU assets and $37.4 million of lease liabilities related to the Company's leases on its condensed consolidated balance sheet on April 1, 2019.
The difference of $6.1 million represented deferred rent for leases that existed as of the date of adoption, which decreased the opening balance of ROU assets.
In addition, the prepaid rent balance as of the date of adoption increased the opening balance of ROU assets.
The deferred rent and prepaid rent balances were derecognized as of the date of adoption and no adjustment was made to retained earnings.
The adoption of the standard did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated statement of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity or cash flows.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract" (ASU 2018-15), which clarifies that implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements are deferred if they would be capitalized by customers in software licensing arrangements under the internal-use software guidance.
ASU 2018-15 is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted.
Entities have the option to apply the guidance prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption or retrospectively.
The Company adopted this standard effective April 1, 2019 using a prospective adoption method.
The adoption of ASU 2018-15 did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements to be Adopted



In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements" (ASU 2018-13), which aims to improve the overall usefulness of disclosures to financial statement users and reduce unnecessary costs to companies when preparing fair value measurement disclosures.
ASU 2018-13 is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
Early adoption is permitted.
Retrospective adoption is required, except for certain disclosures which will be required to be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption.
The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2018-13 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and plans to adopt the standard effective April 1, 2020.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, "Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefits Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans" (ASU 2018-14), which aims to improve the overall usefulness of disclosures to financial statement users and reduce unnecessary costs to companies when preparing defined benefit plan disclosures.
ASU 2018-14 is effective for annual periods in fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020.
Retrospective adoption is required and early 



10

adoption is permitted.
The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2018-14 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and plans to early adopt the standard effective April 1, 2020.
Note 2 — Net Income Per Share



The following table summarizes the computations of basic and diluted net income per share for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 (in thousands, except per share amounts):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Share equivalents attributable to outstanding stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs") and employee share purchase rights (ESPP) totaling 2.0 million and 1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share because the combined exercise price and average unamortized grant date fair value upon exercise of these options and ESPP or vesting of RSUs were greater than the average market price of the Company's shares during the periods presented herein, and therefore their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
Performance-based awards were not included because all necessary conditions have not been satisfied by the end of the respective period, and those shares were not issuable if the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period.
Note 3 — Employee Benefit Plans



Employee Share Purchase Plans and Stock Incentive Plans



As of June 30, 2019, the Company offers the 2006 Employee Share Purchase Plan, as amended and restated (Non-U.S.) (2006 ESPP), the 1996 Employee Share Purchase Plan (U.S.), as amended and restated (1996 ESPP), the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (2006 Plan), and the 2012 Stock Inducement Equity Plan (2012 Plan).
The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense and total income tax benefit recognized for share-based awards for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



11

The income tax benefit in the respective period primarily consists of tax benefit related to the share-based compensation expense for the period and direct tax benefit realized, including net excess tax benefits recognized from share-based awards vested or exercised during the period.
As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the balance of capitalized share-based compensation included in inventory was $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
Defined Benefit Plans



Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans or non-retirement post-employment benefits covering substantially all of their employees.
Benefits are provided based on employees’ years of service and earnings, or in accordance with applicable employee benefit regulations.
The Company’s practice is to fund amounts sufficient to meet the requirements set forth in the applicable employee benefit and tax regulations.
The costs recorded of $2.4 million and $2.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were primarily related to service costs.
The income tax provision for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was $6.5 million based on an effective income tax rate of 12.6% of pre-tax income, compared to an income tax benefit of $5.2 million based on an effective income tax rate of (15.7)% of pre-tax income for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
On May 19, 2019, the Swiss electorate approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing ("TRAF"), a major reform to better align the Swiss tax system with international tax standards.
The tax reform is expected to take effect on January 1, 2020.
As of June 30, 2019, TRAF has not been enacted as the federal and cantonal legislative procedures are in process.
The change in the effective income tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the same period ended June 30, 2018, was primarily due to the mix of income and losses in the various tax jurisdictions which the Company operates and the transitional income tax impact in Switzerland.
The Company has benefited from a longstanding tax ruling from the canton of Vaud through March 31, 2019.
In the three months ended June 30, 2019, there was a discrete tax provision of $2.3 million to record net deferred tax liability in Switzerland.
Furthermore, there were discrete tax benefits of $5.8 million and $1.2 million from the recognition of excess tax benefits in the United States and reversal of uncertain tax positions from the expiration of statutes of limitations, respectively, in the three-month period ended June 30, 2019, compared with $8.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively, in the three-month period ended June 30, 2018.
As of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertain tax positions was $77.3 million and $76.5 million, respectively, all of which would affect the effective income tax rate if recognized.
As of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company had $36.1 million and $36.4 million, respectively, in non-current income taxes payable including interest and penalties, related to the Company's income tax liability for uncertain tax positions.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in income tax provision.
As of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company had $2.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
Although the Company has adequately provided for uncertain tax positions, the provisions on these positions may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.
During fiscal year 2020, the Company continues to review its tax positions and provide for or reverse unrecognized tax benefits as they arise.
During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax 



12

benefits could increase or decrease significantly due to changes in tax law in various jurisdictions, new tax audits and changes in the U.S. dollar as compared to other currencies.
Excluding these factors, uncertain tax positions may decrease by as much as $3.7 million from the lapse of the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions during the next twelve months.

Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements



Fair Value Measurements



The Company considers fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The Company utilizes the following three-level fair value hierarchy to establish the priorities of the inputs used to measure fair value:



•Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, such as: quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
•Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
14

The following table presents the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding assets related to the Company’s defined benefit pension plans, classified by the level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands): 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Investment Securities



The marketable securities for the Company's deferred compensation plan were recorded at a fair value of $23.4 million and $20.4 million, as of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively, based on quoted market prices.
Quoted market prices are observable inputs that are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
Unrealized gains (losses) related to trading securities for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were not material and are included in other income (expense), net in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Equity Method Investments



The Company has certain non-marketable investments included in other assets that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with a carrying value of $7.0 million and $6.6 million as of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.
Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis



Financial Assets.
The Company has certain investments without readily determinable fair values due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity, and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management's judgment.
When certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, the Company revalues the investments using various assumptions, including the financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies.
The carrying value is also adjusted for observable price changes with a same or similar security from the same issuer.
The amount of these investments included in other assets as of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019 was $9.5 million.
There was no impairment of these assets during the three months ended June 30, 2019 or 2018.
Non-Financial Assets.
The Company’s non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and acquisition-related property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value only upon initial recognition or if an impairment is recognized.
There was no impairment of these assets during the three months ended June 30, 2019 or 2018.
Note 7 — Derivative Financial Instruments



Under certain agreements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, subject to applicable requirements, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions of the same type with a single net 



15

amount payable by one party to the other.
However, the Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019.
The fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments was not material as of June 30, 2019 or March 31, 2019.
The amount of gain (loss) recognized on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments was not material in all periods presented herein.
The following table presents the amounts of gains (losses) on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments and their locations on its condensed consolidated statements of operations and condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Cash Flow Hedges



The Company enters into cash flow hedge contracts to protect against exchange rate exposure of forecasted inventory purchases.
These hedging contracts mature within four months.
Gains and losses in the fair value of the effective portion of the hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged inventory purchases are sold, at which time the gains or losses are reclassified to cost of goods sold.
Cash flows from such hedges are classified as operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
Hedging relationships are discontinued when hedging contract is no longer eligible for hedge accounting, or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when Company removes hedge designation for the contract.
Gains and losses in the fair value of the effective portion of the discontinued hedges continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged inventory purchases are sold, unless it is probable that the forecasted inventory purchases will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter.
In all periods presented herein, there have been no forecasted inventory purchases that were probable to not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter.
The notional amounts of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding related to forecasted inventory purchases were $68.2 million as of June 30, 2019 and $41.4 million as of March 31, 2019.
The Company had $0.8 million of net losses related to its cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of June 30, 2019 which will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.
Other Derivatives



The Company also enters into foreign currency exchange forward and swap contracts to reduce the short-term effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain receivables or payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of its subsidiaries.
These contracts generally mature within one month.
The primary risk managed by using forward and swap contracts is the currency exchange rate risk.
The gains or losses on these contracts are recognized in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations based on the changes in fair value.
The notional amounts of these contracts outstanding as of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019 were $53.2 million and $50.4 million, respectively.
Open forward and swap contracts outstanding as of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019 consisted of contracts in Mexican Pesos, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollars, Taiwan New Dollars and Australian Dollars to be settled at future dates at pre-determined exchange rates.
The fair value of all foreign currency exchange forward and swap contracts is determined based on observable market transactions of spot currency rates and forward rates.
Cash flows from these contracts are classified as operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
Note 8 — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets



The Company conducts its impairment analysis of goodwill annually at December 31 and as necessary, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount.
There have been no events or circumstances during the three months ended June 30, 2019 that have required the Company to perform an interim assessment of goodwill.
16

The following table summarizes the activities in the Company’s goodwill balance during the three months ended June 30, 2019 (in thousands):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Company's acquired intangible assets subject to amortization were as follows (in thousands):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Note 9 — Financing Arrangements



The Company had several uncommitted, unsecured bank lines of credit aggregating $79.3 million as of June 30, 2019.
There are no financial covenants under these lines of credit with which the Company must comply.
As of June 30, 2019, the Company had outstanding bank guarantees of $15.7 million under these lines of credit.
There was no borrowing outstanding under these lines of credit as of June 30, 2019 or March 31, 2019.
The scope of these indemnities varies, but in some instances, includes indemnification for damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
As of June 30, 2019, no amounts have been accrued for these indemnification provisions.
The Company does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be required to be paid under its indemnification arrangements.
The Company also indemnifies its current and former directors and certain of its current and former officers.
Certain costs incurred for providing such indemnification may be recoverable under various insurance policies.
The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the maximum amount that could be payable under these arrangements because these exposures are not limited, the obligations are conditional in nature and the facts and circumstances involved in any situation that might arise are variable.
17

Legal Proceedings



From time to time the Company is involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business.
The Company is currently subject to several such claims and a small number of legal proceedings.
The Company believes that these matters lack merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.
Any claims or proceedings against the Company, whether meritorious or not, can have an adverse impact because of defense costs, diversion of management and operational resources, negative publicity and other factors.
Note 11 — Shareholders’ Equity



Share Repurchase Program



In March 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 2017 share buyback program, which authorizes the Company to use up to $250.0 million to purchase up to 17.3 million shares of its own shares.
The Company's share buyback program is expected to remain in effect for a period of three years.
Shares may be repurchased from time to time on the open market, through block trades or otherwise.
Purchases may be started or stopped at any time without prior notice depending on market conditions and other factors.
As of June 30, 2019, $172.4 million is still available for repurchase under the 2017 buyback program.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)



The accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was as follows (in thousands):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note 12 — Segment Information



The Company has determined that it operates in a single operating segment that encompasses the design, manufacturing and marketing of peripherals for PCs, tablets and other digital platforms.
Operating performance measures are provided directly to the Company's CEO, who is considered to be the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The CEO periodically reviews information such as sales and adjusted operating income (loss) to make business decisions.
These operating performance measures do not include restructuring charges (credits), net, share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, charges from the purchase accounting effect on inventory, acquisition-related costs or change in fair value of contingent consideration from business acquisition.
18

Property, plant and equipment, net in Switzerland, the Company’s home domicile, were $2.0 million and $1.7 million as of June 30, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively.
Note 13 — Restructuring



During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, the Company implemented a restructuring plan to streamline and realign the Company's overall organizational structure and reallocate resources to support long-term growth opportunities.
In July 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved additional costs under this restructuring plan, totaling pre-tax charges of approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million, of which $11.8 million has been recognized cumulatively as of June 30, 2019.
The total charges consisted of cash severance and other personnel costs and are presented as restructuring charges, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, and the accrual balances are presented in accrued and other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
As of June 30, 2019, the Company has substantially completed this restructuring plan.
The following table summarizes restructuring related activities during the three months ended June 30, 2019 (in thousands):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Note 14 — Leases



The Company is a lessee in several noncancellable operating leases, primarily real estate facilities for office space and for transportation and office equipment.
The Company accounts for leases in accordance with Topic 842 (see Note 1) and determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at contract inception.
ROU assets are included in other assets, short-term lease liabilities are included in accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term lease liabilities are included in other non-current liabilities on the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.
For the Company's operating leases, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
For operating leases, the lease liability is initially and subsequently measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at lease commencement date.
Topic 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if the rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate.
As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable for the Company's operating leases, the Company generally uses an incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the lease.
The Company's incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms.
Because the Company does not generally borrow in a collateralized basis, it uses its understanding of what its collateralized credit rating would be as an input to deriving an appropriate incremental borrowing rate.
The operating lease right-of-use asset includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives.
The Company's lease arrangements comprise of operating leases with various expiration dates through December 31, 2030.
The lease term for all of the Company’s leases includes the noncancellable period of the lease.
Certain lease agreements include options to renew or terminate the lease, which are not reasonably certain to be exercised and therefore are not factored into our determination of the duration of the lease arrangement.
The Company's leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees.
For the three months ended June 30, 2019, the total operating lease costs were $3.3 million, which included short-term lease costs and sublease income.
Total variable lease costs were immaterial during the three months ended June 30, 2019.
The total operating and variable lease costs were included in cost of goods sold, marketing 



20

and selling, research and development, and general and administrative in the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations.

ITEM 1.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



From time-to-time we are involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business.
We are currently subject to several such claims and a small number of legal proceedings.
We believe that these matters lack merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them.
ITEM 1A.
Customers generally order on an as-needed basis and we typically do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers.
•We must incur a large portion of our costs in advance of sales orders because we must plan research and production, order components, buy tooling equipment, and enter into development, sales and marketing, and other operating commitments prior to obtaining firm commitments from our customers.
•We engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and such activity varies from period to period.
•We have attempted to simplify our organization, to reduce operating costs through expense reduction and global workforce reductions, to reduce the complexity of our product portfolio, and to better align costs with our current business as we expand from PC accessories to growth opportunities in accessories and other products for music, gaming, video collaboration, digital home, mobile devices and other product categories.
We attempt to adjust product prices over time to offset the impact of currency movements.
37

Our product categories are characterized by short product life cycles, intense competition, frequent new product introductions, rapidly changing technology, dynamic consumer demand and evolving industry standards.
As a result, we must continually innovate in our new and existing product categories, introduce new products and technologies, and enhance existing products in order to remain competitive.
In addition, if we do not continue to differentiate our products through distinctive, technologically advanced features, designs, and services that are appealing to our customers and consumers, as well as continue to build and strengthen our brand recognition and our access to distribution channels, our business could be adversely affected.
The development of new products and services can be very difficult and requires high levels of innovation.
The development process also can be lengthy and costly.
There are significant initial expenditures for research and development, tooling, manufacturing processes, inventory and marketing, and we may not be able to recover those investments.
We have historically targeted peripherals for the PC platform.
Consumer demand for PCs, especially in our traditional, mature markets such as North America, Western and Nordic Europe, Japan and Australia, has been declining or flat for several years, and such trends may continue in the future.
This has put pressure on consumer demand for PC peripherals in many of our markets and may cause sales growth of our PC peripherals to slow and, in some cases, decline.
We expect this trend may continue.
Global economic concerns, such as the varying pace of global economic recovery, political uncertainties created by policy changes such as Brexit, tariffs and policies that inhibit trade, the impact of sovereign debt issues in Europe, the impact of oil prices on Russia and other countries, conflicts with either local or global financial implications and economic slowdown in China, create unpredictability and add risk to our future outlook.
As a result, we are attempting to diversify our product category portfolio and focusing more of our attention, which may include personnel, financial resources and management attention, on product innovations and growth opportunities, including products for gaming, products for video collaboration, products for the consumption of digital music, products for the digital home, and on other potential growth opportunities in addition to our PC peripherals product categories.
Creativity & Productivity.
Despite slowing or declines in sales of PCs, our pointing devices, keyboards, webcams and other PC peripherals have continued to see some growth as a result of consumers refreshing their existing PCs, product innovation and new consumer trends, such as social content creation.
Gaming.
We are building a diverse business that features a variety of gaming peripherals.
Video Collaboration.
While we view the small and medium sized user groups opportunity to be large and relatively unaddressed, this is a new and evolving market segment that we and our competitors are developing.
In order to continue to grow in this opportunity, we may need to further build and scale our own enterprise sales force, a capability that several of our competitors in this category already have.
Music.
We are focused on products for the consumption of digital music as a sales growth area.
Competition in the mobile speaker and headphone categories is intense, and we expect it to increase.
Moreover, the market for mobile speakers appears to be maturing with slower growth or even declining.
Smart Home.
While we are a leader in programmable, performance remote controls for home entertainment, the smart home market is still in its early stages and it is not yet clear when the category will produce dynamic growth or which products will succeed and be able to take advantage of market growth or to help define and grow the market.
Each of these growth categories and many of the growth opportunities that we may pursue are subject to constant and rapidly changing and evolving technologies and evolving industry standards and may be replaced by new technology concepts or platforms.
In addition, some of these growth categories and opportunities are characterized by price competition, erosion of premium-priced segments and average selling prices, commoditization, and sensitivity to general economic conditions and cyclical downturns.
The growth opportunities and strength and number of competitors that we face in all of our product categories mean that 



39

we are at risk of new competitors coming to market with more innovative products that are more attractive to customers than ours or priced more competitively.
We have developed long-term value in our brands and have invested significantly in design and in our existing and new brands over the past several years.
We believe that our design and brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business and that maintaining and enhancing our brands is very important to our future growth and success.
Our brands and reputation are also dependent on third parties, such as suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, product reviewers and the media as well as online consumer product reviews, consumer recommendations and referrals.
It can take significant time, resources and expense to overcome negative publicity, reviews or perception.
The peripherals industry is intensely competitive.
Most of our product categories are characterized by large, well-financed competitors with strong brand names and highly effective research and development, marketing and sales capabilities, short product life cycles, continual performance enhancements, and rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors in our retail markets.
Many of our competitors have broad product portfolios across several of our product categories and are able to use the strength of their brands to move into adjacent categories.
Our competitors have the ability to bring new products to market quickly and at competitive prices.
We experience aggressive price competition and other promotional activities from our primary competitors and from less-established brands, including brands owned by retail customers known as house brands.
In addition, our competitors may offer customers terms and conditions that may be more favorable than our terms and conditions and may require us to take actions to increase our customer incentive programs, which could impact our revenues and operating margins.
In recent years, we have expanded the categories of products we sell and entered new markets.
We remain alert to opportunities in new categories and markets.
As we do so, we are confronting new competitors, many of which have more experience in the categories or markets and have greater marketing resources and brand name recognition than we have.
In addition, because of the continuing convergence of the markets for computing devices and consumer electronics, we expect greater competition in the future from well-established consumer electronics companies in our developing categories as well as in future categories we might enter.
Many of these companies, such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, Cisco, Sony Corporation, Samsung and others, have greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we have.
Microsoft, Apple, Google and Amazon are leading producers of operating systems, hardware, platforms and applications with which our mice, keyboards, wireless speakers and other products are designed to operate.
In addition, Microsoft, Apple, Google and Amazon each has significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than Logitech, as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base.
As a result, Microsoft, Apple, Google and Amazon each may be able to improve the functionality of its products, if any, or may choose to show preference to our competitors' products, to correspond with ongoing enhancements to its operating systems, hardware and software applications before we are able to make such improvements.
This ability could provide Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon or other competitors with significant lead-time advantages.
In addition, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon or other competitors may be able to control distribution channels or offer pricing advantages on bundled hardware and software products that we may not be able to offer, and maybe financially 



40

positioned to exert significant downward pressure on product prices and upward pressure on promotional incentives in order to gain market share.
Creativity & Productivity



Pointing Devices.
Apple, Microsoft and HP are our main competitors worldwide.
We also experience competition and pricing pressure from less-established brands, including house brands and local competitors in Asian markets such as Elecom, Buffalo, Rapoo and Xiaomi.
Keyboards & Combo.
Microsoft and Apple are our main competitors in our PC keyboard and combo product lines.
We also experience competition and pricing pressure for keyboard and combos from less-established brands, including house brands and local competitors in Asian markets.
Tablet & Other Accessories.
Competitors in the tablet keyboard market are Apple, Zagg, Kensington, Belkin, Targus and other less-established brands.
Although we are one of the leaders in the tablet keyboard market and continue to bring innovative offerings to the market, we expect the competition may increase.
Competitors in the tablet case market include Apple, Otter, Speck and a large number of small brands.
PC Webcams.
Our primary competitors for PC webcams are Microsoft and other manufacturers taking smaller market share such as Razer.
Gaming 



Competitors for our Gaming products include Razer, Corsair, Component, SteelSeries, Turtle Beach and Kingston, among others.
Video Collaboration 



Our competitors for Video Collaboration products are numerous across various categories with many new entrants.
Competitors include Cisco Systems, Polycom, Inc. (acquired by Plantronics), GN Netcom/Jabra (which recently acquired Altia systems), AVer Information, among others.
Music



Mobile Speakers.
Our competitors for Bluetooth wireless speakers include Bose, Harman (owned by Samsung) and Beats (owned by Apple) among others.
Harman is our largest competitor.
Apple's ownership of Beats may impact our access to shelf space in Apple retail stores and adversely impact our ability to succeed in this important growth market.
Personal voice assistants and other devices that offer music, such as Sonos, Amazon's Echo, Google Home and Apple HomePod also compete with our products.
Amazon is also a significant customer of our products.
Audio & Wearables.
For PC speakers, our competitors include Bose, Cyber Acoustics, Phillips and Creative Labs, Apple and Samsung.
For PC headset, we face numerous competitors, including Plantronics and GN Netcom, among others.
In-ear headphones competitors include Beats, Bose, Apple, Sony, LBL and Sennheiser, and others.
Our competitors for Blue Microphones products include Rode, Audio-Technica, Samson, Shure, Razer and Apogee, among others.
Smart Home



Direct competitors in the remote control market include pro-installer-focused Universal Remote Control and new “DIY” entrants.
Indirect competition exists in the form of low-end “replacement remotes” such as Sony, RCA, GE, pure app-based solutions such as Peel, as well as device and/or subscriber-specific solutions from TV makers such as Samsung and Vizio and multisystem operators, or MSOs, such as Comcast and DirecTV.
Competition in the home control market also exists in form of home automation platforms such as Smart Things (owned by Samsung), Amazon with their Echo product, Google Home and Nest (owned by Alphabet), Wink and many other startups.
Many of these companies also integrate their products with Logitech's smart home and Harmony remote products.
Our peripherals business has historically been built largely around the PC platform, which over time became relatively open, and its inputs and operating system standardized.
With the growth of mobile, tablet, gaming and other computer devices, digital music and personal voice assistants, the number of platforms has grown, and with it the complexity and increased need for us to have business and contractual relationships with the platform owners in order to produce products compatible with these platforms.
Our product portfolio includes current and future products designed for use with third-party platforms or software, such as the Apple iPad, iPod, iPhone and Siri, Android phones and tablets, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.
Our business in these categories relies on our access to the platforms of third parties, some of whom are our competitors.
Platform owners that are competitors have a competitive advantage in designing products for their platforms and may produce peripherals or other products that work better, or are perceived to work better, than our products in connection with those platforms.
As we expand the number of platforms and software applications with which our products are compatible, we may not be successful in launching products for those platforms or software applications, we may not be successful in establishing strong relationships with the new platform or software owners, or we may negatively impact our ability to develop and produce high-quality products on a timely basis for those platforms and software applications or we may otherwise adversely affect our relationships with existing platform or software owners.
We use our forecasts of product demand to make decisions regarding investments of our resources and production levels of our products.
We could also frustrate our customers and lose shelf space.
Over the past few years, we have expanded the types of products we sell and the geographic markets in which we sell them.
In addition, starting in fiscal year 2016, we increased the number of our products that we manufacture in our own facilities.
This increases the inventory that we purchase and maintain to support such manufacturing.
We are also utilizing sea shipments more extensively than air delivery, which will cause us to build and ship products to our distribution centers earlier and will also result in increases in inventory.
These operational shifts increase the risk that we have excess or obsolete inventory if we do not accurately forecast product demand.
We have experienced large differences between our forecasts and actual demand for our products.
We expect other differences between forecasts and actual demand to arise in the future.
42

Our success largely depends on our ability to hire, retain, integrate and motivate sufficient numbers of qualified personnel, including senior management.
Our strategy and our ability to innovate, design and produce new products, sell products, maintain operating margins and control expenses depend on key personnel that may be difficult to replace.
Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, including senior management and international personnel.
From time to time, we experience turnover in some of our senior management positions.
We compensate our employees through a combination of salary, bonuses, benefits and equity compensation.
Recruiting and retaining skilled personnel, including software and hardware engineers, is highly competitive.
If we fail to provide competitive compensation to our employees, it will be difficult to retain, hire and integrate qualified employees and contractors, and we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.
If we do not retain our senior managers or other key employees for any reason, we risk losing institutional knowledge, experience, expertise and other benefits of continuity as well as the ability to attract and retain other key employees.
In addition, we must carefully balance the size of our employee base with our current infrastructure, management resources and anticipated operating cash flows.
Logitech’s practice has been to provide equity incentives to its employees, but the number of shares available for equity grants is limited.
We may find it difficult to provide competitive equity incentives, and our ability to hire, retain and motivate key personnel may suffer.
Recently and in past years, we have initiated reductions in our workforce to align our employee base with our business strategy, our anticipated revenue base or with our areas of focus.
We have also experienced turnover in our workforce.
These reductions and turnover have resulted in reallocations of duties, which could result in employee uncertainty and discontent.
As we expand within and into new product categories, our products in those categories may have lower gross margins than in our traditional product categories.
As a result, we may face higher up-front investments, inventory costs associated with attempting to anticipate consumer preferences, and increased inventory write-offs.
43

As we continue our efforts to lower our costs and improve our operating leverage, we may or may not fully realize our goals.
We restructured our business in fiscal years 2014 through 2016, and we may continue to divest or discontinue non-strategic product categories.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we divested our Lifesize video conferencing business and completed our exit from the OEM business.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we implemented a restructuring plan to streamline and realign our overall organization structure and reallocate resources to support long-term growth opportunities.
We have substantially completed this restructuring during the three months ended June 30, 2019.
There can be no assurance that we will fully realize the desired and anticipated benefits from these activities.
To the extent that we are unable to improve our financial performance, further restructuring measures may be required in the future.
Furthermore, we are expecting to be able to use the anticipated cost savings from these activities to fund and support our current growth opportunities and incremental investments for future growth.
As we grow, explore new opportunities and markets, hire new management and other personnel, and fund research and development, marketing, brand development, sales, operations, investments in intellectual property and acquisitions to support this growth and our new opportunities, some or all of which may not succeed, we expect to experience continued pressure on our cost structure and expenses.
As part of the restructuring plans, we reduced the size of our product portfolio and the assortment of similar products at similar price points within each product category over the past several fiscal years.
While we are constantly replacing products and are dependent on the success of our new products, this product portfolio simplification has made us even more dependent on the success of the new products that we are introducing.
We continue to review our product portfolio and update our non-strategic product categories and products.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we divested our Lifesize video conferencing business and completed our exit from the OEM business.
Discontinuing products with service components may also cause us to continue to incur expenses to maintain services within the product life cycle or to adversely affect our customer and consumer relationships and brand.
In addition, discontinuing product categories, even categories that we consider non-strategic, reduces the size and diversification of our business and causes us to be more dependent on a smaller number of product categories.
We will evaluate acquisition opportunities that could provide us with additional product or service offerings or with additional industry expertise, assets and capabilities.
For example, we acquired ASTRO Gaming to expand into the console gaming market, we acquired Jaybird to expand into the wireless audio wearables market, we acquired Saitek to expand into the gaming simulation and controller markets, and we acquired Blue Microphones to expand into the microphones market.
Acquisitions could result in difficulties integrating acquired operations, products, technology, internal controls, personnel and management teams and result in the diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities.
If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, our business could be harmed.
Several of our past acquisitions have not been successful and have led to impairment charges, including a $122.7 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in fiscal year 2015 related to our Lifesize video conferencing business which is reported in discontinued operations.
In addition, from time to time we make strategic venture investments in other companies that provide products and services that are complementary to ours.
We rely on third parties to sell and distribute our products, and we rely on their information to manage our business.
We primarily sell our products to a network of distributors, retailers and e-tailers (together with our direct sales channel partners).
We are dependent on those direct sales channel partners to distribute and sell our products to indirect sales channel partners and ultimately to consumers.
The sales and business practices of all such sales channel partners, their compliance with laws and regulations, and their reputations - of which we may or may not be aware - may affect our business and our reputation.
While our overall distribution relationships are diffuse, over a quarter of our gross sales are concentrated with two customers - Amazon Inc. and Ingram Micro - and their affiliated entities.
If online sales grow as a percentage of overall sales, we expect that we will become even more reliant on Amazon.
For example, if sales at large retail stores are displaced as a result of bankruptcy, competition from Internet sales channels or otherwise, our product sales could be adversely affected.
Any loss of a major partner or distribution channel or other channel disruption could make us more dependent on alternate channels, increase pricing and promotional pressures from other partners and distribution channels, increase our marketing costs, or adversely impact buying and inventory patterns, payment terms or other contractual terms.
Our sales channel partners also sell products offered by our competitors and, in the case of retailer house brands, may also be our competitors.
If product competitors offer our sales channel partners more favorable terms, have more products available to meet their needs, or utilize the leverage of broader product lines sold through the channel, or if our sales channel partners show preference for their own house brands, our sales channel partners may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products.
In addition, certain of our sales channel partners could decide to de-emphasize the product categories that we offer in exchange for other product categories that they believe provide them with higher returns.
As we expand into new product categories and markets in pursuit of growth, we will have to build relationships with new channel partners and adapt to new distribution and marketing models.
These new partners, practices and models may require significant management attention and operational resources and may affect our accounting, including revenue recognition, gross margins, and the ability to make comparisons from period to period.
Entrenched and more experienced competitors will make these transitions difficult.
Certain product categories, such as Video Collaboration, may also require that we further build and scale our own enterprise sales force.
Several of our competitors already have large enterprise sale forces and experience and success with that sales model.
45

We reserve for cooperative marketing arrangements, incentive programs and pricing programs with our sales channel partners.
There could be significant differences between the actual costs of such arrangements and programs and our estimates.
We use sell-through data, which represents sales of our products by our direct retailer and e-tailer customers to consumers, and by our distributor customers to their customers, along with other metrics, to assess consumer demand for our products.
Sell-through data is subject to limitations due to collection methods and the third-party nature of the data and thus may not be an accurate indicator of actual consumer demand for our products.
In addition, we rely on channel inventory data from our sales channel partners.
Our principal manufacturing operations and third-party contract manufacturers are located in China and Southeast Asia, which exposes us to risks associated with doing business in that geographic area as well as potential tariffs, adverse tax consequences and pressure to move or diversify our manufacturing locations.
The majority of our other production is performed by third-party contract manufacturers, including original design manufacturers, in China and Malaysia.
Our manufacturing operations in China could be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation and enforcement of legal standards, strains on China’s available labor pool, changes in labor costs and other employment dynamics, high turnover among Chinese employees, infrastructure issues, import-export issues, currency transfer restrictions, natural disasters, conflicts or disagreements between China and Taiwan or China and the United States, labor unrest, and other trade customs and practices that are dissimilar to those in the United States and Europe.
Interpretation and enforcement of China’s laws and regulations continue to evolve and we expect differences in interpretation and enforcement to continue in the foreseeable future.
Our manufacturing operations at third-party contractors could be adversely affected by contractual disagreements, by labor unrest, by natural disasters, by strains on local communications, trade, and other infrastructures, by competition for the available labor pool or manufacturing capacity, by increasing labor and other costs, and by other trade customs and practices that are dissimilar to those in the United States and Europe.
Further, we may be exposed to fluctuations in the value of the local currency in the countries in which manufacturing occurs.
Future appreciation of these local currencies could increase our component and other raw material costs.
In addition, our labor costs could continue to rise as wage rates increase and the available labor pool declines.
These conditions could adversely affect our financial results.
If we do not successfully coordinate the worldwide manufacturing and distribution of our products, we could lose sales.
Our business requires us to coordinate the manufacture and distribution of our products over much of the world.
We rely on third parties to manufacture many of our products, manage centralized distribution centers, and transport our products.
We purchase certain products and key components from a limited number of sources.
From time to time, we have experienced component shortages and extended lead times on semiconductors, such as micro-controllers and optical sensors, and base metals used in our products.
As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC adopted disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer’s efforts to identify and prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals.
Additional reporting obligations are being considered by the European Union.
The implementation of the existing U.S. requirements and any additional requirements in Europe could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products.
The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited, and the implementation of these requirements may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals.
We filed our report for the calendar year 2017 with the SEC on May 31, 2018.
We conduct operations in a number of countries and have invested significantly in growing our sales and marketing activities in China, and the effect of business, legal and political risks associated with international operations could adversely affect us.
We conduct operations in a number of countries and have invested significantly in growing our personnel and sales and marketing activities in China and, to a lesser extent, other emerging markets.
We may also increase our investments to grow sales in other emerging markets, such as Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
There are risks inherent in doing business in international markets, including:



•Difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;



47

•Compliance with laws and regulations, including environmental, tax, import/export and anti-corruption laws, which vary from country to country and over time, increasing the costs of compliance and potential risks of non-compliance;



•Varying laws, regulations and other legal protections, uncertain and varying enforcement of those laws and regulations, dependence on local authorities, and the importance of local networks and relationships;



•Exposure to political and financial instability, especially with the uncertainty associated with the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in certain Euro zone countries and the stability of the European Union, which may lead to reduced sales, currency exchange losses and collection difficulties or other losses;



•Political and economic uncertainty around the world, including uncertainty resulting from the recent United States presidential and congressional elections, change of administration in the United States and the United Kingdom's referendum in June 2016, and other national elections and policy shifts;



•Import or export restrictions or licensing requirements that could affect some of our products, including those with encryption technology;



•Trade protection measures, custom duties, tariffs, import or export duties, and other trade barriers, restrictions and regulations;



•Lack of infrastructure or services necessary or appropriate to support our products and services;



•Exposure to fluctuations in the value of local currencies;



•Difficulties and increased costs in establishing sales and distribution channels in unfamiliar markets, with their own market characteristics and competition, including entrenched local competition;



•Weak protection of our intellectual property rights;



•Higher credit risks;



•Changes in VAT (value-added tax) or VAT reimbursement;



•Imposition of currency exchange controls;



•Delays from customs brokers or government agencies; and



•A broad range of customs, consumer trends, and more.
Sales growth in key markets, including China, is an important part of our expectations for our business.
The U.S. government has indicated and demonstrated its intent to alter its approach to international trade policy through the renegotiation, and potential termination, of certain existing bilateral or multilateral trade agreements and treaties with, and the imposition of tariffs on a wide range of products and other goods from, China, countries in EMEA and other countries.
As noted previously, we have invested significantly in manufacturing facilities in China and Southeast Asia.
Given our manufacturing in those countries, and our lack of manufacturing elsewhere, policy changes in the United States or other countries, such as the tariffs already proposed, implemented and threatened in 2018 and 2019, present particular risks for us.
There are also risks associated with retaliatory tariffs and resulting trade wars.
We cannot predict future trade policy, the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements or treaties, or tariffs and their impact on our business.
A trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy.
To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the United States or other countries increase the price of, or limit the amount of, our products or components or materials used in our products imported into the United States or other countries, or create adverse tax consequences, the cost or gross margin of our products may be adversely affected and the demand from our customers for products and services may be diminished.
Uncertainty surrounding international trade policy and disputes and protectionist measures could also have an adverse effect on consumer confidence and spending.
If we deem it necessary to alter all or a portion of our activities or operations in response to such policies, agreements or tariffs, our capital and operating costs may increase.
Our financial performance is subject to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
A significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.
Therefore, we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.
Our primary exposure to movements in currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S.
Dollar-denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide.
For the three months ended June 30, 2019, approximately 47% of our revenue was in non-U.S. denominated currencies.
The weakening of currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of our non-U.S.
Dollar-denominated sales and earnings.
Margins on sales of our products in non-U.S.
Dollar-denominated countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers in non-U.S.
Dollar-denominated countries could be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Dollar-denominated sales and earnings.
Conversely, strengthening of currency rates may also increase our product component costs and other expenses denominated in those currencies, adversely affecting operating results.
We further note that a larger portion of our sales than of our expenses are denominated in non-U.S. denominated currencies.
We use derivative instruments to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
The use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in currency exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and do not protect us from long term shifts in currency exchange rates.
Moreover, these exposures may change over time.
As a company operating in many markets and jurisdictions, expanding into new growth categories, and engaging in acquisitions, and as a Swiss, dual-listed company, we are subject to risks associated with new, existing and potential future laws and regulations.
Based on our current business model and as we expand into new markets and product categories and acquire companies, businesses and assets, we must comply with a wide variety of laws, standards and other requirements governing, among other things, health and safety, hazardous materials usage, product-related energy consumption, packaging, recycling and environmental matters.
Our products may be required to obtain regulatory approvals and satisfy other regulatory concerns in the various jurisdictions where they are manufactured, sold or both.
Companies, businesses and assets that we acquire may not be in compliance with regulations in all jurisdictions.
These requirements create procurement and design challenges, which, among other things, require us to incur additional costs identifying suppliers and contract manufacturers who can provide or obtain compliant materials, parts and end 



49

products.
As a Swiss company with shares listed on both the SIX Swiss Exchange and the Nasdaq Global Select Market, we are also subject to both Swiss and United States corporate governance and securities laws and regulations.
In addition to the extra costs and regulatory burdens of our dual regulatory obligations, the two regulatory regimes may not always be compatible and may impose disclosure obligations, operating restrictions or tax effects on our business to which our competitors and other companies are not subject.
For example, on January 1, 2014, subject to certain transitional provisions, the Swiss Federal Council Ordinance Against Excessive Compensation at Public Companies (the Ordinance) became effective in connection with the Minder initiative approved by Swiss voters during 2013.
The Ordinance, among other things, (a) requires a binding shareholder “say on pay” vote with respect to the compensation of members of our executive management and Board of Directors, (b) generally prohibits the making of severance, advance, transaction premiums and similar payments to members of our executive management and Board of Directors, (c) imposes other restrictive compensation practices, and (d) requires that our articles of incorporation specify various compensation-related matters.
In addition, during 2013, Swiss voters considered an initiative to limit pay for a chief executive officer to a multiple of no more than twelve times the salary of the lowest-paid employee.
Although voters rejected that initiative, it did receive substantial voter support.
The Ordinance, potential future initiatives relating to corporate governance or executive compensation, and Swiss voter sentiment in favor of such regulations may increase our non-operating costs and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and members of our Board of Directors.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP which are subject to interpretation or changes by the FASB, the SEC and other various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles.
We are incorporated in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland, and our effective income tax rate benefited from a longstanding ruling from the canton of Vaud through March 31, 2019.
On May 19, 2019, the voters in Switzerland approved TRAF, a major reform in response to certain guidance and demands from both the European Union and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.
TRAF mandates reforms in the cantonal tax law that are expected to take effect on January 1, 2020.
As of June 30, 2019, TRAF has not been enacted as the federal and cantonal legislative procedures are still in process.
While we will have a higher effective tax rate, we cannot be certain of the final outcome of the Swiss federal or cantonal tax reforms or their impact on our effective income tax rate and business, either in the short term or in the long term.
Our effective income tax rate in a given fiscal year reflects a variety of factors that may not be present in the succeeding fiscal year or years.
There is no assurance that our effective income tax rate will not change in future periods.
For example, policy changes in the United States or China 



50

predicated on our presence in those countries could adversely affect where we recognize profit and our effective income tax rate.
If our effective income tax rate increases in future periods, our net income and cash flows could be adversely affected.
We have been expanding the categories of products we sell, such as entering new markets and introducing products for tablets, other mobile devices, digital music, and video collaboration.
We expect to continue to enter new categories and markets.
Infringement claims against us may also increase as the functionality of video, voice, data and conferencing products begin to overlap.
Our future success depends in part on our proprietary technology, technical know-how and other intellectual property.
We hold various United States patents and pending applications, together with corresponding patents and pending applications from other countries.
Unauthorized parties have copied and may in the future attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards.
The products that we sell could contain defects in design or manufacture.
Defects could also occur in the products or components that are supplied to us.
There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and remedy all defects in the hardware and software we sell.
While we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase liability insurance, our reserves may not be adequate to cover such claims and liabilities and our insurance is subject to deductibles and may not be adequate to cover such claims and liabilities.
Furthermore, our contracts with distributors and retailers may contain warranty, indemnification and other provisions related to product quality issues, and claims under those provisions may adversely affect our business and operating results.

Significant disruptions in, or breaches in security of, our websites or information technology systems could adversely affect our business.
As a consumer electronics company, our websites are an important presentation of our company, identity and brands and an important means of interaction with and source of information for consumers of our products.
We also rely on our centralized information technology systems for product-related information and to store intellectual property, forecast our business, maintain financial records, manage operations and inventory, and operate other critical functions.
We allocate significant resources to maintain our information technology systems and deploy network security, data encryption, training and other measures to protect against unauthorized access or misuse.
Nevertheless, our websites and information technology systems are susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, structural or operational failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, other data security issues, telecommunication failures, user error, malfeasance, catastrophes, system or software upgrades, integration or migration, or other foreseeable and unforeseen events.
From time to time, we and our suppliers have identified vulnerabilities or other issues that we believe have been addressed, and we expect such issues to continue to arise.
Breaches or disruptions of our websites or information technology systems, breaches of confidential information, data corruption or other data security issues could adversely affect our brands, reputation, relationships with customers or business partners, or consumer or investor perception of our company, business or products or result in disruptions of our operations, loss of intellectual property or our customers’ or our business partners’ data, reduced value of our investments in our brands, design, research and development or engineering, or costs to address regulatory inquiries or actions or private litigation, to respond to customers or partners or to rebuild or restore our websites or information technology systems.
The collection, storage, transmission, use and distribution of user data could give rise to liabilities and additional costs of operation as a result of laws, governmental regulation and risks of security breaches.
In connection with certain of our products, we collect data related to our consumers.
This information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and especially in Europe.
For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is applicable to us and to all companies processing data of European Union residents, became effective in May 2018 and imposes significant fines and sanctions for violation of the Regulation.
Government actions are typically intended to protect the privacy and security of personal information and its collection, storage, transmission, use and distribution in or from the governing jurisdiction.
In addition, because various jurisdictions have different laws and regulations concerning the use, storage and transmission of such information, we may face requirements that pose compliance challenges in existing markets as well as new international markets that we seek to enter.
The collection of user data heightens the risk of security breaches and other data security issues related to our IT systems and the systems of third-party data storage and other service and IT providers.
Such laws and regulations, and the variation between jurisdictions, as well as additional security measures and risk, could subject us to costs, allocation of additional resources, liabilities or negative publicity that could adversely affect our business.
In previous periods, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and, if we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls or if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, our business and stock price could be adversely affected.
In connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we have identified in the past and may, from time-to-time in the future, identify issues with our internal controls and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting.
The most recent material weakness was identified during the preparation of our audited financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2017, and was related to the allowances and accruals for customer incentives, cooperative marketing and pricing programs.
In the past, we have identified other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2017, certain of which resulted in late filings of and an amendment to our periodic reports and in restatements of our financial results.
A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

We cannot ensure that our current share repurchase program will be fully utilized or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value.
We similarly cannot ensure that we will continue to increase our dividend payments or to pay dividends at all.
Share repurchases and dividends diminish our cash reserves.
In March 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a three-year $250.0 million repurchase program of our registered shares.
We have also paid cash dividends and increased the size of our dividend, each year since fiscal year 2013.
Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase all or any of the dollar value of shares authorized for repurchase.
Similarly, we are not obligated to pay dividends on our registered shares.
Under Swiss law, we may only pay dividends upon the approval of a majority of our shareholders, which is under the discretion of and generally follows a recommendation by our Board of Directors that such a dividend is in the best interests of our shareholders.
There can be no assurance that our Board of Directors will continue to recommend, or that our shareholders will approve, dividend increases or any dividend at all.
If we do not pay a regular dividend, we may lose the interest of investors that focus their investments on dividend-paying companies, which could create downward pressure on our share price.
Any announcement of termination or suspension of our share repurchase program or dividend may result in a decrease in our share price.
The share repurchase program and payment of cash dividends could also diminish our cash reserves that may be needed for investments in our business, acquisitions or other purposes.
Without dividends, the trading price of our shares must appreciate for investors to realize a gain on their investment.
Goodwill associated with a number of previous acquisitions could result in impairment charges.
The slowdown in the overall video conferencing industry together with the competitive environment in fiscal year 2013 resulted in a $214.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in fiscal year 2013, which substantially impacted results of discontinued operations.
We recorded an additional impairment charge of goodwill of $122.7 million related to our Lifesize video conferencing discontinued operations in fiscal year 2015, reducing its goodwill to zero, which substantially impacted results of discontinued operations again.
