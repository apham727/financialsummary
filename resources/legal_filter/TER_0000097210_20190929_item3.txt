 Item 3:  



Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks   



For “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” affecting Teradyne, see Part 2 Item 7a, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks,” in our Annual Report on Form 



10-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019.
There were no material changes in our exposure to market risk from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 



10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
In December 2016, Teradyne issued $460 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior unsecured notes (the “Notes”) due December 15, 2023.
As of September 29, 2019, the Notes had a fair value of $867.4 million.
The table below provides a sensitivity analysis of hypothetical 10% changes of Teradyne’s stock price as of the end of the third quarter of 2019 and the estimated impact on the fair value of the Notes.
The fair value of the Notes is subject to equity price risk due to the convertible feature.
The change in stock price affects the fair value of the convertible senior notes, but does not impact Teradyne’s financial position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation.
Additionally, we carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only.
In connection with the offering of the Notes we also sold warrants to the option counterparties.
These transactions have been accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders’ equity.
The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the Notes.
