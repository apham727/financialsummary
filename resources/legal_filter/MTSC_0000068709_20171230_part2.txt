Risk Factors



A discussion of our risk factors can be found in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
The risks described below and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was signed into law on December 22, 2017.
The tax benefit recorded for the three months ended December 30, 2017 involves significant judgment and assumptions as to the impact of the Tax Act.
Our estimated impact of the new law is based on management's current knowledge and assumptions.
We expect to record any adjustments in the next year in accordance with the guidance provided in the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118, and these adjustments could be material.
