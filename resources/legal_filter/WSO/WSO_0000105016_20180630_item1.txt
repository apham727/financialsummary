Basis of Consolidation  
The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this report include the accounts of Watsco, all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of three joint ventures with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), in each of which Watsco maintains a controlling interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition  
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued a standard on revenue recognition that provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. The standard is principle-based and provides a five-step model to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. In 2015 and 2016, the FASB issued several updates to this standard. The adoption of this standard and its related amendments (collectively, the New Revenue Standard) on January 1, 2018 did not result in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings under the modified retrospective approach, nor did it have a significant impact on our consolidated net income, balance sheet or cash flow. See Note 2.

Stock Compensation  
In May 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. This guidance must be applied prospectively and became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
Derivatives and Hedging  
In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for hedging derivatives. This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We elected to adopt this guidance during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
IntangiblesGoodwill and Other  
In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this updated standard, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. An entity also should consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if any. This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Sales Incentives  
We estimate sales incentives expected to be paid over the term of the program based on the most likely amount. Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction in the transaction price and are generally paid on an annual basis. Accrued sales incentives of $11,600 and $13,001 as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheets.

We maintain an unsecured, syndicated revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases and issuances of letters of credit. Effective February 5, 2018, we decreased the borrowing capacity under this credit agreement from $600,000 to $300,000. Included in the credit facility are a $90,000 swingline subfacility, a $10,000 letter of credit subfacility and a $75,000 multicurrency borrowing sublimit. The credit agreement matures on July 1, 2019.

At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $141,600 and $21,800, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants with respect to consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, and other customary restrictions. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2018.  
At June 30, 2018, $1,510 of short-term borrowings were outstanding under a credit line established by our Mexican subsidiary. This line of credit has a one-year term, maturing on June 12, 2019, is non-committed and provides for borrowings of up to approximately $3,800 (MXN 75,000) for general corporate purposes. No short-term borrowings were outstanding under this credit line at December 31, 2017.  
On February 13, 2017, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise Northeast LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise II, for cash consideration of $42,688, which increased our controlling interest from 70% to 80%. Carrier Enterprise II was formed in 2011 as a joint venture with Carrier. Carrier Enterprise II had sales of approximately $545,000 in 2017 from 40 locations in the northeastern United States and 14 locations in Mexico.  
On June 21, 2017, our first joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise, LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, acquired an approximately 35% ownership interest in Russell Sigler, Inc. (RSI), an HVAC distributor with 2017 sales of approximately $680,000, operating from 30 locations in the Western U.S. We have an 80% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise I, and Carrier has a 20% non-controlling interest. Carrier Enterprise I acquired its ownership interest in RSI for cash consideration of $63,600, of which we contributed $50,880 and Carrier contributed $12,720. Effective June 29, 2018, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an additional 1.4% voting equity interest in RSI, which increased Carrier Enterprise Is ownership interest in RSI from approximately 35% to 36.3%. Total cash consideration of $3,760 was paid on July 5, 2018, of which we contributed $3,008 and Carrier contributed $752. Carrier Enterprise I entered into a shareholders agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) with RSI and its shareholders. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, RSIs shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on either book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price paid for its investment in RSI. RSIs shareholders may transfer their respective shares of RSI common stock only to members of the Sigler family or to Carrier Enterprise I, and, at any time from and after the date on which Carrier Enterprise I owns 85% or more of RSIs outstanding common stock, it has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from RSIs shareholders the remaining outstanding shares of RSI common stock. Additionally, Carrier Enterprise I has the right to appoint two of RSIs six board members. Given Carrier Enterprise Is 36.3% voting equity interest in RSI and its right to appoint two out of RSIs six board members, this investment in RSI is accounted for under the equity method.  
We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the earnings impact that foreign exchange rate fluctuations would otherwise have on certain monetary liabilities that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies.  
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement of these derivatives results in reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings for the period in which the settlement of these instruments occurs. The maximum period for which we hedge our cash flow using these instruments is 12 months. Accordingly, at June 30, 2018, all of our open foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of one year or less. The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at June 30, 2018 was $31,700, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through March 2019.  
At June 30, 2018, we expected an estimated $941 pre-tax gain to be reclassified into earnings to reflect the fixed prices obtained from foreign exchange hedging within the next 12 months.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments  
Equity securities  the investments are exchange-traded equity securities. Fair values for these investments are based on closing stock prices from active markets and are therefore classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  
Derivative financial instruments  these derivatives are foreign currency forward and option contracts. See Note 8. Fair value is based on observable market inputs, such as forward rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivatives within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
