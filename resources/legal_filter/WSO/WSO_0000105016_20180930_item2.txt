Company Overview  
Joint Ventures with Carrier Corporation  
In 2011, we formed a second joint venture with Carrier and completed two additional transactions. In April 2011, Carrier contributed 28 of its company-owned locations in the Northeast U.S., and we contributed 14 locations in the Northeast U.S. In July 2011, we purchased Carriers distribution operations in Mexico, which included seven locations. Collectively, the Northeast locations and the Mexico operations are referred to as Carrier Enterprise II. On November 29, 2016, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and, on February 13, 2017, we again purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II, which together increased our controlling interest to 80%.  
In 2012, we formed a third joint venture, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise III, with UTC Canada Corporation, referred to as UTC Canada, an affiliate of Carrier. Carrier contributed 35 of its company-owned locations in Canada to Carrier Enterprise III. We have a 60% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise III, and UTC Canada has a 40% non-controlling interest.

Third Quarter of 2018 Compared to Third Quarter of 2017  
Revenues  
Revenues for the third quarter of 2018 increased $66.4 million, or 5%, including $3.4 million from locations opened and acquired during the preceding 12 months, offset by $3.8 million from locations closed. On a same-store basis, revenues increased $66.8 million, or 5%, as compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting a 7% increase in sales of HVAC equipment (68% of sales), which included a 6% increase in residential HVAC equipment and a 9% increase in commercial HVAC equipment, a 4% increase in sales of other HVAC products (28% of sales) and flat sales of commercial refrigeration products (4% of sales). The increase in same-store revenues was primarily due to realization of price increases, demand for the replacement of residential and commercial HVAC equipment and a higher mix of high-efficiency air conditioning and heating systems, which sell at higher unit prices.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  
Interest Expense, Net  
Net interest expense for the third quarter of 2018 decreased $1.1 million, or 51%, primarily as a result of a decrease in average outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a higher effective interest rate for the 2018 period, in each case under our revolving credit facility, as compared to the same period in 2017.  
Net Income Attributable to Watsco, Inc.  
Net income attributable to Watsco for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 increased $14.1 million, or 22%, compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenues, expanded profit margins, lower interest expense, net, and lower income taxes, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues, as discussed above.  
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017  
Revenues  
Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $177.7 million, or 5%, including $14.0 million from locations opened and acquired during the preceding 12 months, offset by $10.3 million from locations closed. On a same-store basis, revenues increased $174.0 million, or 5%, as compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting a 7% increase in sales of HVAC equipment (68% of sales), which included a 7% increase in residential HVAC equipment and a 6% increase in commercial HVAC equipment, a 5% increase in sales of other HVAC products (28% of sales) and flat sales of commercial refrigeration products (4% of sales). The increase in same-store revenues was primarily due to realization of price increases and demand for the replacement of residential and commercial HVAC equipment. Revenues from sales of residential HVAC equipment also benefited from an improved sales mix of higher-efficiency air conditioning and heating systems, which sell at higher unit prices.  
Gross Profit  
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $31.0 million, or 6%, primarily due to increased revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased to 15.9% versus 15.8% for the same period in 2017. On a same-store basis, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to our inability to leverage fixed operating costs to the same extent as in 2017.

Other income of $8.5 million and $2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, represents our share of the net income of RSI.  
Interest Expense, Net  
Net interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased $2.6 million, or 53%, primarily as a result of a decrease in average outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a higher effective interest rate for the 2018 period, in each case under our revolving credit facility, as compared to the same period in 2017.  
Net Income Attributable to Watsco, Inc.  
Net income attributable to Watsco for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $38.4 million, or 23%, compared to the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenues and other income, expanded profit margins, lower interest expense, net, and lower income taxes as discussed above.

Table of Contents 
Working Capital  
Working capital increased to $993.0 million at September 30, 2018 from $920.9 million at December 31, 2017, reflecting higher levels of accounts receivable and inventories, primarily due to the seasonality of our business.  
Cash Flows  
The individual items contributing to cash flow changes for the periods presented are detailed in the condensed consolidated unaudited statements of cash flows contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
Operating Activities  
Investing Activities  
Net cash used in investing activities was lower due to the purchase of an ownership interest in RSI for $63.6 million in 2017, partially offset by an acquisition for cash consideration of $5.9 million and the purchase of an additional ownership interest in RSI for $3.8 million in 2018.  
Financing Activities  
The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds borrowed under our revolving credit agreement in the 2018 period and the purchase of an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise II for $42.7 million in 2017, partially offset by an increase in dividends paid in 2018.  
Revolving Credit Agreement  
We maintain an unsecured, syndicated revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases, and issuances of letters of credit. Effective February 5, 2018, we decreased the borrowing capacity under this revolving credit agreement from $600.0 million to $300.0 million. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $116.4 million and $21.8 million were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement, respectively. The credit agreement matures on July 1, 2019 and accordingly, borrowings outstanding are classified as current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet at September 30, 2018. We believe that we will refinance the credit agreement at or prior to its maturity on similar terms and subject to similar conditions.  
The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants with respect to consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, and other customary restrictions. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2018.

Investment in Unconsolidated Entity  
On June 21, 2017, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an approximately 35% ownership interest in RSI, an HVAC distributor operating from 30 locations in the Western U.S. for cash consideration of $63.6 million, of which we contributed $50.9 million, and Carrier contributed $12.7 million. Effective June 29, 2018, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an additional 1.4% ownership interest in RSI, which increased Carrier Enterprise Is ownership interest in RSI to 36.3%. Total cash consideration of $3.8 million was paid on July 5, 2018, of which we contributed $3.0 million and Carrier contributed $0.8 million. Carrier Enterprise I is a party to a shareholders agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) with RSI and its shareholders. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, RSIs shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on either book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price paid for its investment in RSI. RSIs shareholders may transfer their respective shares of RSI common stock only to members of the Sigler family or to Carrier Enterprise I, and, at any time from and after the date on which Carrier Enterprise I owns 85% or more of RSIs outstanding common stock, it has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from RSIs shareholders the remaining outstanding shares of RSI common stock. We believe that our operating cash flows, cash on hand, and funds available for borrowing under our revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to purchase any additional ownership interests in RSI.  
On August 23, 2018, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired Alert Labs Inc., a technology company based in Ontario, Canada for cash consideration of $5.9 million and the issuance of 47,103 shares of Common stock, having a fair value of $8.2 million.  
At-the-Market Offering Program  
During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2017, we sold 35,000 shares of Common stock under the ATM Program for net proceeds of $5.4 million. Direct costs of $0.3 million incurred in connection with the offering were charged against the proceeds from the sale of Common stock and reflected as a reduction of paid-in capital. At September 30, 2017, $244.6 million remained available for sale under the Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, we had completed the offering of shares under the ATM Program. The net proceeds were primarily used to repay outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes.  
Company Share Repurchase Program  
In September 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, at managements discretion, of up to 7,500,000 shares of common stock in the open market or via private transactions. Shares repurchased under the program are accounted for using the cost method and result in a reduction of shareholders equity. No shares were repurchased during the quarters ended September 30, 2018 or 2017. In aggregate, 6,370,913 shares of Common and Class B common stock have been repurchased at a cost of $114.4 million since the inception of the program. At September 30, 2018, there were 1,129,087 shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the program.
