Basis of Consolidation  
The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this report include the accounts of Watsco, all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of three joint ventures with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), in each of which Watsco maintains a controlling interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Derivatives and Hedging  
In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for hedging derivatives. This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We elected to adopt this guidance during the quarter ended June 30, 2018, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
Leases  
In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The guidance requires the use of a modified retrospective approach to apply the standard at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements. In July 2018, updated guidance was issued which provides an additional transition method of adoption that allows entities to initially apply the standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We will adopt the guidance on January 1, 2019 using this additional transition method and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.  
IntangiblesGoodwill and Other  
In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this updated standard, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. An entity also should consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if any. This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

We maintain an unsecured, syndicated revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases and issuances of letters of credit. Effective February 5, 2018, we decreased the borrowing capacity under this revolving credit agreement from $600,000 to $300,000. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $116,400 and $21,800, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. The credit agreement matures on July 1, 2019 and, accordingly,

 borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement are classified as current liabilities in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet at September 30, 2018. We believe that we will refinance the credit agreement at or prior to its maturity on similar terms and subject to similar conditions.  
The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants with respect to consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, and other customary restrictions. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2018.  
On February 13, 2017, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise Northeast LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise II, for cash consideration of $42,688, which increased our controlling interest from 70% to 80%. Carrier Enterprise II was formed in 2011 as a joint venture with Carrier. Carrier Enterprise II had sales of approximately $545,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 40 locations in the northeastern United States and 14 locations in Mexico.  
On June 21, 2017, our first joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise, LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, acquired an approximately 35% ownership interest in Russell Sigler, Inc. (RSI), an HVAC distributor with 2017 sales of approximately $680,000, operating from 30 locations in the Western U.S. We have an 80% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise I, and Carrier has a 20% non-controlling interest. Carrier Enterprise I acquired its ownership interest in RSI for cash consideration of $63,600, of which we contributed $50,880, and Carrier contributed $12,720. Effective June 29, 2018, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an additional 1.4% ownership interest in RSI, which increased Carrier Enterprise Is ownership interest in RSI to 36.3%. Total cash consideration of $3,760 was paid on July 5, 2018, of which we contributed $3,008 and Carrier contributed $752. Carrier Enterprise I is a party to a shareholders agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) with RSI and its shareholders. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, RSIs shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on either book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price paid for its investment in RSI. RSIs shareholders may transfer their respective shares of RSI common stock only to members of the Sigler family or to Carrier Enterprise I, and, at any time from and after the date on which Carrier Enterprise I owns 85% or more of RSIs outstanding common stock, it has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from RSIs shareholders the remaining outstanding shares of RSI common stock. Additionally, Carrier Enterprise I has the right to appoint two of RSIs six board members. Given Carrier Enterprise Is 36.3% ownership interest in RSI and its right to appoint two out of RSIs six board members, this investment in RSI is accounted for under the equity method.  
We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the earnings impact that foreign exchange rate fluctuations would otherwise have on certain monetary liabilities that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies.  
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement of these derivatives results in reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings for the period in which the settlement of these instruments occurs. The maximum period for which we hedge our cash flow using these instruments is 12 months. Accordingly, at September 30, 2018, all of our open foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of one year or less. The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at September 30, 2018 was $36,800, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through June 2019.

At September 30, 2018, we expected an estimated $3 pre-tax gain to be reclassified into earnings to reflect the fixed prices obtained from foreign exchange hedging within the next 12 months.  
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments  
We recognized losses of $(108), $(502), $(299) and $(912) from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Equity securities  the investments are exchange-traded equity securities. Fair values for these investments are based on closing stock prices from active markets and are therefore classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  
Derivative financial instruments  these derivatives are foreign currency forward and option contracts. See Note 9. Fair value is based on observable market inputs, such as forward rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivatives within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  
There were no transfers in or out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.  
During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2017, we sold 35,000 shares of Common stock under the ATM Program for net proceeds of $5,391. Direct costs of $285 incurred in connection with the offering were charged against the proceeds from the sale of Common stock and reflected as a reduction of paid-in capital. At September 30, 2017, $244,560 remained available for sale under the Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, we had completed the offering of shares under the ATM Program. The net proceeds were primarily used to repay outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes.  
We paid cash dividends of $1.45, $1.25, $4.15 and $3.35 per share of both Common stock and Class B common stock during the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
Non-Vested Restricted Stock  
Exercise of Stock Options  
During the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, 8,600, 9,084, 53,184 and 25,084 stock options, respectively, were exercised for Common stock. Cash received from common stock issued as a result of stock options exercised during the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, was $856, $801, $4,837 and $2,111, respectively.  
Employee Stock Purchase Plan  
During the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, 2,235, 2,718, 6,716 and 6,977 shares of Common stock, respectively, were issued under our employee stock purchase plan for which we received net proceeds of $382, $402, $1,142 and $1,004, respectively.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we issued 17,318 and 16,389 shares of Common stock, respectively, to our profit sharing retirement plan, representing the Common stock discretionary matching contributions of $2,945 and $2,428, respectively.  
Non-controlling Interest  
Litigation, Claims and Assessments  
Purchases from Carrier and its affiliates comprised 64%, 62%, 63% and 62% of all inventory purchases made during the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, approximately $93,000 and $75,000, respectively, was payable to Carrier and its affiliates, net of receivables. Our joint ventures with Carrier also sell HVAC products to Carrier and its affiliates. Revenues in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 included approximately $28,000, $19,000, $65,000 and $51,000, respectively, of sales to Carrier and its affiliates. We believe these transactions are conducted on terms equivalent to an arms-length basis in the ordinary course of business.
