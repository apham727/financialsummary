Joint Ventures with Carrier Corporation  
In 2009, we formed a joint venture with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, in which Carrier contributed 95 of its company-owned locations in 13 Sun Belt states and Puerto Rico, and its export division in Miami, Florida, and we contributed 15 locations that distributed Carrier products. We have an 80% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise I, and Carrier has a 20% non-controlling interest.  
In 2011, we formed a second joint venture with Carrier and completed two additional transactions. In April 2011, Carrier contributed 28 of its company-owned locations in the Northeast U.S., and we contributed 14 locations in the Northeast U.S. In July 2011, we purchased Carriers distribution operations in Mexico, which included seven locations. Collectively, the Northeast locations and the Mexico operations are referred to as Carrier Enterprise II. We have an 80% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise II, and Carrier has a 20% non-controlling interest.  
In 2012, we formed a third joint venture, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise III, with UTC Canada Corporation, referred to as UTC Canada, an affiliate of Carrier. Carrier contributed 35 of its company-owned locations in Canada to Carrier Enterprise III. We have a 60% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise III, and UTC Canada has a 40% non-controlling interest.

In the following narratives, computations and other information referring to same-store basis exclude the effects of locations closed, acquired, or locations opened, unless they are within close geographical proximity to existing locations, during the immediately preceding 12 months. At March 31, 2019 and 2018, 9 and 5 locations opened, respectively, were near existing locations and were therefore included in same-store basis information.  
Revenues  
Gross Profit  
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  
Other income of $1.4 million and $1.6 million for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, represents our share of the net income of RSI.  
Interest Expense, Net  
Interest expense, net, for the first quarter of 2019 increased $0.2 million, or 37%, primarily as a result of an increase in average outstanding borrowings, partially offset by a lower effective interest rate for the 2019 period, in each case under our revolving credit facility, as compared to the same period in 2018.

Sources and Uses of Cash  
Working Capital  
Working capital decreased to $1,020.6 million at March 31, 2019 from $1,084.2 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease is primarily related to the current portion of lease liabilities recognized as current liabilities as a result of the adoption of the New Lease Standard on January 1, 2019.

Cash Flows  
The individual items contributing to cash flow changes for the periods presented are detailed in the condensed consolidated unaudited statements of cash flows contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
Operating Activities  
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the comparative timing of payments for accrued expenses and other current liabilities in 2019 versus 2018.  
Investing Activities  
Net cash used in investing activities was higher due to an increase in capital expenditures in 2019.  
Financing Activities  
The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to lower borrowing requirements and an increase in dividends paid in 2019.  
Revolving Credit Agreement  
We maintain an unsecured, $500.0 million syndicated multicurrency revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases and issuances of letters of credit. The credit facility has a seasonal component from October 1 to March 31, during which the borrowing capacity may be reduced to $400.0 million at our discretion (which would effectively reduce fees payable in respect of the unused portion of the commitment). Included in the credit facility are a $100.0 million swingline subfacility, a $10.0 million letter of credit subfacility, a $75.0 million alternative currency borrowing sublimit and an $8.0 million Mexican borrowing sublimit. The credit agreement matures on December 5, 2023.  
At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, $137.5 million and $135.2 million, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants with respect to consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, and other customary restrictions. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2019.  
Additionally, at March 31, 2019, $2.3 million of short-term borrowings were outstanding under a credit line established by our Mexican subsidiary. This line of credit has a one-year term, maturing on June 12, 2019, is non-committed and provides for borrowings of up to approximately $3.9 million (MXN 75.0 million) for general corporate purposes. No short-term borrowings were outstanding under this credit line at December 31, 2018.  
Investment in Unconsolidated Entity  
On June 21, 2017, Carrier Enterprise I acquired a 34.9% ownership interest in RSI, an HVAC distributor operating from 30 locations in the Western U.S. for cash consideration of $63.6 million, of which we contributed $50.9 million, and Carrier contributed $12.7 million. Effective June 29, 2018, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an additional 1.4% ownership interest in RSI, which increased Carrier Enterprise Is ownership interest in RSI to 36.3%. Total cash consideration of $3.8 million was paid on July 5, 2018, of which we contributed $3.0 million and Carrier contributed $0.8 million. Effective April 22, 2019, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an additional 1.8% ownership interest in RSI, which increased Carrier Enterprise Is ownership interest in RSI to 38.1% for cash consideration of $4.9 million, of which we contributed $3.9 million and Carrier contributed $1.0 million.
