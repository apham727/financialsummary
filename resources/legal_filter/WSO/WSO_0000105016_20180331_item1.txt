Basis of Consolidation  
The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this report include the accounts of Watsco, all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of three joint ventures with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), in each of which Watsco maintains a controlling interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
Use of Estimates  
Revenue Recognition  
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued a standard on revenue recognition that provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. The standard is principle-based and provides a five-step model to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. In 2015 and 2016, the FASB issued several updates to this standard. The adoption of this standard and its related amendments (collectively, the New Revenue Standard) on January 1, 2018 did not result in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings under the modified retrospective approach, nor did it have a significant impact on our consolidated net income, balance sheet or cash flow. See Note 2.  
Financial Instruments  
Stock Compensation  
In May 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. This guidance must be applied prospectively and became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This guidance will be applied using a modified retrospective approach and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2019. While we are still evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements, including the option to elect certain practical expedients, we expect that, upon adoption, the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recorded could be material to our consolidated balance sheets. However, we do not expect a material impact on our consolidated statements of income.  
IntangiblesGoodwill and Other  
In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this updated standard, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. An entity also should consider income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if any. This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
Derivatives and Hedging  
In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for hedging derivatives. This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Disaggregation of Revenues  
Diluted earnings per share excluded 9,228 and 16,067 shares for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to stock options with an exercise price per share greater than the average market value, resulting in an anti-dilutive effect on diluted earnings per share.  
We maintain an unsecured, syndicated revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases and issuances of letters of credit. Effective February 5, 2018, we decreased the borrowing capacity under this credit agreement from $600,000 to $300,000. Included in the credit facility are a $90,000 swingline subfacility, a $10,000 letter of credit subfacility and a $75,000 multicurrency borrowing sublimit. The credit agreement matures on July 1, 2019.  
At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $91,000 and $21,800, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement. The revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants with respect to consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, and other customary restrictions. We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2018.  
On February 13, 2017, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise Northeast LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise II, for cash consideration of $42,688, which increased our controlling interest from 70% to 80%. Carrier Enterprise II was formed in 2011 as a joint venture with Carrier. Carrier Enterprise II had sales of approximately $545,000 in 2017 from 40 locations in the northeastern United States and 14 locations in Mexico.  
We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the earnings impact that foreign exchange rate fluctuations would otherwise have on certain monetary liabilities that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies.  
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement of these derivatives results in reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings for the period in which the settlement of these instruments occurs. The maximum period for which we hedge our cash flow using these instruments is 12 months. Accordingly, at March 31, 2018, all of our open foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of one year or less. The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at March 31, 2018 was $34,200, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through December 2018.  
At March 31, 2018, we expected an estimated $276 pre-tax gain to be reclassified into earnings to reflect the fixed prices obtained from foreign exchange hedging within the next 12 months.  
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments  
Available-for-sale securities  the investments are exchange-traded equity securities. Fair values for these investments are based on closing stock prices from active markets and are therefore classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  
Derivative financial instruments  these derivatives are foreign currency forward and option contracts. See Note 7. Fair value is based on observable market inputs, such as forward rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivatives within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  
There were no transfers in or out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.  
We paid cash dividends of $1.25 and $1.05 per share of Common stock and Class B common stock during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
Non-Vested Restricted Stock  
During the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, we granted 91,609 and 100,399 shares of non-vested restricted stock, respectively.  
Exercise of Stock Options  
Employee Stock Purchase Plan  
During the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, 2,047 and 1,953 shares of Common stock were issued under our employee stock purchase plan for which we received net proceeds of $346 and $285, respectively.  
During the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, we issued 17,318 and 16,389 shares of Common stock, respectively, to our profit sharing retirement plan, representing the Common stock discretionary matching contribution of $2,945 and $2,428, respectively.  
Non-controlling Interest  
Litigation, Claims and Assessments  
Purchases from Carrier and its affiliates comprised 62% of all inventory purchases made during both the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, approximately $99,000 and $75,000, respectively, was payable to Carrier and its affiliates, net of receivables. Our joint ventures with Carrier also sell HVAC products to Carrier and its affiliates. Revenues in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 included approximately $16,000 and $11,000, respectively, of sales to Carrier and its affiliates. We believe these transactions are conducted on terms equivalent to an arms-length basis in the ordinary course of business.  
A member of our Board of Directors is the Senior Chairman of Greenberg Traurig, P.A., which serves as our principal outside counsel for compliance and acquisition-related legal services. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we paid this firm $4 for services performed, and $0 was payable at March 31, 2018.
