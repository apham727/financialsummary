1.Basis of Presentation



The fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the “Company,” “Cisco,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in July.
Fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 are each 52-week fiscal years.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries.
All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis in the following three geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).
We have prepared the accompanying financial data as of October 27, 2018 and for the three months ended October 27, 2018 and October 28, 2017, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
The July 28, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
However, we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 28, 2018.
The noncontrolling interests attributed to these investments, if any, are presented as a separate component from our equity in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The share of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests are not presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented.
Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts in prior periods in order to conform to the current period’s presentation.
We have evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued.
2.Recent Accounting Pronouncements



(a)New Accounting Updates Recently Adopted



Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition.
ASC 606 supersedes nearly all U.S. GAAP on revenue recognition and eliminated industry-specific guidance.
The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services at an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
ASC 606 allows two methods of adoption: i) retrospectively to each prior period presented (“full retrospective method”), or ii) retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized in retained earnings as of the date of adoption ("modified retrospective method").
At the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method to those contracts that were not completed as of July 28, 2018.
Refer to Opening Balance Adjustments below for the impact of adoption on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We have implemented new accounting policies, systems, processes, and internal controls necessary to support the requirements of ASC 606.
ASC 606 primarily impacts our revenue recognition for software arrangements and sales to two-tier distributors.
In both areas, the new standard accelerates the recognition of revenue.

The table below details the timing of when revenue was typically recognized under the prior revenue standard compared to the timing of when revenue is typically recognized under ASC 606 for these major areas:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



In addition to the above revenue recognition timing impacts, ASC 606 requires incremental contract acquisition costs (such as sales commissions) for customer contracts to be capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the assets relates.
As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations.
Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance.
We refer to our term software licenses, security software licenses, SaaS, and associated service arrangements as subscription offers.
Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once delivery and risk of loss has transferred to the customer.
Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term.
Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided.
SaaS arrangements have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services.
SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination.
In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.
Variable consideration includes various rebate, cooperative marketing, and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, partners and customers.
We assess certain software licenses, such as for security software, that contain critical updates or upgrades which customers can download throughout the contract term.
These updates or upgrades provide the customer the full functionality of the purchased security software licenses and are required to maintain the security license's utility as the risks and threats in the environment are rapidly

changing.
In these circumstances, the revenue from these software arrangements is recognized as a distinct performance obligation satisfied over the contract term.
For the additional disclosures required as part of ASC 606 see Note 3.
Financial Instruments In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that changes the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.
The most significant impact of this accounting standard update is that it requires the remeasurement of investments not accounted for under the equity method to be recorded at fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Operations at the end of each reporting period.
The application of this accounting standard update increases the variability of other income (loss), net.
Our equity investments are accounted for as follows:



•Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair value (RDFV) that are measured and recorded at fair value.
•Non-marketable equity securities do not have RDFV and are measured using a measurement alternative recorded at cost less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes.
For certain of these securities, we have elected to apply the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient.
The NAV is the estimated fair value of these investments.
These investments are measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss.
We adopted this accounting standard update beginning the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The standard was adopted using the modified retrospective method for our marketable equity securities and non-marketable equity securities measured using the NAV practical expedient.
For our non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, we applied the prospective method.
Refer to Opening Balance Adjustments below for the impact of adoption on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Income Taxes on Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets In October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires recognition of the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets (other than inventory) at the transaction date.
We adopted this accounting standard update beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a modified retrospective basis.
The ongoing impact of this standard will be facts and circumstances dependent on any transactions within its scope.
Refer to Opening Balance Adjustments below for the impact of adoption on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Classification of Cash Flow Elements In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows.
We adopted this accounting standard update beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a retrospective basis.
The application of this accounting standard update did not have an impact on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Restricted Cash in Statement of Cash Flows In November 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that provides guidance on the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows.
We adopted this accounting standard update beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.
The application of this accounting standard update did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Prior period information has been retrospectively adjusted due to the adoption of ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows, Restricted Cash in the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment  In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that removes Step



2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires the assessment of fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairments.
Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value.
We early adopted this accounting standard update beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a prospective basis.
Definition of a Business In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that clarifies the definition of a business to help companies evaluate whether acquisition or disposal transactions should be accounted for as asset groups or as businesses.
We adopted this accounting standard update beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a prospective basis.

Impact of ASC 606 Adoption



The application of ASC 606 increased our total revenue by $276 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
For additional information regarding ASC 606, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In connection with the adoption of ASC 606, we recorded a transition adjustment to increase retained earnings by $2.3 billion.
See above for the transition impact of ASC 606 by balance sheet line item.
In connection with the adoption of ASC 606, we established contract assets for unbilled receivables.
As of October 27, 2018, we had total capitalized contract acquisition costs of $673 million, of which $380 million was recorded in other current assets and $293 million was recorded in other assets.
The adoption of ASC 606 did not have any impact on net cash provided by operating activities.
(b)Recent Accounting Standards or Updates Not Yet Effective



Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update and subsequent amendments related to leases requiring lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities on the balance sheet, as well as corresponding right-of-use assets.
The new lease standard also makes some changes to lessor accounting and aligns key aspects of the lessor accounting model with the revenue recognition standard.
In addition, disclosures will be required to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
The accounting standard update will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and early adoption is permitted.
We expect to adopt this accounting standard update on a modified retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The accounting standard update will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and early adoption in fiscal 2020 is permitted.
We expect to adopt this accounting standard update on a modified retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and we are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following table presents this disaggregation of revenue (in millions):

Security primarily includes our unified threat management, advanced threat security, and web security products.
These products consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS.
Updates and upgrades for the term software licenses are critical for our software to perform its intended commercial purpose because of the continuous need for our software to secure our customers' network environments against frequent threats.
Therefore, security software licenses are generally represented by a single distinct performance obligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.
SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.
Other Products primarily include our Service Provider Video Software Solutions, cloud and system management products.
On May 1, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell the SPVSS business.
The sale was closed on October 28, 2018.
These products include both hardware and software licenses.
Our offerings in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control.
In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers, including technical support services and advanced services.
Technical support services represent the majority of these offerings which are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.
Advanced services are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized as services are delivered.

The sales arrangements as discussed above are typically made pursuant to customer purchase orders based on master purchase or partner agreements.
Cash is received based on our standard payment terms which is typically 30 days.
We provide financing arrangements to customers for all of our hardware, software and service offerings.
Refer to Note 8 for additional information.
For these arrangements, cash is typically received over time.
(b)Contract Balances



Accounts receivable, net was $4.5 billion as of October 27, 2018 compared to $5.6 billion as of July 28, 2018, as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Contract assets consist of unbilled receivables and are recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of scheduled billings to our customers.
These amounts are primarily related to software and service arrangements where transfer of control has occurred but we have not yet invoiced.
As of October 27, 2018 and July 29, 2018, our contract assets for these unbilled receivables were $447 million and $122 million, respectively, and were included in other current assets and other assets.
Deferred revenue was $16.8 billion as of October 27, 2018 compared to $19.7 billion as of July 28, 2018.
In connection with the adoption of ASC 606, we recorded an adjustment to retained earnings to reduce deferred revenue by $2.8 billion.
We recognized approximately $3.4 billion of revenue during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at July 29, 2018.
(c)Remaining Performance Obligations



Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) are comprised of deferred revenue plus unbilled contract revenue.
As of October 27, 2018, the aggregate amount of RPO was $22.3 billion, comprised of $16.8 billion of deferred revenue and $5.5 billion of unbilled contract revenue.
We expect approximately 55% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next year.
(d)Capitalized Contract Acquisition Costs



In connection with the adoption of ASC 606, we began to capitalize direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire contracts, primarily sales commissions, for which the associated revenue is expected to be recognized in future periods.
We incur these costs in connection with both initial contracts and renewals.
These costs are initially deferred and typically amortized over the term of the customer contract which corresponds to the period of benefit.
Deferred sales commissions were $673 million and $644 million as of October 27, 2018 and July 29, 2018, respectively, and were included in other current assets and other assets.
4.Acquisitions and Divestitures 



We completed two acquisitions during the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
A summary of the allocation of the total purchase consideration is presented as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



On September 28, 2018, we completed our acquisition of privately held Duo Security, Inc. ("Duo"), a leading provider of unified access security and multi-factor authentication delivered through the cloud.
Revenue from the Duo acquisition has been included in our Security product category.
The total purchase consideration related to acquisitions completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 consisted of cash consideration and vested share-based awards assumed.
The total cash and cash equivalents acquired from these acquisitions was approximately $82 million.
Total transaction costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities were $10 million and $9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
We recognized a gain of $3 million and $46 million during the first quarter of 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively, in connection with step acquisitions.
The gains were recognized in other income (loss), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)



(Unaudited) 



The purchase price allocation for acquisitions completed during recent periods is preliminary and subject to revision as additional information about fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available.
Additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at that time was unknown to us may become known to us during the remainder of the measurement period, a period not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date.
Adjustments in the purchase price allocation may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the period in which the acquisition occurred.
The goodwill generated from acquisitions completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 is primarily related to expected synergies.
The goodwill is generally not deductible for income tax purposes.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the operating results of each acquisition from the date of acquisition.
Divestiture of Service Provider Video Software Solutions On May 1, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our Service Provider Video Software Solutions ("SPVSS") business.
As of October 27, 2018, this business had tangible assets of approximately $165 million (primarily comprised of accounts receivables, inventories and various other current and long-term assets) and net intangible assets and goodwill (based on relative fair value) of $330 million.
In addition, the business had total liabilities of approximately $290 million (primarily comprised of deferred revenue and various other current and long-term liabilities).

6.Restructuring and Other Charges



We initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2018 (the "Fiscal 2018 Plan") in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas with estimated pretax charges of approximately $300 million.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expanded the restructuring plan to include an additional $300 million of estimated additional pretax charges.
These aggregate pretax charges are primarily cash-based and consist of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs.
We expect the Fiscal 2018 Plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2019.
We announced a restructuring plan in August 2016 (the "Fiscal 2017 Plan"), in order to reinvest in our key priority areas.
In connection with the Fiscal 2017 Plan, we incurred cumulative charges of approximately $1.0 billion, which were primarily cash-based and consisted of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs.

(a)Financing Receivables 



Financing receivables primarily consist of lease receivables, loan receivables, and financed service contracts.
Lease receivables consist of arrangements with terms of four years on average.
Loan receivables represent financing arrangements related to the sale of our hardware, software, and services, which may include additional funding for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services.
Loan receivables generally have terms of up to three years.
Financed service contracts include financing receivables related to technical support and advanced services.
Revenue related to the technical support services is typically deferred and included in deferred service revenue and is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed, which typically ranges from one to three years.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We determine the adequacy of our allowance for credit loss by assessing the risks and losses inherent in our financing receivables by portfolio segment.
The portfolio segment is based on the types of financing offered by us to our customers, which consist of the following: lease receivables, loan receivables, and financed service contracts.
Our internal credit risk ratings of 1 through 4 correspond to investment-grade ratings, while credit risk ratings of 5 and 6 correspond to non-investment grade ratings.
Credit risk ratings of 7 and higher correspond to substandard ratings.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Past due financing receivables are those that are 31 days or more past due according to their contractual payment terms.
The data in the preceding tables is presented by contract, and the aging classification of each contract is based on the oldest outstanding receivable, and therefore past due amounts also include unbilled and current receivables within the same contract.
The balances of either unbilled or current financing receivables included in the category of 91 days plus past due for financing receivables were $474 million and $503 million as of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018, respectively.
As of October 27, 2018, we had financing receivables of $234 million, net of unbilled or current receivables, that were in the category of 91 days plus past due but remained on accrual status as they are well secured and in the process of collection.
Such balance was $182 million as of July 28, 2018.

(c)Allowance for Credit Loss Rollforward 



The allowances for credit loss and the related financing receivables are summarized as follows (in millions): 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We assess the allowance for credit loss related to financing receivables on either an individual or a collective basis.
When the evaluation indicates that it is probable that all amounts due pursuant to the contractual terms of the financing agreement, including scheduled interest payments, are unable to be collected, the financing receivable is considered impaired.
All such outstanding amounts, including any accrued interest, will be assessed and fully reserved at the customer level.
Our internal credit risk ratings are categorized as 1 through 10, with the lowest credit risk rating representing the highest quality financing receivables.
Typically, we also consider receivables with a risk rating of 8 or higher to be impaired and will include them in the individual assessment for allowance.
These balances, as of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018, are presented under “(b) Credit Quality of Financing Receivables” above.
We evaluate the remainder of our financing receivables portfolio for impairment on a collective basis and record an allowance for credit loss at the portfolio segment level.

The average daily balance of securities lending was $0.5 billion as of each of the first quarters of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets.
We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses.
We did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented.
As of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions.
(d)Variable Interest Entities



In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers.
These privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities.
As of October 27, 2018, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $1.2 billion, of which $670 million of such investments are considered to be in variable interest entities which are unconsolidated.
In addition, we have additional funding commitments of $204 million related to these investments, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand.

Fair Value 



Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
(a)Fair Value Hierarchy



The accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
The standard establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The fair value hierarchy is as follows:



Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

(b)Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis



Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Level 1 marketable equity securities are determined by using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 available-for-sale debt investments are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data.
We use such pricing data as the primary input to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio and have not made, during the periods presented, any material adjustments to such inputs.
Our derivative instruments are primarily classified as Level 2, as they are not actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs.
We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the periods presented.
(c)Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis



The following table presents gains and losses on assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)



(Unaudited) 



These assets were measured at fair value due to events or circumstances we identified as having significant impact on their fair value during the respective periods.
The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities recorded to fair value on a non-recurring basis is adjusted for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment.
These securities are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs such as volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.
(d) Other Fair Value Disclosures 



The fair value of short-term loan receivables and financed service contracts approximates their carrying value due to their short duration.
The aggregate carrying value of long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts as of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018 was $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.
The estimated fair value of long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts approximates their carrying value.
We use significant unobservable inputs in determining discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts, and therefore they are categorized as Level 3.
As of October 27, 2018, the estimated fair value of our short-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the short maturities.
As of October 27, 2018, the fair value of our senior notes and other long-term debt was $26.2 billion with a carrying amount of $25.6 billion.
This compares to a fair value of $26.4 billion and a carrying amount of $25.6 billion as of July 28, 2018.
The fair value of the senior notes and other long-term debt was determined based on observable market prices in a less active market and was categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
11.Borrowings 



(a)Short-Term Debt



The following table summarizes our short-term debt (in millions, except percentages):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes.
We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes.
We had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018.
The effective rates for the short- and long-term debt include the interest on the notes, the accretion of the discount, the issuance costs, and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging.

(b)Long-Term Debt



The following table summarizes our long-term debt (in millions, except percentages):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We entered into interest rate swaps in prior periods with an aggregate notional amount of $6.75 billion designated as fair value hedges of certain of our fixed-rate senior notes.
These swaps convert the fixed interest rates of the fixed-rate notes to floating interest rates based on the London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR").
For additional information, see Note 12.
Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes and payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes.
Each of the senior fixed-rate notes is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium.
The senior notes rank at par with the commercial paper notes that may be issued in the future pursuant to our short-term debt financing program, as discussed above under “(a) Short-Term Debt.” As of October 27, 2018, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.

(c)Credit Facility



On May 15, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 15, 2020.
Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent (“Eurocurrency Rate”), for an interest period of one-month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than zero.
We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to May 15, 2022.
This credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.
As of October 27, 2018, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under this credit facility.

12.Derivative Instruments 



(a)Summary of Derivative Instruments



We use derivative instruments primarily to manage exposures to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and equity price risks.
We do, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions.
In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored.

(b)Offsetting of Derivative Instruments



We present our derivative instruments at gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
However, our master netting and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty.
To further limit credit risk, we also enter into collateral security arrangements related to certain derivative instruments whereby cash is posted as collateral between the counterparties based on the fair market value of the derivative instrument.
Information related to these offsetting arrangements is summarized as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(c)Foreign Currency Exchange Risk



We conduct business globally in numerous currencies.
Therefore, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
To limit the exposure related to foreign currency changes, we enter into foreign currency contracts.
We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.
These currency options and forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, generally have maturities of less than 24 months.
We assess effectiveness based on changes in total fair value of the derivatives.
The effective portion of the derivative instrument’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings.
The ineffective portion, if any, of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately.
During the periods presented, we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges for which it was probable that a forecasted transaction would not occur.
We enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities such as foreign currency receivables, including long-term customer financings, investments, and payables.
These derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments.
Gains and losses on the contracts are included in other income (loss), net, and substantially offset foreign exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of intercompany balances or other current assets, investments, or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity.
These derivative instruments generally have maturities of up to six months.
(d)Interest Rate Risk



Interest Rate Derivatives, Investments Our primary objective for holding available-for-sale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk.
To realize these objectives, we may utilize interest rate swaps or other derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges.
As of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018, we did not have any outstanding interest rate derivatives related to our available-for-sale debt investments.

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Interest Rate Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges, Long-Term Debt In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we did not enter into any interest rate swaps.
In prior fiscal years, we entered into interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges related to fixed-rate senior notes that are due in fiscal 2019 through 2025.
Under these interest rate swaps, we receive fixed-rate interest payments and make interest payments based on LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points.
The effect of such swaps is to convert the fixed interest rates of the senior fixed-rate notes to floating interest rates based on LIBOR.
The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest expense and substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market interest rates.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps was reflected in other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities.
To manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities, we have periodically entered into equity derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges.
The changes in the value of the hedging instruments are included in other income (loss), net, and offset the change in the fair value of the underlying hedged investment.
In addition, we periodically enter into equity derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges.
Although not designated as accounting hedges, we utilize derivatives such as total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure.
(f)Hedge Effectiveness 



For the periods presented, amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness were not material for fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedges.
In addition, hedge ineffectiveness for fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedges was not material for any of the periods presented.
13.Commitments and Contingencies 



(a)Operating Leases



We lease office space in many U.S. locations.
Outside the United States, larger leased sites include sites in Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Poland and the United Kingdom.
We also lease equipment and vehicles.
Future minimum lease payments under all noncancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year as of October 27, 2018 are as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(b)Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers 



We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products.
During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or establish the parameters defining our requirements.
Certain of these purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods.
As of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018, the liability for these purchase commitments was $150 million and $159 million, respectively, and was included in other current liabilities.
The following table summarizes the compensation expense related to acquisitions (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of October 27, 2018, we estimated that future cash compensation expense of up to $585 million may be required to be recognized pursuant to the applicable business combination agreements.
We also have certain funding commitments, primarily related to our non-marketable equity and other investments, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand.
The funding commitments were $378 million and $223 million as of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018, respectively.
Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty.
(e)Financing and Other Guarantees



In the ordinary course of business, we provide financing guarantees for various third-party financing arrangements extended to channel partners and end-user customers.
Payments under these financing guarantee arrangements were not material for the periods presented.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)



(Unaudited) 



Channel Partner Financing Guarantees We facilitate arrangements for third-party financing extended to channel partners, consisting of revolving short-term financing, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days.
These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and, in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements.
The volume of channel partner financing was $7.2 billion and $6.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $931 million and $953 million as of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018, respectively.
End-User Financing Guarantees We also provide financing guarantees for third-party financing arrangements extended to end-user customers related to leases and loans, which typically have terms of up to three years.
The volume of financing provided by third parties for leases and loans as to which we had provided guarantees was $3 million and $14 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.
These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.
We have been asked to indemnify Time Warner Cable (“TWC”) for patent infringement claims asserted against it by Sprint Communications Company, L.P. (“Sprint”) in federal court in Kansas.
Sprint alleges that TWC infringed certain Sprint patents by offering VoIP telephone services utilizing products provided by us generally in combination with those of other manufacturers.
Sprint seeks monetary damages.
Following a trial on March 3, 2017, a jury in Kansas found that TWC willfully infringed five Sprint patents and awarded Sprint $139.8 million in damages.
On March 14, 2017, the Kansas court declined Sprint's request for enhanced damages and entered judgment in favor of Sprint for $139.8 million plus 1.06% in post-judgment interest.
On May 30, 2017, the Court awarded Sprint $20.3 million in pre-judgment interest and denied TWC's post-trial motions.
TWC has appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Due to the uncertainty surrounding the litigation process, we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of the TWC litigation at this time.
In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.
(g)Legal Proceedings 



Brazil Brazilian authorities have investigated our Brazilian subsidiary and certain of our former employees, as well as a Brazilian importer of our products, and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer.
We do not expect a final judicial determination for several years.
SRI International  On September 4, 2013, SRI International, Inc. (“SRI”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, accusing our products and services in the area of network intrusion detection of infringing two U.S. patents.
The trial on these claims began on May 2, 2016 and, on May 12, 2016, the jury returned a verdict finding willful infringement of the asserted patents.
The jury awarded SRI damages of $23.7 million.
On May 25, 2017, the Court awarded SRI enhanced damages and attorneys’ fees, entered judgment in the new amount of $57.0 million, and ordered an ongoing royalty of 3.5% through the expiration of the patents in 2018.
Straight Path On September 24, 2014, Straight Path IP Group, Inc. (“Straight Path”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, accusing our 9971 IP Phone, Unified Communications Manager working in conjunction with 9971 IP Phones, and Video Communication Server products of infringement.
On November 13, 2017, the Court granted our motion for summary judgment of non-infringement, thereby dismissing Straight Path's claims against us and cancelling a trial which had been set for March 12, 2018.
On January 16, 2018, Straight Path appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit.
Arista Networks, Inc. As reported in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 28, 2018 we received a payment of $400 million from Arista Networks, Inc. ("Arista") in connection with the settlement of litigation.
Oyster Optics On November 24, 2016, Oyster Optics, LLC (“Oyster”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.
Oyster alleges that certain Cisco ONS 15454 and NCS 2000 line cards infringe U.S. Patent No.
7,620,327 (“the ‘327 Patent”).
Oyster seeks monetary damages.
Oyster's cases against some of the defendants were resolved.
The court vacated the November 4, 2018 trial date set for Oyster's claims against Cisco and one other remaining defendant, pending resolution of Oyster's appeal of the court's summary judgment ruling dismissing certain of Oyster's claims.

15.Employee Benefit Plans 



(a)Employee Stock Incentive Plans



Stock Incentive Plan Program Description As of October 27, 2018, we had one stock incentive plan: the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”).
In addition, we have, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, assumed the share-based awards granted under stock incentive plans of the acquired companies or issued share-based awards in replacement thereof.
Share-based awards are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions to us and provide incentives for them to remain with Cisco.
The number and frequency of share-based awards are based on competitive practices, operating results of Cisco, government regulations, and other factors.
If any awards granted under the 2005 Plan are forfeited or are terminated for any other reason before being exercised or settled, the unexercised or unsettled shares underlying the awards will again be available under the 2005 Plan.
In addition, starting November 19, 2013, shares withheld by Cisco from an award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right to satisfy withholding tax liabilities resulting from such award will again be available for issuance, based on the fungible share ratio in effect on the date of grant.
Pursuant to an amendment approved by our shareholders on November 12, 2009, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan is reduced by 1.5 shares for each share awarded as a stock grant or a stock unit, and any shares underlying awards outstanding from certain previous plans that expire unexercised at the end of their maximum terms become available for reissuance under the 2005 Plan.
The 2005 Plan permits the granting of stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units ("RSUs"), the vesting of which may be performance-based or market-based along with the requisite service requirement, and stock appreciation rights to employees (including employee directors and officers), consultants of Cisco and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and non-employee directors of Cisco.
Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2005 Plan have an exercise price of at least 100% of the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date.
The expiration date for stock options and stock appreciation rights shall be no later than 10 years from the grant date.
The stock options will generally become exercisable for 20% or 25% of the option shares one year from the date of grant and then ratably over the following 48 months or 36 months, respectively.
Time-based stock grants and time-based RSUs will generally vest over a four year term.
The majority of the performance-based and market-based RSUs vests at the end of the three-year requisite service period or earlier if the award recipient meets certain retirement eligibility conditions.
Certain performance-based RSUs, that are based on the achievement of financial and/or non-financial operating goals, typically vest upon the achievement of milestones (and may require subsequent service periods), with overall vesting of the shares underlying the award ranging from six months to three years.
The Compensation and Management Development Committee of our Board of Directors has the discretion to use different vesting schedules.
Stock appreciation rights may be awarded in combination with stock options or stock grants, and such awards shall provide that the stock appreciation rights will not be exercisable unless the related stock options or stock grants are forfeited.
Stock grants may be awarded in combination with non-statutory stock options, and such awards may provide that the stock grants will be forfeited in the event that the related non-statutory stock options are exercised.
(b)Employee Stock Purchase Plan



We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which includes its subplan named the International Employee Stock Purchase Plan (together, the “Purchase Plan”), under which 621 million shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance as of October 27, 2018.
Eligible employees are offered shares through a 24-month offering period, which consists of four consecutive 6-month purchase periods.
The Purchase Plan is scheduled to terminate on January 3, 2020.
No shares were issued under the Purchase Plan during each of the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.
As of October 27, 2018, 78 million shares were available for issuance under the Purchase Plan.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding table represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based on our closing stock price of $44.25 as of October 26, 2018.
The total number of in-the-money stock options exercisable as of October 27, 2018 was 4 million.
As of July 28, 2018, 4 million outstanding stock options were exercisable and the weighted-average exercise price was $6.84.
On the date of grant, we estimated the fair value of the total shareholder return ("TSR") component of the PRSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
For the awards based on financial performance metrics or comparative market-based returns, generally 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on the average of annual operating cash flow and earnings per share goals established at the beginning of each fiscal year over a three-year performance period.
Generally, the remaining 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on our TSR measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer group over the same period.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 includes a $152 million tax benefit relating to indirect effects from the adoption of ASC 606 at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
The measurement period ends when a company has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year.
This benefit may be reduced or eliminated in future legislation.
If such legislation is enacted, we will record the impact of the legislation in the quarter of enactment.
Specific positions that may be resolved include issues involving transfer pricing and various other matters.
We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits at October 27, 2018 could be reduced by approximately $200 million in the next 12 months.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Employee equity share options, unvested shares, and similar equity instruments granted and assumed by Cisco are treated as potential common shares outstanding in computing diluted earnings per share.
Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of in-the-money options, unvested restricted stock, and restricted stock units.
The dilutive effect of such equity awards is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method.
Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and the amount of compensation cost for future service that has not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
