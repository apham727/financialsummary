Finally, we believe this information provides more transparency.
The following provides additional detail on our Non-GAAP measures:



•We analyze our net sales and segment profit on an organic basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods.
Organic net sales and organic segment profit exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency, acquisitions, and dispositions (including the acquisition of Jack Black through February 2019 and the disposition of the Playtex gloves business through October 2018).
•Adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share are defined as net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding items such as restructuring charges, Feminine and Infant Care evaluation costs, the gain on the disposition of the Playtex gloves business, investor settlement expense, Jack Black acquisition and integration costs, Sun Care reformulation charges, the related tax effects of these items, and the impact of the Tax Act.

•Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less net capital expenditures.
Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings adjusted for the net impact of non-cash impairments.
All comparisons are with the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise noted.
Retail sales for purposes of market size, market position and market share information are based on retail sales in U.S. dollars.
We also may refer to brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies and organizations, and these brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names are the property of their respective owners.
Significant Events



Project Fuel



In February 2018, we announced Project Fuel, an enterprise-wide transformational initiative that is designed to address all aspects of our business and cost structure, simplifying and transforming the organization, structure and key processes that will provide the necessary catalyst for further re-investment in the Company’s growth objectives while enabling us to achieve our desired future state operations.
The project will incorporate our Zero-Based Spending (“ZBS”) and global productivity initiatives and will include a new global restructuring initiative.
Initial costs for Project Fuel relate to efforts to fully define the scope and reach of the project.
In addition, the Company has incurred global severance costs related to the reduction of overhead.
While the Company incurred costs and realized savings for Project Fuel in fiscal 2018, most costs will be incurred and savings will be achieved during fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2021.
For further information on our restructuring projects, refer to Note 4 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Feminine and Infant Care Evaluation Costs



In February 2019, we began exploring strategic alternatives for the Feminine Care and Infant Care businesses, including the potential sale of one or both businesses.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we incurred $1.0 of advisory expenses in connection with the evaluation of the Feminine and Infant Care businesses.
The costs are related to consulting fees for the analysis of strategic alternatives of the Feminine and Infant Care businesses and are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
34



Sun Care Reformulation Costs



As a result of discussions with one of our suppliers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we made certain supply chain and procurement decisions, including implementing a raw material substitution due to anticipated regulatory changes related to European Union Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals, establishing a European Chemical Agency (“REACH”), that affect the supply chain of select Sun Care products.
We incurred $0.4 and $0.5 in Sun Care reformulation costs during the three and six months ending March 31, 2019, respectively, and expect to incur additional charges over the remainder of fiscal 2019 related to these supply chain decisions.
The costs associated with the Sun Care reformulation are included in Costs of products sold on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
Acquisitions



On March 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Jack Black, a leading U.S. based luxury men’s skincare products company, for approximately $90.2, net of cash acquired.
The acquisition will create opportunities to expand our personal care portfolio in growing categories in the U.S. and globally, while nurturing the brand equity of Jack Black.
Refer to Note 3 of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to the acquisition of Jack Black.
Sale of Playtex Gloves Business



On October 26, 2017, the Company finalized its sale of the Playtex gloves business to a household products company (the “Acquirer”) for $19.0.
The sale was finalized on October 26, 2017.
The sale provides the Acquirer with indefinite and exclusive worldwide rights to the Playtex trademark for gloves.
The strategic sale of the Playtex gloves business will allow the Company to better focus and utilize its resources on its other product lines.
Total assets sold were $3.1, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $15.9 in the first six months of fiscal 2018.
The gain on sale of Playtex gloves recognized for fiscal year 2018 was $15.3.

Operating Results 



The following table presents changes in net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, as compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal 2018, and provides a reconciliation of organic net sales to reported amounts.
Net Sales



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For the second quarter of fiscal 2019, net sales were $546.7, a 10.1% decrease when compared with the prior year quarter.
Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Jack Black and currency movements, organic net sales decreased 8.9% driven by declines in Wet Shave, North America Sun and Skin Care and Feminine Care businesses, partly offset by Infant Care and International Sun and Skin Care businesses.
Organic net sales in both North America and Internationally declined 9%.
The decline in net sales was driven by North America Wet Shave, Sun and Skin Care and Feminine Care, driven by competitive pressure in key retailers and product launches in the prior year period, as well as declines in International, which were largely driven by expected lower Wet Shave net sales in Asia Pacific due to commercial distribution changes implemented in Japan that created a difficult comparison to the prior year.
37



For the first six months of fiscal 2019, net sales decreased 6.7%.
From a geographic perspective, organic net sales in North America declined 8% while International decreased 4%.
The decline in organic net sales was primarily due to declines across all segments in North America and International Wet Shave, driven by competitive pressure in key retailers and anniversary of prior year product launches and promotions.
For further discussion regarding net sales, including a summary of reported versus organic changes, see “Segment Results.”



Gross Profit 



Gross profit was $250.9 during the second quarter of fiscal 2019, as compared to $301.1 in the prior year period.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 45.9%, representing a 360 basis point decline over the prior year gross margin of 49.5%.
Excluding $0.4 of costs associated with the Sun Care Reformulation, gross margin decreased 350 basis points to 46.0%.
The decline was the result of lower volumes across Wet Shave, Sun and Skin Care, and Feminine Care (90 basis points) from prior year product launches and competition, unfavorable price mix in Wet Shave and Feminine Care in North America (140 basis points), and unfavorable cost mix (120 basis points) in Wet Shave.
Gross profit was $444.4 during the first six months of fiscal 2019, as compared to $500.4 in the prior year period.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2019 was 44.3%, down 220 basis points as compared to the prior year period.
The impact of lower volumes across all segments (90 basis points) from prior year product launches and competition, unfavorable price mix in Wet Shave related to a price decrease in North America and Feminine Care (90 basis points), and unfavorable cost mix in Wet Shave and All Other (40 basis points).
Selling, General and Administrative Expense



SG&A was $98.1 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, or 17.9% of net sales, as compared to $104.3 in the prior year period, or 17.2% of net sales.
Excluding $1.5 of SG&A associated with the acquisition of Jack Black, $1.9 of information technology enablement charges for Project Fuel, $1.0 of advisory expenses incurred in connection with the evaluation of the Feminine Care and Infant Care businesses, and $1.9 of favorable currency, SG&A declined by $8.5 in the second quarter.
SG&A was $185.4 in the first six months of fiscal 2019, or 18.5% of net sales, as compared to $202.2 in the prior year period, or 18.8% of net sales.
Excluding $4.3 of SG&A associated with the acquisition of Jack Black, $3.3 of information technology enablement charges for Project Fuel, $1.0 of expenses related to the evaluation of the Feminine and Infant Care businesses, $0.9 of expenses incurred in connection with an investor settlement, and $3.0 of favorable currency, SG&A as a percent of organic net sales decreased by 230 basis points.
These savings were offset in part by higher e-commerce investments.
Advertising and Sales Promotion Expense



For the second quarter of fiscal 2019, A&P was $47.9, down $27.7 as compared to the prior year period.
A&P as a percent of net sales was 8.8%, as compared to 12.4% in the prior year period.
For the first six months of fiscal 2019, A&P was $99.5, down $25.1 as compared to the prior year period.
A&P as a percent of net sales was 9.9%, as compared to 11.6% in the prior year period.
The decrease was driven by higher prior year spend in Wet Shave in support of new product innovation in men's Hydro® and women’s Intuition f.a.b.
in North America and lower Feminine Care spend compared to the prior year period, offset by increased support for the Skin Care and Grooming brands including Bulldog, Hydro grooming, and Jack Black.
38



Research and Development Expense



Research and development expense (“R&D”) for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $14.0, compared to $15.5 in the prior year period.
As a percent of sales, R&D was 2.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 2.5% in the prior year period.
The reduction in R&D as a percent of sales compared to the prior year is primarily driven by timing of spend and development and reduced headcount.
R&D for the first six months of fiscal 2019 was $26.6, compared to $31.6 in the prior year period.
As a percent of sales, R&D declined 30 basis points to 2.6% in the first six months of fiscal 2019 from 2.9% in the prior year.
The reduction in R&D as a percent of sales compared to the prior year is primarily driven by timing of spend and development and reduced headcount.
Interest Expense Associated with Debt



Interest expense associated with debt for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $16.4, a decrease from the prior year period of $18.2.
For the first six months of fiscal 2019, interest expense was $32.4 compared to $36.0 in the prior year period.
The decline in interest expense was the result of lower outstanding debt as the Company paid the Term Loan Due April 2019 offset by additional borrowings under the U.S. revolving credit facility in fiscal 2019.
Other Income, Net



Other income, net was $2.7 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $2.0 in the prior year period.
Other income, net was expense of $1.4 during the first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to expense of $0.7 during first six months of fiscal 2018.
Both periods reflect the reclassification of the pension credit from Cost of products sold and SG&A to Other income, net.
The impact of the pension benefit was $0.6 and $1.2 in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively.
The impact of the pension benefit was $1.8 and $3.5 in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018.
The remaining activity was for foreign currency exchange contract gains and losses and the revaluation of non-functional currency balance sheet exposures.
Income Tax Provision



The effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2019 was 33.0% compared to 39.7% in the prior year period.
The effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2019 includes a $4.7 net transitional charge resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the adjusted effective tax rate, which is a Non-GAAP measure:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Includes adjustments for the impact of the Tax Act, restructuring charges, Feminine and Infant Care evaluation costs, investor settlement expense, Jack Black acquisition and integration costs, Sun Care reformulation charges, and the gain on sale of the Playtex gloves business.
See reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings.

Savings Initiatives



Project Fuel is an enterprise-wide transformational initiative, launched in the second fiscal quarter of 2018, designed to address all aspects of our business and cost structure, simplifying and transforming the organization, structure and key processes that will provide the necessary catalyst for further re-investment in the Company’s growth objectives while enabling us to achieve its desired future state operations.
We expect Project Fuel will generate $225 to $240 in total annual gross savings by the end of the 2021 fiscal year.
To implement the restructuring element of Project Fuel, we estimate one-time pre-tax charges to be approximately $130 to $140, with an additional capital investment of $60 to $70 through the end of fiscal year 2021.
Project Fuel restructuring charges were $15.4 and $33.9 for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019.
Project Fuel restructuring charges totaled $3.7 for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018.
Additionally, capital expenditures for Project Fuel were $7.6 and $12.9, respectively.
Project Fuel related savings were approximately $29 and $54 for the three and six months ending March 31, 2019, respectively, bringing cumulative savings to approximately $70.

Wet Shave



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Wet Shave net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 14.7%, inclusive of a 2.8% decline, due to currency movements.
North America sales decreased as a result of declines in key retailers, price decreases in Men’s and Women’s Systems, and the anniversary of the launch of Intuition f.a.b.™ in the prior year quarter.
International sales declines were led by the Asia Pacific region, primarily driven by an expected quarterly phasing shift in sales in Japan and the impact of new product launches in the prior year.
In Europe, sales declines were driven by prior year launches of Schick Hydro Sense® and Intuition f.a.b.
Growth in Wet Shave net sales was driven through the launch of the Bulldog razor for Men’s systems, the launch of Skintimate® disposables, and growth in women’s private brands.
Wet Shave net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2019 decreased 8.9%, inclusive of a 2.2% decline due to currency movements.

North America organic net sales was down 9%, while International organic net sales decreased 5%.
Men's Systems volumes declined in North America due to competitive pressures.
Women's Systems declined globally due to the timing of the launch of Intuition f.a.b.

Sun and Skin Care



Sun and Skin Care segment net sales and segment profit are affected by the seasonality of sun care products.
As a result, segment net sales and segment profit historically have been higher in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Sun and Skin Care net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 4.7%, inclusive of a 3.5% increase due to the acquisition of Jack Black and a 1.6% decline due to currency movements.
Excluding the impact of the Jack Black acquisition and currency movements, organic net sales decreased $10.1, or 6.6% with declines in North America impacted by the Sun Care reformulation project and phasing of sales to the third quarter, partially offset by growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America, while Europe remained flat.
The decline in Sun and Skin Care was the result of lower Banana Boat volumes, while there were increased sales in Hawaiian Tropic.
Grooming net sales increased, partially offset by declines in Skin Care.
Sun and Skin Care net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2019 increased 0.2%, inclusive of an 8.1% increase due to the acquisition of Jack Black, a 0.5% decline due to the Playtex gloves sale and a 1.5% decline due to currency movements.

Corporate expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 remained flat compared to the prior year quarter.
Liquidity and Capital Resources



At March 31, 2019, substantially all our cash balances were located outside the U.S.
We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed.
We generally repatriate a portion of current year earnings from select non-U.S. subsidiaries only if the economic cost of the repatriation is not considered material.
The counterparties to deposits consist of several major financial institutions.
We consistently monitor positions with, and credit ratings of, counterparties both internally and by using outside ratings agencies.
Our total borrowings were $1,328.9 at March 31, 2019, including $215.0 tied to variable interest rates.
Our total borrowings at September 30, 2018 were $1,300.2.
As of March 31, 2019, we had outstanding borrowings of $215.0 under our unsecured revolving credit facility in the U.S. (the “Revolving Facility”) and $8.5 of outstanding letters of credit.
Taking into account outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit at March 31, 2019, $501.5 remains available under the Revolving Facility.
At September 30, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings of $7.0 under the Revolving Facility.
As of September 30, 2018, we had approximately $185.0 outstanding under the term loan due April 2019 (the “Term Loan”).
On February 6, 2019, the Company made a $185.0 prepayment to retire the Term Loan.
The Company funded the payment through additional borrowing on the Revolving Facility.
We had outstanding international borrowings, recorded in Notes payable, of $13.9 and $8.2 as of March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively.
We expect that fiscal 2019 free cash flow will be above 100% of GAAP net earnings.
Historically, we have generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations.
Our cash flows are affected by the seasonality of our sun care products, resulting in higher net sales and increased cash generated in the second and third quarter each year.
We believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and available borrowing under our current credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital requirements, interest payments, research and development activities, capital expenditures, and other financing requirements for at least the next twelve months.
Short-term financing needs primarily consist of working capital requirements, principal, and interest payments on our long-term debt.
Long-term financing needs will depend largely on potential growth opportunities, including acquisition activity and repayment or refinancing of our long-term debt obligations.
Our long-term liquidity may be influenced by our ability to borrow additional funds, renegotiate existing debt, and raise equity under terms that are favorable to us.
The expected minimum required contribution to our pension plans in fiscal 2019 is $7.3; however, discretionary contributions may also be made.
During the first six months of fiscal 2019 we contributed $2.5 to our pension plans.
As of March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with our debt agreements.

Cash Flows



A summary of our cash flow activities is provided in the following table:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Operating Activities



Cash flow used by operating activities was $31.9 during the first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to cash from operating activities of $61.6 during the same period in the prior year.
The decline in operating cash flow in the first six months of fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by working capital changes as the build in inventory for the Sun Care season in North America and the shift of Easter into the fiscal third quarter.
Additionally, accounts payable were higher at the end of fiscal 2018 as compared to March 31, 2019, resulting from the timing of payments and reduction in spending.
Investing Activities



Cash flow used by investing activities was $13.9 during the first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to cash used by investing activities of $88.9 during the same period in the prior year.
The change was primarily due to the acquisition of Jack Black for $90.3 in the prior year period offset by the sale of the Playtex gloves business in fiscal 2018 for $19.0.
Capital expenditures totaled $22.9 during the first six months of fiscal 2019 and included $12.9 of capital expenditures in support of Project Fuel, compared to $27.6 during the same period in the prior year.

Financing Activities



Net cash from financing activities was $27.3 during the first six months of fiscal 2019, compared to net cash used by financing activities of $243.2 during the same period in the prior year.
