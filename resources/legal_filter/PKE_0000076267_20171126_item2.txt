Cash and Marketable Securities 



Of the $241.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash at November 26, 2017, $233.0 million was owned by certain of the Company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries.
The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operating activities through the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter after giving consideration to the repayment of the Company’s debt in January 2018, payment of income taxes on repatriated foreign earnings in January 2018 and the expected payment of a special dividend in February 2018.
The change in cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash at November 26, 2017 compared to February 26, 2017 was the result of cash used in operating activities and a number of additional factors.
The significant changes in cash flows from operating activities were as follows: 



●   



accounts receivable decreased by 5% at November 26, 2017 compared to February 26, 2017 primarily due to lower sales in the quarter ended November 26, 2017 than in the fourth quarter of the 2017 fiscal year;    



●   



inventories increased by 3% at November 26, 2017 compared to February 26, 2017 primarily due to an increase in raw materials;    



    ●   prepaid expenses increased by 9% at November 26, 2017 compared to February 26, 2017 primarily due to an increase in accrued interest on our marketable securities;    



●   



accounts payable decreased by 18% at November 26, 2017 compared to February 26, 2017 primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and raw material purchases from suppliers;    



    ●   accrued liabilities increased by 94% at November 26, 2017 compared to February 26, 2017 primarily due to the accrual of restructuring costs related to the consolidation of the Company’s Nelco Products, Inc. Electronics Business Unit in California and its Neltec, Inc. Electronics Business Unit in Arizona; and    



●   



income taxes payable decreased by 80% at November 26, 2017 compared to February 26, 2017 primarily due to income tax payments made during the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017.
In addition, the Company paid $6.1 million in cash dividends in each of the 39-week periods ended November 26, 2017 and November 27, 2016.
During the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, the Company also made $2.75 million of principal payments on its long-term debt.
Working Capital 



The decrease in working capital at November 26, 2017 compared to February 26, 2017 was due principally to the increase in accrued liabilities and the decreases in accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, partially offset by increases in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets, and decreases in income taxes payable, accounts payable and the current portion of long-term debt.
22 



The Company's current ratio (the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 19.2 to 1 at November 26, 2017 compared to 19.1 to 1 at February 26, 2017.
Cash Flows 



During the 39 weeks ended November 26, 2017, the Company's net earnings, before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of bond premium and changes in operating assets and liabilities, were $5.0 million.
During the same 39 week period, the Company expended $703,000 for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, compared with $194,000 during the 39 weeks ended November 27, 2016.
The Company paid $6.1 million in cash dividends in each of the 39-week periods ended November 26, 2017 and November 27, 2016.
Debt 



At November 26, 2017 and February 26, 2017, the Company had $69.3 million and $72.0 million of bank debt, respectively.
In the fourth quarter of the 2016 fiscal year, the Company entered into a three-year revolving credit facility agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with HSBC Bank.
The Credit Agreement provided for loans up to $75.0 million to the Company and letters of credit up to $2.0 million for the account of the Company, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, an interest rate on the outstanding loan balance of LIBOR plus 1.15% to LIBOR plus 2.65%.
The Credit Agreement contained certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary financial covenants.
On January 3, 2018 the company voluntarily prepaid the remaining loan balance of $68,500 and terminated the Credit Agreement.
For additional information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.
Other Liquidity Factors 



The Company believes its financial resources will be sufficient, through the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter, to provide for continued investment in working capital and property, plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes after giving consideration to the repayment of the Company’s debt in January 2018, payment of income taxes on repatriated foreign earnings in January 2018 and the expected payment of a special dividend in February 2018.
The Company’s financial resources are also available for purchases of the Company's common stock, appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the Company's business.
Contractual Obligations: 



The Company's contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts, such as lease agreements, consist only of (i) operating lease commitments and (ii) commitments to purchase raw materials.
The Company has no other long-term debt, capital lease obligations, unconditional purchase obligations or other long-term obligations, standby letters of credit, guarantees, standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments or contingent commitments, other than two standby letters of credit in the total amount of $1.0 million to secure the Company's obligations under its workers' compensation insurance program.
23 



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: 



The Company's liquidity is not dependent on the use of, and the Company is not engaged in, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, such as securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities.
There have been no significant changes to such accounting policies during the 2018 fiscal year third quarter.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification.
This guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and expands the related disclosure requirements.
The new standard was originally scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years.
In August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date of this guidance for one year.
With the delay, the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, with an option to adopt the standard on the originally scheduled effective date.
A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue.
The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach, such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters.
