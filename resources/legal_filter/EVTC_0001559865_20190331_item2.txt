Executive Summary



EVERTEC is a leading full-service transaction processing business in Latin America and the Caribbean, providing a broad range of merchant acquiring, payment services and business process management services.
According to the August 2018 Nilson Report, we are one of the largest merchant acquirers in Latin America based on total number of transactions and we believe we are the largest merchant acquirer in the Caribbean and Central America.
We serve 26 countries in the region from our base in Puerto Rico.
We manage a system of electronic payment networks that process more than two billion transactions annually, and offer a comprehensive suite of services for core bank processing, cash processing and technology outsourcing.
In addition, we own and operate the ATH network, one of the leading debit networks in Latin America.
We serve a diversified customer base of leading financial institutions, merchants, corporations and government agencies with “mission-critical” technology solutions that enable them to issue, process and accept transactions securely.
We believe our business is well-positioned to continue to expand across the fast-growing Latin American region.
We believe these competitive advantages include:



•Our ability to provide competitive products; 



•Our ability to provide in one package a range of services that traditionally had to be sourced from different vendors; 



•Our ability to serve customers with disparate operations in several geographies with technology solutions that enable them to manage their business as one enterprise; and 



•Our ability to capture and analyze data across the transaction processing value chain and use that data to provide value-added services that are differentiated from those offered by pure-play vendors that serve only one portion of the transaction processing value chain (such as only merchant acquiring or payment services).
Our broad suite of services spans the entire transaction processing value chain and includes a range of front-end customer-facing solutions such as the electronic capture and authorization of transactions at the point-of-sale, as well as back-end support services such as the clearing and settlement of transactions and account reconciliation for card issuers.
These include: (i) merchant acquiring services, which enable point of sales (“POS”) and e-commerce merchants to accept and process electronic methods of payment such as debit, credit, prepaid and electronic benefit transfer (“EBT”) cards; (ii) payment processing services, which enable financial institutions and other issuers to manage, support and facilitate the processing for credit, debit, 



21

prepaid, automated teller machines (“ATM”) and EBT card programs; and (iii) business process management solutions, which provide “mission-critical” technology solutions such as core bank processing, as well as IT outsourcing and cash management services to financial institutions, corporations and governments.
We provide these services through scalable, end-to-end technology platforms that we manage and operate in-house and that generates significant operating efficiencies that enable us to maximize profitability.
Our revenue is predominantly recurring in nature because of the mission-critical and embedded nature of the services we provide.
Corporate Background



EVERTEC, Inc. ("EVERTEC", formerly known as Carib Latam Holdings, Inc.) is a Puerto Rico corporation organized in April 2012.
Our main operating subsidiary, EVERTEC Group, LLC (formerly known as EVERTEC, LLC and EVERTEC, Inc., hereinafter “EVERTEC Group”), was organized in Puerto Rico in 1988.
EVERTEC Group was formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Popular.
On September 30, 2010, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), AP Carib Holdings, Ltd. (“Apollo”), an affiliate of Apollo Global Management LLC, acquired a 51% indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC Group as part of a merger (the “Merger”) and EVERTEC Group became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings.
On April 17, 2012, EVERTEC Group was converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company (the “Conversion”) for the purpose of improving its consolidated tax efficiency by taking advantage of changes to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “PR Code”), that permit limited liability companies to be treated as partnerships that are pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes.
Prior to these conversions, EVERTEC, Inc. was formed in order to act as the new parent company of Holdings and its subsidiaries, including EVERTEC Group.
The transactions described above in this paragraph are collectively referred to as the “Reorganization.” 



Separation from and Key Relationship with Popular



Prior to the Merger on September 30, 2010, EVERTEC Group was 100% owned by Popular, the largest financial institution in the Caribbean, and operated substantially as an independent entity within Popular.
After the consummation of the Merger, Popular retained an indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC Group and is our largest customer.
In connection with, and upon consummation of the Merger, EVERTEC Group entered into a 15-year Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”), and several related agreements with Popular.
Under the terms of the MSA, Popular agreed to continue to use EVERTEC services on an ongoing and exclusive basis, for the duration of the agreement, on commercial terms consistent with those of our historical relationship.
Additionally, Popular granted us a right of first refusal on the development of certain new financial technology products and services for the duration of the MSA.
For example, currently the adoption of banking products, including electronic payments, in the Latin American and Caribbean regions is lower relative to the mature U.S. and European markets.
We also benefit from the trend for financial institutions and government agencies to outsource technology systems and processes.
Many medium- and small-size institutions in the Latin American markets in which we operate have outdated computer systems and updating these IT legacy systems is financially and logistically challenging, which presents a business opportunity for us.

On June 30, 2016, the U.S. President signed into law PROMESA.
PROMESA establishes a fiscal oversight and the Oversight Board comprised of seven voting members appointed by the President.
The Oversight Board has broad budgetary and financial powers over Puerto Rico’s budget, laws, financial plans and regulations, including the power to approve restructuring agreements with creditors, file petitions for restructuring and reform the electronic system for the tax collection.
The Oversight Board will have ultimate authority in preparing the Puerto Rico government’s budget and any issuance of future debt by the government and its instrumentalities.
In addition, PROMESA imposes an automatic stay on all litigation against Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, as well as any other judicial or administrative actions or proceedings to enforce or collect claims against the Puerto Rico government.
On May 1, 2017, the automatic stay expired.
Promptly after the expiration of the stay, creditors of the Puerto Rico government filed various lawsuits involving defaults on more than $70 billion of bonds issued by Puerto Rico, having failed to reach a negotiated settlement on such defaults with the Puerto Rico government during the period of the automatic stay.
On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board filed a voluntary petition of relief on behalf of the Commonwealth pursuant to Title III of PROMESA for the restructuring of the Commonwealth’s debt.
Subsequently, the Oversight Board filed voluntary petitions of relief pursuant to Title III of PROMESA on behalf certain public corporations and instrumentalities.
Title III is an in-court debt restructuring proceeding similar to protections afforded debtors under Chapter 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”); the Bankruptcy Code is not available to the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities.
As the solution to the Puerto Rican government’s debt crisis remains unclear, we continue to carefully monitor our receivables with the government as well as monitor general economic trends to understand the impact the crisis has on the economy of Puerto Rico and our card payment volumes.
In addition to the macroeconomic trends described above, Management currently estimates that we will continue to experience a revenue attrition in Latin America of approximately $3 million to $4 million for previously disclosed migrations anticipated in 2019.
The clients' decisions, which were made prior to 2015, for these anticipated migrations were driven by a variety of historical factors, most importantly customer service experience.
Results of Operations



Comparison of the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Revenues



Total revenues in the first quarter of 2019 increased by $8.6 million or 8% to $118.8 million.
Additionally, revenue growth was a result of an increase in network services related to new managed services projects, as well as, a one-time revenue related to an electronic benefits contract of approximately $2.7 million.
23

Cost of revenues 



Cost of revenues amounted to $50.0 million, an increase of $2.6 million or 5% when compared with the prior year period.
Selling, general and administrative



Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2019 increased by $1.7 million or 13% when compared with the same quarter in 2018.
Depreciation and amortization



Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $16.3 million, an increase of $0.4 million or 3%.
The increase is mainly related to higher capital expenditures in prior year as well as impact from development projects going into production.
Non-operating income (expenses)



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Non-operating expenses increased by $0.4 million to $6.9 million when compared with the prior year period.
The increase is mainly related to a $0.6 million decrease in Other income, net due to a decrease in foreign exchange gains relative to the same quarter in 2018.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.5%, compared with 14.5% in the 2018 period.
Segment Results of Operations



The Company operates in four business segments: Payment Services - Puerto Rico & Caribbean, Payment Services - Latin America, Merchant Acquiring, and Business Solutions.
The Payment Services - Puerto Rico & Caribbean segment revenues are comprised of revenues related to providing access to the ATH debit network and other card networks to financial institutions, including related services such as authorization, processing, management and recording of ATM and POS transactions, and ATM management and monitoring.
The segment revenues also include revenues from card processing services (such as credit and debit card processing, authorization and settlement and fraud monitoring and control to debit or credit issuers), payment processing services (such as payment and billing products for merchants, businesses and financial institutions) and electronic benefit transfer (“EBT”) (which principally consist of services to the government of Puerto Rico for the delivery of benefits to participants).
For ATH debit network and processing services, revenues are primarily driven by the number of transactions processed.
Revenues are derived primarily 



24

from network fees, transaction switching and processing fees, and the leasing POS devices.
For card issuer processing, revenues are primarily dependent upon the number of cardholder accounts on file, transactions and authorizations processed, the number of cards embossed and other processing services.
For EBT services, revenues are primarily derived from the number of beneficiaries on file.
The Payment Services - Latin America segment revenues consist of revenues related to providing access to the ATH network and other card networks to financial institutions, including related services such as authorization, processing, management and recording of ATM and POS transactions, and ATM management and monitoring.
The segment revenues also include revenues from card processing services (such as credit and debit card processing, authorization and settlement and fraud monitoring and control to debit or credit issuers), payment processing services (such as payment and billing products for merchants, businesses and financial institutions), as well as, licensed software solutions for risk and fraud management and card payment processing.
For ATH debit network and processing services, revenues are primarily driven by the number of transactions processed.
Revenues are derived primarily from network fees, transaction switching and processing fees, and the leasing POS devices.
For card issuer processing, revenues are primarily dependent upon the number of cardholder accounts on file, transactions and authorizations processed, the number of cards embossed and other processing services.
The Merchant Acquiring segment consists of revenues from services that allow merchants to accept electronic methods of payment.
In the Merchant Acquiring segment, revenues include a discount fee and membership fees charged to merchants, debit network fees and rental fees from POS devices and other equipment, net of credit card interchange and assessment fees charged by credit cards associations (such as VISA or MasterCard) or payment networks.
The discount fee is generally a percentage of the transaction value.
EVERTEC also charges merchants for other services that are unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value.
The Business Solutions segment consists of revenues from a full suite of business process management solutions in various product areas such as core bank processing, network hosting and management, IT professional services, business process outsourcing, item processing, cash processing, and fulfillment.
Core bank processing and network services revenues are derived in part from a recurrent fee and from fees based on the number of accounts on file (i.e.
savings or checking accounts, loans, etc.)
or computer resources utilized.
Revenues from other processing services within the Business Solutions segment are generally volume-based and depend on factors such as the number of accounts processed.
In addition, EVERTEC is a reseller of hardware and software products and these resale transactions are generally one-time transactions.
In addition to the four operating segments described above, Management identified certain functional cost areas that operate independently and do not constitute businesses in themselves.
These units could neither be concluded as operating segments nor could they be combined with any other operating segments.
Management evaluates the operating results of each of its operating segments based upon revenues and Adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to operating segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, "Segment Reporting" given that it is reported to the CODM for purposes of allocating resources.
Segment asset disclosure is not used by the CODM as a measure of segment performance since the segment evaluation is driven by revenues and adjusted EBITDA performance.
As such, segment assets are not disclosed in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The following tables set forth information about the Company’s operations by its four business segments for the periods indicated below.
Comparison of the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018



Payment Services - Puerto Rico & Caribbean



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Payment Services - Puerto Rico & Caribbean segment revenue increased by $4.8 million to $32.0 million when compared with the 2018 period.
The increase in revenues was driven by higher ATM Network and POS transaction volumes coupled with new transaction fees, growth over the prior year, as January and February in the prior year were still recovering from the 2017 hurricanes, and one-time revenue related to an electronic benefits contract of approximately $2.7 million.
Adjusted EBITDA increased by $4.0 million to $21.3 million primarily due to higher revenues from the electronic benefits contract.
Payment Services - Latin America



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Payment Services - Latin America segment revenue increased $0.4 million to $20.8 million driven mainly by higher intercompany software sale and development revenues from the Payment Services - Latin America segment to the Payment Services Puerto Rico & Caribbean segment, partially offset by one-time sales and revenue from completed implementations in the prior year that did not recur and impact from client attrition.
Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.3 million when compared to the prior year period, due to increased revenue associated to intercompany services and licenses sold to Payment Services - Puerto Rico & Caribbean segment.
Merchant Acquiring



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Merchant Acquiring segment revenue increased $2.6 million to $26.0 million due to increased sales volumes compared to results in prior year, which was negatively impacted by the 2017 hurricanes, and by electronic benefit disaster recovery funding that started in March 2018 and ended in March 2019.
Increases in transactional fees contributed to higher net spreads versus the same period in the previous year, while higher non-transactional fees also helped to drive the year-over-year revenue increase.
Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.1 million mainly due to increased sales volumes and higher transactional and non-transactional fees, partially offset by higher transaction processing charges and lower average ticket versus the first quarter of 2018. 



Business Solutions



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Business Solutions segment revenue increased $3.4 million or 7% mainly driven by new services provided to Popular and incremental managed services revenues from the Government of Puerto Rico.
Liquidity and Capital Resources



Our principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, and our primary liquidity requirements are the funding of capital expenditures, working capital needs and acquisitions.
We also have a $125.0 million Revolving Facility, of which $82.9 million was available as of March 31, 2019.
At March 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $73.2 million, of which $48.4 million resides in our subsidiaries located outside of Puerto Rico for purposes of (i) funding the respective subsidiary’s current business operations and (ii) funding potential future investment outside of Puerto Rico.
We intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of Puerto Rico, and based on our liquidity forecast, we will not need to repatriate this cash to fund the Puerto Rico operations or to meet debt-service obligations.
Based on our current level of operations, we believe our cash flows from operations and the available secured Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $29.3 million compared with cash provided by operating activities of $30.4 million for the corresponding 2018 period.
The $1.0 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by more cash used to pay down accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and income taxes, partially offset by more collections of accounts receivable.
Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $14.0 million compared with $9.4 million for the corresponding period in 2018.
The $4.6 million increase is attributable to increases in capital expenditures.
Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $15.6 million compared with $17.4 million for the corresponding 2018 period.
The $1.7 million decrease was mainly related to a $15.0 million draw on our Revolving Facility, compared with a $12.0 million paydown in the prior year, coupled with a $1.5 million decrease is cash used to paydown long-term debt.
This decrease was partially offset by cash dividends paid amounting to $3.6 million and cash used for repurchases of common stock of $17.5 million, while in the prior year no cash was used for these activities, and a $5.7 million increase in cash used for payment of statutory withholding taxes for share-based compensation.
27

Capital Resources



Our principal capital expenditures are for hardware and computer software (purchased and internally developed) and additions to property and equipment.
We invested approximately $14.0 million and $9.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The dividend will be paid on June 7, 2019 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 6, 2019.
Financial Obligations



Secured Credit Facilities

In May 2016, EVERTEC Group entered into a non-interest bearing financing agreement amounting to $0.7 million to purchase software.
As of both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the outstanding principal balance of the note payable is $0.3 million.
The current portion of these notes is recorded as part of accounts payable and the long-term portion is included in other long-term liabilities.
In January 2019, EVERTEC Group entered into a non-interest bearing financing agreement amounting to $10.0 million to purchase data processing equipment and maintenance.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The Company has accounted for these transactions as cash flow hedges.
As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the carrying amount of the derivatives on the Company’s balance sheets is as follows:



28

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company reclassified gains of $0.3 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss into income through interest expense.
Based on current LIBOR rates, the Company expects to reclassify gains of $1.0 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss into income through interest expense over the next 12 months.
The cash flow hedge is considered highly effective.
Covenant Compliance



As of March 31, 2019, the secured leverage ratio was 2.31 to 1.00.
As of the date of filing of this Form 10-Q, no event has occurred that constitutes an Event of Default or Default.
Net Income Reconciliation to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share (Non-GAAP Measures)



We define “EBITDA” as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments described below.
Adjusted EBITDA by segment is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance.
For this reason Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K. We define “Adjusted Net Income” as net income adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments described below.
We define “Adjusted Earnings per common share” as Adjusted Net Income divided by diluted shares outstanding.
In addition, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is substantially consistent with the equivalent measurements that are contained in the senior secured credit facilities in testing EVERTEC Group’s compliance with covenants therein such as the senior secured leverage ratio.
In addition, in evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses such as those excluded in calculating them.
Some of the limitations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted earnings per common share are as follows: 



•they do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures or future contractual commitments;



•they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital;



•although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements;



•in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest, or principal payments, on indebtedness;



•in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, they do not reflect income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes; and



•other companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings per common share or may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share differently than as presented in this Report, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.
29

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share are not measurements of liquidity or financial performance under GAAP.
You should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with GAAP.
A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share is provided below:
