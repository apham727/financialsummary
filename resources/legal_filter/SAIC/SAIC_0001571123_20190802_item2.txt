We use the terms "SAIC," the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” to refer to Science Applications International Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We are a leading technology integrator providing full life cycle services and solutions in the technical, engineering and enterprise information technology (IT) markets. We developed our brand by addressing our customers’ mission critical needs and solving their most complex problems for over 50 years. As one of the largest pure-play technical service providers to the U.S. government, we serve markets of significant scale and opportunity. Our primary customers are the departments and agencies of the U.S. government. We serve our customers through approximately 2,200 active contracts and task orders and employ more than 23,000 individuals who are led by an experienced executive team of proven industry leaders. Our long history of serving the U.S. government has afforded us the ability to develop strong and longstanding relationships with some of the largest customers in the markets we serve. Substantially all of our revenues and tangible long-lived assets are generated by or owned by entities located in the United States.
In fiscal year 2019, we generated greater than 95% of our revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, including subcontracts on which we perform. Our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. government spending and the alignment of our offerings and capabilities with the budget priorities of the U.S. government. Appropriations measures passed in September 2018 and February 2019, when combined, provide full funding for the federal government through the end of government fiscal year (GFY) 2019. These bills are funded at increased levels for defense and non-defense spending based on a bi-partisan agreement reached in February 2018 to lift caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), providing additional business opportunities for the Company. 
In July 2019, Congress passed, and the President signed, legislation that would increase the caps for GFY 2020 and GFY 2021 by a total of $323 billion. GFY 2020 and GFY 2021 are the final two years of the BCA limits on discretionary spending, so enactment of this measure effectively ends the threat of sequestration going forward (there remain caps for additional years on certain mandatory spending accounts, but these have little to no effect on our business). The cap increases also were paired with an extension of the federal debt limit until July 31, 2021, postponing the threat of a federal government default.
While the cap increases prevent sequestration under the BCA, Congress has not yet passed any GFY 2020 appropriations measures. This makes it likely that one or more continuing resolutions (CRs) will be necessary to fund the government past September 30, and there remains a possibility that political and policy disputes could result in a full or partial government shutdown later this year.
Despite the budget and competitive pressures affecting the industry, we believe we are well-positioned to protect and expand existing customer relationships and benefit from opportunities that we have not previously pursued. Our scale, size, and prime contractor leadership position are expected to help differentiate us from our competitors, especially on large contract opportunities. We believe our long-term, trusted customer relationships and deep technical expertise provide us with the sophistication to handle highly complex, mission-critical contracts. SAIC’s value proposition is found in the proven ability to serve as a trusted adviser to our customers. In doing so, we leverage our expertise and scale to help them execute their mission.
We succeed as a business based on the solutions we deliver, our past performance, and our ability to compete on price. Our solutions are inspired through innovation based on adoption of best practices and technology integration of the best capabilities available. Our past performance was achieved by employees dedicated to supporting our customers’ most challenging missions. Our current cost structure and ongoing efforts to reduce costs by strategic sourcing and developing repeatable offerings are expected to allow us to compete effectively on price in an evolving environment. Our ability to be competitive in the future will continue to be driven by our reputation for successful program execution, competitive cost structure, and efficiencies in assigning the right people, at the right time, in support of our contracts.
Management of Operating Performance and Reporting
Our business and program management process is directed by professional managers focused on satisfying our customers by providing high quality services in achieving program requirements. These managers carefully monitor contract margin performance by constantly evaluating contract risks and opportunities. Through each contract's life cycle, program managers review performance and update contract performance estimates to reflect their understanding of the best information available. For performance obligations satisfied over time, updates to estimates are recognized on inception-to-date activity, during the period of adjustment, resulting in either a favorable or unfavorable impact to operating income.
Results of Operations
Revenues. Revenues increased $479 million or 43.0% for the three months ended August 2, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year due to the acquisition of Engility. Adjusting for the impact of acquired revenues, revenues were consistent with the prior year quarter.
Revenues increased $919 million or 40.1% for the six months ended August 2, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year due to the acquisition of Engility. Adjusting for the impact of acquired revenues, revenues contracted 1.4%, attributable to humanitarian relief materials in the prior year and the effect of acquisition related dis-synergies.
Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased $406 million for the three months ended August 2, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Engility. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased from 90.0% in the prior year quarter to 88.4%, as a result of the acquisition of Engility.
Cost of revenues increased $767 million for the six months ended August 2, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Engility. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased from 90.7% in the prior year quarter to 88.6%, due to the Engility acquisition and improved performance across our portfolio including higher net favorable changes in estimates related to performance obligations satisfied over time ($15 million).
Operating Income. Operating income as a percentage of revenues of 6.0% for the three months ended August 2, 2019 decreased from 6.6% in the comparable prior year period due to increased intangible asset amortization and acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Engility, partially offset by cost synergies.
Operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 5.9% for the six months ended August 2, 2019 from 6.1% in the comparable prior year period primarily due to increased intangible asset amortization and acquisition and integration costs related to the Engility acquisition, partially offset by cost synergies and improved performance across our portfolio.
Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders. Net income attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended August 2, 2019 increased $8 million as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased operating income ($16 million, net of tax), partially offset by higher interest expense.
Net income attributable to common stockholders for the six months ended August 2, 2019 increased $14 million as compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher operating income ($40 million, net of tax), partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $273 million for the six months ended August 2, 2019, an increase of $197 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to cash provided from the operating activities of Engility, strong customer collections across several programs, and customer collections recouped from the U.S. federal government partial shutdown that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that is calculated by taking net income and excluding interest, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking EBITDA and excluding acquisition and integration costs that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. The acquisition and integration costs relate to the Company's significant acquisition of Engility. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended August 2, 2019 increased to 8.4% of revenues from 7.5% of revenues for the prior year driven by the acquisition of Engility and cost synergies related to the acquisition.
Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended August 2, 2019 increased to 8.4% of revenues from 7.0% of revenues for the prior year, driven by the acquisition of Engility, cost synergies related to the acquisition and improved performance across our portfolio including higher net favorable changes in estimates related to performance obligations satisfied over time.
Net Bookings and Backlog. Net bookings represent the estimated amount of revenues to be earned in the future from funded and negotiated unfunded contract awards that were received during the period, net of adjustments to estimates on previously awarded contracts. We calculate net bookings as the period’s ending backlog plus the period’s revenues less the prior period’s ending backlog and initial backlog obtained through acquisitions.
Backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed. We do not include in backlog estimates of revenues to be derived from IDIQ contracts, but rather record backlog and bookings when task orders are awarded on these contracts. Given that much of our revenue is derived from IDIQ contract task orders that renew annually, bookings on these contracts tend to refresh annually as the task orders are renewed. Additionally, we do not include in backlog contract awards that are under protest until the protest is resolved in our favor.
•Funded Backlog. Funded backlog for contracts with government agencies primarily represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from contracts for which funding is appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts. It does not include the unfunded portion of contracts in which funding is incrementally appropriated or authorized on a quarterly or annual basis by the U.S. government and other customers even though the contract may call for performance over a number of years. Funded backlog for contracts with non-government customers represents the estimated value on contracts, which may cover multiple future years, under which we are obligated to perform, less revenues previously recognized on these contracts.
•Negotiated Unfunded Backlog. Negotiated unfunded backlog represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from negotiated contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized and from unexercised priced contract options. Negotiated unfunded backlog does not include any estimate of future potential task orders expected to be awarded under IDIQ, GSA Schedules or other master agreement contract vehicles.
We had net bookings worth an estimated $1.9 billion and $3.3 billion during the three and six months ended August 2, 2019. Total backlog at the end of the second quarter is consistent with our total backlog at prior year end.
Our contract mix for the six months ended August 2, 2019 reflects an increase in cost reimbursement type contracts due the acquisition of Engility, which historically had a higher proportion of cost reimbursement type contracts, and a change in contract type on a significant contract supporting the Department of Defense.
Cost of revenues mix for the three and six months ended August 2, 2019 reflects an increase in labor-related content due to the acquisition of Engility, which historically had a higher proportion of such costs.
As a services provider, our business generally requires minimal infrastructure investment. We expect to fund our ongoing working capital, commitments and any other discretionary investments with cash on hand, future operating cash flows and, if needed, borrowings under our $400 million Revolving Credit Facility.
We anticipate that our future cash needs will be for working capital, capital expenditures, and contractual and other commitments. We consider various financial measures when we develop and update our capital deployment strategy, which includes evaluating cash provided by operating activities, free cash flow and financial leverage. When our cash generation enables us to exceed our target average minimum cash balance, we intend to deploy excess cash through dividends, share repurchases, debt prepayments or strategic acquisitions.
Historical Cash Flow Trends
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Refer to “Results of Operations” above for a discussion of the changes in cash provided by operating activities between the six months ended August 2, 2019 and the comparable prior year period.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended August 2, 2019 increased compared to the prior year period due to purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by lower capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended August 2, 2019 increased compared to the prior year period primarily due to $150 million of voluntary principal prepayments on the Term Loan A Facility, increase in stock repurchased and retired or withheld for taxes on equity awards and an increase in dividend payments to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings on our revolver.
There have been no changes to our existing critical accounting policies, other than our accounting policy on leases, during the six months ended August 2, 2019 from those disclosed in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. We revised our accounting policy on leases in conjunction with our adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02. See Note 10 of the notes to the condensed and consolidated financial statements contained within this report.
