See "Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this discussion.
Overview



CDW Corporation ("Parent") is a Fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated information technology ("IT") solutions to small, medium and large business, and government, education and healthcare customers in the United States ("US"), the United Kingdom ("UK") and Canada.
Our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration.
We are technology "agnostic," with a portfolio including more than 100,000 products and services from more than 1,000 leading and emerging brands.
Our solutions are delivered in physical, virtual and cloud-based environments through over 6,000 customer-facing coworkers, including sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers.
We are a leading sales channel partner for many original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), software publishers and cloud providers (collectively, our "vendor partners"), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer.
We provide our vendor partners with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage, technical expertise and extensive customer access.
Our Corporate segment primarily serves US private sector business customers with more than 250 employees.
Our Small Business segment primarily serves US private sector business customers with up to 250 employees.
Our Public segment is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the US.
We also have two other operating segments: CDW UK and CDW Canada, each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category ("Other").
We may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer.
Each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements.
We also resell software for major software publishers.
Our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services.
In addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals.
A significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses are reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners.
Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended ("Topic 606"), utilizing the full retrospective method as discussed in Note 2 (Recent Accounting Pronouncements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Prior period amounts have been adjusted accordingly.
This is particularly the case for business customers, as their purchases tend to reflect confidence in their business prospects, which are driven by their perceptions of business conditions.
•Changes in spending policies, budget priorities and funding levels are a key factor influencing the purchasing levels of government, healthcare and education customers.
37

•Technology trends drive customer purchasing behaviors in the market.
These trends are driving customer adoption of solutions such as those delivered via cloud, software defined architectures and hybrid on-premise and off-premise combinations.
We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per common share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, return on working capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable plus days of supply in Inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios, sales per coworker and coworker turnover.
These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.
In this Form 10-Q, we discuss Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business.
Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure in the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility ("Term Loan"), which is used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments.
For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 6 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
The results of certain business metrics are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



(1)Amounts for 2017 have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of Topic 606.
(2)There were 63 selling days for both the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.

Results of Operations



Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 



Results of operations, in dollars and as a percentage of Net sales are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Amounts for 2017 have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of Topic 606.
(2)There were 63 selling days for both the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
Total Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $440 million, or 11.2%, to $4,373 million, compared to $3,933 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, constant currency Net sales growth was 11.4%.
See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations" below for additional information regarding constant currency Net sales growth.
For the three months ended September 30, 2018, Net sales growth reflected balanced growth across transactions and solutions.
Transactional growth was primarily driven by client devices.
Solutions growth was driven primarily by software, servers, networking and enterprise storage.
Corporate segment Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $154 million, or 9.9%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017.
Growth was primarily driven by client device refresh.
Small Business segment Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased by $35 million, or 11.3%, between periods.
Sales growth was primarily driven by solutions growth, including software.
Public segment Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $181 million, or 10.7%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017.
The increase was primarily driven by double digit growth in Education, as well as Government and Healthcare both contributing high single-digit growth to the overall performance for the period.
Net sales in Education increased 14.7%, primarily driven by notebook and netcomm performance within K-12 as customers addressed their client device and networking needs.
Net sales to Government customers increased 8.0%, primarily driven by State & Local success in executing against contracts and continued success in meeting public safety needs.
Healthcare Net sales increased as customers moved forward with network refresh and data center projects.
Net sales in Other, which is comprised of results from our UK and Canadian operations, for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $71 million, or 18.5%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017.
Both operations grew in local currency and continued to take share in their respective local markets.
In addition, UK growth was driven in part by referral business for US-based customers.
The impact of foreign currency exchange decreased Other sales growth by approximately 200 basis points, due primarily to the unfavorable impact resulting from the Canadian dollar to US dollar translation.

Gross profit



Gross profit increased $72 million, or 11.1%, to $714 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $642 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit margin remained flat versus prior year at 16.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2018.
This was offset by year-over-year Net sales growth out-pacing the year-over-year growth rate in partner funding.
Selling and administrative expenses



Selling and administrative expenses increased $39 million, or 11.0%, to $391 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $352 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
The increase was driven by higher sales payroll costs, including sales commissions consistent with higher Gross profit dollars, higher coworker costs driven by attainment for performance-based compensation and strategic investments funded by tax reform.
Total coworker count was 8,937, up 215 from 8,722 at September 30, 2017.
Total coworker count was 8,726 at December 31, 2017.
As a percentage of total Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses remained flat at 8.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2018.

Income from operations by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of Net sales, and the year-over-year percentage change are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



* Not meaningful



(1)Amounts for 2017 have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of Topic 606.
(3)Includes the financial results for our other operating segments, CDW UK and CDW Canada, which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds.

Income from operations increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher sales payroll expenses and higher coworker costs due to higher attainment for performance-based compensation.
Total operating margin percentage increased 10 basis points to 6.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2018, from 6.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
Corporate segment income from operations was $127 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, an increase of $5 million, or 4.1%, compared to $122 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
Corporate segment income from operations increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher sales payroll expenses and coworker costs due to higher attainment for performance-based compensation.
Corporate segment operating margin percentage decreased 30 basis points to 7.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2018, from 7.8% for the three months ended September 30,

Other income from operations was $19 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, an increase of $5 million, or 34.5%, compared to $14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
Other income from operations increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher payroll expenses.
Other operating margin percentage increased 50 basis points to 4.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2018, from 3.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2017.
Income tax expense



Income tax expense was $55 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $78 million for the same period of the prior year.
The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily attributable to the reduction in the US federal statutory rate and higher excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation, partially offset by higher effective net state income tax rates primarily due to the reduced US federal benefit.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations



We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 below.
EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization.
Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items, which are described in the tables below.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net sales.
Consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as consolidated Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.
Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business.
Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure in the credit agreement governing our Term Loan used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments.
For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Note 6 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

The cash conversion cycle decreased to 18 days at September 30, 2018 compared to 19 days at September 30, 2017 as DSO and DPO each increased 1 day and DIO decreased 1 day compared to September 30, 2017.
Both DSO and DPO are impacted by third party services such as software as a service and warranties.
These sales have an unfavorable impact on DSO as the receivable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the Consolidated Statement of Operations is recorded on a net basis.
Investing Activities



Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period of the prior year.
Capital expenditures were $53 million and $59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to the timing of investments for improvements to our information technology systems.
Financing Activities



Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $112 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period of the prior year.
The decrease was primarily driven by fewer share repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, which resulted in a $301 million decrease in cash used in financing activities.
The decrease in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by reduced borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, which resulted in net cash outflows of $185 million.
