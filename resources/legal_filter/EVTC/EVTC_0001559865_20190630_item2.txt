EVERTEC is a leading full-service transaction processing business in Latin America and the Caribbean, providing a broad range of merchant acquiring, payment services and business process management services. According to the August 2018 Nilson Report, we are one of the largest merchant acquirers in Latin America based on total number of transactions and we believe we are the largest merchant acquirer in the Caribbean and Central America. We serve 26 countries in the region from our base in Puerto Rico. We manage a system of electronic payment networks that process more than two billion transactions annually, and offer a comprehensive suite of services for core bank processing and cash processing in Puerto Rico and technology outsourcing in all the regions we serve. In addition, we own and operate the ATH network, one of the leading debit networks in Latin America. We serve a diversified customer base of leading financial institutions, merchants, corporations and government agencies with “mission-critical” technology solutions that enable them to issue, process and accept transactions securely. We believe our business is well-positioned to continue to expand across the fast-growing Latin American region.

EVERTEC, Inc. ("EVERTEC", formerly known as Carib Latam Holdings, Inc.) is a Puerto Rico corporation organized in April 2012. Our main operating subsidiary, EVERTEC Group, LLC (formerly known as EVERTEC, LLC and EVERTEC, Inc., hereinafter “EVERTEC Group”), was organized in Puerto Rico in 1988. EVERTEC Group was formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Popular. On September 30, 2010, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), AP Carib Holdings, Ltd. (“Apollo”), an affiliate of Apollo Global Management LLC, acquired a 51% indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC Group as part of a merger (the “Merger”) and EVERTEC Group became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings. 
On April 17, 2012, EVERTEC Group was converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company (the “Conversion”) for the purpose of improving its consolidated tax efficiency by taking advantage of changes to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “PR Code”), that permit limited liability companies to be treated as partnerships that are pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes. Concurrent with the Conversion, Holdings, which is our direct subsidiary, was also converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company. Prior to these conversions, EVERTEC, Inc. was formed in order to act as the new parent company of Holdings and its subsidiaries, including EVERTEC Group. The transactions described above in this paragraph are collectively referred to as the “Reorganization.” 
Prior to the Merger on September 30, 2010, EVERTEC Group was 100% owned by Popular, the largest financial institution in the Caribbean, and operated substantially as an independent entity within Popular. After the consummation of the Merger, Popular retained an indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC Group and is our largest customer. In connection with, and upon consummation of the Merger, EVERTEC Group entered into a 15-year Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”), and several related agreements with Popular. Under the terms of the MSA, Popular agreed to continue to use EVERTEC services on an ongoing and exclusive basis, for the duration of the agreement, on commercial terms consistent with those of our historical relationship. The anticipated negotiation of the MSA extension may result in Popular obtaining significant concessions from us with respect to pricing and other key terms, both in respect of the current term and any extension of the MSA, particularly as we approach 2025. Additionally, Popular granted us a right of first refusal on the development of certain new financial technology products and services for the duration of the MSA.
The ongoing migration from cash and paper methods of payment to electronic payments continues to benefit the transaction-processing industry globally. We believe that the penetration of electronic payments in the markets in which we operate is significantly lower relative to the U.S. market, and that this ongoing shift will continue to generate substantial growth opportunities for our business. For example, currently the adoption of banking products, including electronic payments, in the Latin American and Caribbean regions is lower relative to the mature U.S. and European markets. We believe that the unbanked and underbanked population in our markets will continue to shrink, and therefore drive incremental penetration and growth of electronic payments in Puerto Rico and other Latin American regions. We also benefit from the trend for financial institutions and government agencies to outsource technology systems and processes. Many medium- and small-size institutions in the Latin American markets in which we operate have outdated computer systems and updating these IT legacy systems is financially and logistically challenging, which presents a business opportunity for us. 
On June 30, 2016, the U.S. President signed into law PROMESA. PROMESA establishes a fiscal oversight and the Oversight Board comprised of seven voting members appointed by the President. The Oversight Board has broad budgetary and financial powers over Puerto Rico’s budget, laws, financial plans and regulations, including the power to approve restructuring agreements with creditors, file petitions for restructuring and reform the electronic system for the tax collection. The Oversight Board will have ultimate authority in preparing the Puerto Rico government’s budget and any issuance of future debt by the government and its instrumentalities. In addition, PROMESA imposes an automatic stay on all litigation against Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, as well as any other judicial or administrative actions or proceedings to enforce or collect claims against the Puerto Rico government. On May 1, 2017, the automatic stay expired. Promptly after the expiration of the stay, creditors of the Puerto Rico government filed various lawsuits involving defaults on more than $70 billion of bonds issued by Puerto Rico, having failed to reach a negotiated settlement on such defaults with the Puerto Rico government during the period of the automatic stay. On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board filed a voluntary petition of relief on behalf of the Commonwealth pursuant to Title III of PROMESA for the restructuring of the Commonwealth’s debt. Subsequently, the Oversight Board filed voluntary petitions of relief pursuant to Title III of PROMESA on behalf certain public corporations and instrumentalities. Title III is an in-court debt restructuring proceeding similar to protections afforded debtors under Chapter 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”); the Bankruptcy Code is not available to the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities.
As the solution to the Puerto Rican government’s debt crisis remains unclear, we continue to carefully monitor our receivables with the government as well as monitor general economic trends to understand the impact the crisis has on the economy of Puerto Rico and our card payment volumes. To date our receivables with the Puerto Rican government and overall payment transaction volumes have not been significantly affected by the debt crisis, however we remain cautious.
Total revenues in the second quarter of 2019 increased by $9.2 million or 8% to $122.5 million when compared with the prior year period. Revenue increase in the quarter was primarily driven by increased volumes from ATH debit network and benefits from value added solutions coupled with other pricing actions. In addition, there was an increase in core banking transactions and an increase in network services related to new managed services projects. The quarter also benefited from revenue of approximately $2.5 million from completed special projects and hardware sales. 
Cost of revenues amounted to $52.6 million, an increase of $3.5 million or 7% when compared with the prior year period. The increase is primarily related to cost of sales associated with the increased hardware sales, coupled with higher professional fees and increased provisions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in salaries and compensation mainly driven by deferred salaries in connection with software developments. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2019 decreased by $2.8 million or 16% when compared with the same quarter in 2018. The decrease is primarily related to lower professional fees as the prior year included fees in connection with due diligence for a potential transaction that the Company decided not to pursue.
Non-operating expenses increased by $0.7 million to $8.1 million when compared with the prior year period. The increase is mainly related to a $1.0 million decrease in Other income, net due to higher foreign exchange losses relative to the same quarter in 2018.
Income tax expense amounted to $2.5 million, a decrease of $0.6 million when compared with the prior year quarterly period. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 8.4%, compared with 13.4% in the 2018 period. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily related to the tax benefit generated in connection with stock based compensation of $1.0 million coupled with a shift in taxable income composition in Puerto Rico. 
Total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2019 amounted to $241.4 million, an increase of $17.8 million or 8%. Revenue increase in the first half of 2019 reflected growth from elevated sales volumes in Puerto Rico, higher core banking transactions and an increase in fees generated by network services related to new managed services projects. Additionally, revenue growth was impacted by one-time revenue related to an electronic benefits contract of approximately $2.7 million and revenue from hardware sales and the completion of several projects of approximately $2.5 million. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased by $1.1 million or 3% to $30.2 million when compared with the same period in 2018. The decrease is mainly driven by lower professional services as explained above for the quarter.
Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $33.5 million, an increase of $1.9 million when compared with the prior year. The increase is due to the same reasons explained above for the quarter.
Non-operating expenses increased by $1.0 million to $14.9 million when compared with the prior year period. The increase is almost entirely related to a decrease in Other income, net of $1.6 million due to an increase in foreign exchange losses.
Income tax expense amounted to $6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $0.7 million when compared with the prior year period and an effective tax rate of 10.5% compared with 14.0% in the prior year. The decrease in the effective tax rate is driven by the impact of the tax benefit generated from stock based compensation of $1.0 million and the shift in taxable income in Puerto Rico.
The Merchant Acquiring segment consists of revenues from services that allow merchants to accept electronic methods of payment. In the Merchant Acquiring segment, revenues include a discount fee and membership fees charged to merchants, debit network fees and rental fees from POS devices and other equipment, net of credit card interchange and assessment fees charged by credit cards associations (such as VISA or MasterCard) or payment networks. The discount fee is generally a percentage of the transaction value. EVERTEC also charges merchants for other services that are unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value.
The Business Solutions segment consists of revenues from a full suite of business process management solutions in various product areas such as core bank processing, network hosting and management, IT professional services, business process outsourcing, item processing, cash processing, and fulfillment. Core bank processing and network services revenues are derived in part from a recurrent fee and from fees based on the number of accounts on file (i.e. savings or checking accounts, loans, etc.) or computer resources utilized. Revenues from other processing services within the Business Solutions segment are generally volume-based and depend on factors such as the number of accounts processed. In addition, EVERTEC is a reseller of hardware and software products and these resale transactions are generally one-time transactions.
In addition to the four operating segments described above, Management identified certain functional cost areas that operate independently and do not constitute businesses in themselves. These units could neither be concluded as operating segments nor could they be combined with any other operating segments. Therefore, these units are aggregated and presented as 
The CODM reviews the operating segments separate financial information to assess performance and to allocate resources. Management evaluates the operating results of each of its operating segments based upon revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to operating segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, "Segment Reporting" given that it is reported to the CODM for purposes of allocating resources. Segment asset disclosure is not used by the CODM as a measure of segment performance since the segment evaluation is driven by revenues and adjusted EBITDA performance. As such, segment assets are not disclosed in the notes to the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements.
The following tables set forth information about the Company’s operations by its four business segments for the periods indicated below. 
Business Solutions segment revenue increased $6.0 million to $55.2 million. The increase was mainly related to higher hardware and software sales coupled with revenue from new services provided to Popular and the Government of Puerto Rico. Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.1 million to $24.3 million when compared with the prior year as a result of the higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of sales and operating expenses.
Merchant acquiring revenues increased $3.4 million to $52.8 million when compared with the prior year period, driven by the same reasons above explained for the quarter coupled with electronic benefit disaster relief recovery funding that ended in March 2019. Increases in transactional fees contributed to higher net spreads versus the same period in the previous year, while higher non-transactional fees also helped to drive the year-over-year revenue increase. Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.7 million reflecting the increased revenues, partially offset by higher transaction processing charges and a lower average ticket.
Our principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, and our primary liquidity requirements are the funding of capital expenditures, working capital needs and acquisitions. We also have a $125.0 million Revolving Facility, of which $116.9 million was available as of June 30, 2019. The Company issues letters of credit against our Revolving Facility which reduce our availability of funds to be drawn.
At June 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $64.0 million, of which $50.1 million resides in our subsidiaries located outside of Puerto Rico for purposes of (i) funding the respective subsidiary’s current business operations and (ii) funding potential future investment outside of Puerto Rico. We intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of Puerto Rico, and based on our liquidity forecast, we will not need to repatriate this cash to fund the Puerto Rico operations or to meet debt-service obligations. However, if in the future we determine that we no longer need to maintain cash balances within our foreign subsidiaries, we may elect to distribute such cash to the Company in Puerto Rico. Distributions from the foreign subsidiaries to Puerto Rico may be subject to tax withholding and other tax consequences. Additionally, our credit agreement imposes certain restrictions on the distribution of dividends from subsidiaries.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $76.0 million compared with cash provided by operating activities of $76.9 million for the corresponding 2018 period. The $0.9 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by more cash used to pay down accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and income taxes, partially offset by higher net income. 
Our principal capital expenditures are for hardware and computer software (purchased and internally developed) and additions to property and equipment. We invested approximately $35.6 million and $15.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our Revolving Facility. We expect capital expenditures to be in a range of $50 million to $55 million in 2019.
On February 15, 2019 and April 25, 2019, the Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share on the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, which was paid on March 22, 2019 and June 7, 2019, respectively, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 26, 2019 and May 6, 2019, respectively. 
The unpaid principal balance at June 30, 2019 of the 2023 Term A Loan and the 2024 Term B Loan was $214.5 million and $323.4 million, respectively. The additional borrowing capacity for the Revolving Facility at June 30, 2019 was $116.9 million. 
The Company issues letters of credit against the Revolving Facility which reduce the additional borrowing capacity of the Revolving Facility.
In May 2016, EVERTEC Group entered into a non-interest bearing financing agreement amounting to $0.7 million to purchase software. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the outstanding principal balance of the note payable was $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The current portion of this note is recorded as part of accounts payable and the long-term portion is included in other long-term liabilities.
In January 2019, EVERTEC Group entered into a non-interest bearing financing agreement amounting to $10.0 million to purchase data processing equipment and maintenance. As of June 30, 2019, the outstanding principal balance of the note payable was $5.0 million, recorded as part of accounts payable.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company reclassified gains of $0.5 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss into income through interest expense. Based on current LIBOR rates, the Company expects to reclassify gains of $0.2 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss into income through interest expense over the next 12 months. Refer to Note 6 for tabular disclosure of the fair value of derivatives and to Note 7 for tabular disclosure of losses recorded on cash flow hedging activities.
The cash flow hedge is considered highly effective.
As of June 30, 2019, the secured leverage ratio was 2.17 to 1.00. As of the date of filing of this Form 10-Q, no event has occurred that constitutes an Event of Default or Default.
We define “EBITDA” as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments described below. Adjusted EBITDA by segment is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K. We define “Adjusted Net Income” as net income adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments described below. We define “Adjusted Earnings per common share” as Adjusted Net Income divided by diluted shares outstanding. 
•other companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings per common share or may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share differently than as presented in this Report, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share are not measurements of liquidity or financial performance under GAAP. You should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with GAAP.
