Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Interest rate risks
We issued floating-rate debt which is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Our secured credit facilities accrue interest at variable rates and only the 2024 Term B is subject to a floor or a minimum rate. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates over our floor(s) on our debt balances outstanding as of September 30, 2019, under the secured credit facilities, would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $3.3 million. The impact on future interest expense as a result of future changes in interest rates will depend largely on the gross amount of our borrowings at that time.
See Note 5 of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the senior secured credit facilities.
