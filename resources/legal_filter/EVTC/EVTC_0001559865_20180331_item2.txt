EVERTEC is a leading full-service transaction processing business in Latin America and the Caribbean, providing a broad range of merchant acquiring, payment services and business process management services. According to the August 2017 Nilson Report, we are one of the largest merchant acquirers in Latin America based on total number of transactions and we believe we are the largest merchant acquirer in the Caribbean and Central America. We serve 26 countries in the region from our base in Puerto Rico. We manage a system of electronic payment networks that process more than two billion transactions annually, and offer a comprehensive suite of services for core bank processing, cash processing and technology outsourcing. In addition, we own and operate the ATH network, one of the leading personal identification number (“PIN”) debit networks in Latin America. We serve a diversified customer base of leading financial institutions, merchants, corporations and government agencies with “mission-critical” technology solutions that enable them to issue, process and accept transactions securely. We believe our business is well-positioned to continue to expand across the fast-growing Latin American region.
•Our ability to provide in one package a range of services that traditionally had to be sourced from different vendors; 
•Our ability to serve customers with disparate operations in several geographies with integrated technology solutions that enable them to manage their business as one enterprise; and 
•Our ability to capture and analyze data across the transaction processing value chain and use that data to provide value-added services that are differentiated from those offered by pure-play vendors that serve only one portion of the transaction processing value chain (such as only merchant acquiring or payment services). 
We sell and distribute our services primarily through a proprietary direct sales force with established customer relationships. We are also building a variety of indirect sales channels that enable us to leverage the distribution capabilities of partners in adjacent markets, including value-added resellers. We continue to pursue joint ventures and merchant acquiring alliances. 
EVERTEC, Inc. (formerly known as Carib Latam Holdings, Inc.) is a Puerto Rico corporation organized in April 2012. Our main operating subsidiary, EVERTEC Group, LLC (formerly known as EVERTEC, LLC and EVERTEC, Inc., hereinafter “EVERTEC Group”), was organized in Puerto Rico in 1988. EVERTEC Group was formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Popular. On September 30, 2010, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), AP Carib Holdings, Ltd. (“Apollo”), an affiliate of Apollo Global Management LLC, acquired a 51% indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC Group as part of a merger (the “Merger”) and EVERTEC Group became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings. 
On April 17, 2012, EVERTEC Group was converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company (the “Conversion”) for the purpose of improving its consolidated tax efficiency by taking advantage of changes to the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “PR Code”), that permit limited liability companies to be treated as partnerships that are pass-through entities for Puerto Rico tax purposes. Concurrent with the Conversion, Holdings, which is our direct subsidiary, was also converted from a Puerto Rico corporation to a Puerto Rico limited liability company. Prior to these conversions, EVERTEC, Inc. was formed in order to act as the new parent company of Holdings and its subsidiaries, including EVERTEC Group. The transactions described above in this paragraph are collectively referred to as the “Reorganization.” 
Prior to the Merger on September 30, 2010, EVERTEC Group was 100% owned by Popular, the largest financial institution in the Caribbean, and operated substantially as an independent entity within Popular. After the consummation of the Merger, Popular retained an indirect ownership interest in EVERTEC Group and is our largest customer. In connection with, and upon consummation of the Merger, EVERTEC Group entered into a 15-year Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”), and several related agreements with Popular. Under the terms of the MSA, Popular agreed to continue to use EVERTEC services on an ongoing and exclusive basis, for the duration of the agreement, on commercial terms consistent with those of our historical relationship. Additionally, Popular granted us a right of first refusal on the development of certain new financial technology products and services for the duration of the MSA.
The ongoing migration from cash and paper methods of payment to electronic payments continues to benefit the transaction- processing industry globally. We believe that the penetration of electronic payments in the markets in which we operate is significantly lower relative to the U.S. market, and that this ongoing shift will continue to generate substantial growth opportunities for our business. For example, currently the adoption of banking products, including electronic payments, in the Latin American and Caribbean region is lower relative to the mature U.S. and European markets. We believe that the unbanked and underbanked population in our markets will continue to shrink, and therefore drive incremental penetration and growth of electronic payments in Puerto Rico and other Latin American regions. We also benefit from the trend for financial institutions and government agencies to outsource technology systems and processes. Many medium- and small-size institutions in the Latin American markets in which we operate have outdated computer systems and updating these IT legacy systems is financially and logistically challenging, which presents a business opportunity for us. 
On June 30, 2016, the U.S. President signed into law PROMESA. PROMESA establishes a fiscal oversight and the Oversight Board comprised of seven voting members appointed by the President. The Oversight Board has broad budgetary and financial powers over Puerto Rico’s budget, laws, financial plans and regulations, including the power to approve restructuring 
agreements with creditors, file petitions for restructuring and reform the electronic system for the tax collection. The Oversight Board will have ultimate authority in preparing the Puerto Rico government’s budget and any issuance of future debt by the government and its instrumentalities. In addition, PROMESA imposes an automatic stay on all litigation against Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, as well as any other judicial or administrative actions or proceedings to enforce or collect claims against the Puerto Rico government. On May 1, 2017, the automatic stay expired. Promptly after the expiration of the stay, creditors of the Puerto Rico government filed various lawsuits involving defaults on more than $70 billion of bonds issued by Puerto Rico, having failed to reach a negotiated settlement on such defaults with the Puerto Rico government during the period of the automatic stay. On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board filed a voluntary petition of relief on behalf of the Commonwealth pursuant to Title III of PROMESA for the restructuring of the Commonwealth’s debt. Subsequently, the Oversight Board filed voluntary petitions of relief pursuant to Title III of PROMESA on behalf certain public corporations and instrumentalities. Title III is an in-court debt restructuring proceeding similar to protections afforded debtors under Chapter 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”); the Bankruptcy Code is not available to the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities.
As the solution to the Puerto Rican government’s debt crisis remains unclear, we continue to carefully monitor our receivables with the government as well as monitor general economic trends to understand the impact the crisis has on the economy of Puerto Rico and our card payment volumes. To date our receivables with the Puerto Rican government and overall payment transaction volumes have not been significantly affected by the debt crisis, however we remain cautious. 
Revenues
Cost of revenues 
Cost of revenues amounted to $47.4 million an increase of $3.2 million or 7% when compared with the prior year period. The increase is primarily driven by an increase in salaries and benefits in connection with the PayGroup acquisition.
Selling, general and administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2018 increased by $2.6 million or 24% to $13.4 million when compared with the first quarter of 2017. The increase is mainly driven by an increase in share based compensation expense coupled with expenses related to the PayGroup acquisition.
Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $15.9 million , relatively flat when compared with the prior year.
Non-operating expenses increased by $1.1 million to $6.5 million when compared with the prior year period. The increase is mainly related to an increase in interest expense of $0.6 million coupled with a $0.5 million decrease in Other income, net due to a decrease in foreign exchange gains.
Income tax expense amounted to $3.9 million an increase of $1.9 million when compared with the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the quarter of 13.8% included a discreet tax expense item of approximately $0.5 million that contributed to an increase in the rate.
Segment Results of Operations
The Payment Services - Latin America segment revenues consist of revenues related to providing access to the ATH debit network and other card networks to financial institutions, including related services such as authorization, processing, management and recording of ATM and POS transactions, and ATM management and monitoring. The segment revenues also include revenues from card processing services (such as credit and debit card processing, authorization and settlement and fraud monitoring and control to debit or credit issuers), payment processing services (such as payment and billing products for merchants, businesses and financial institutions), as well as, licensed software solutions for risk and fraud management and card payment processing. For ATH debit network and processing services, revenues are primarily driven by the number of transactions processed. Revenues are derived primarily from network fees, transaction switching and processing fees, and the leasing POS devices. For card issuer processing, revenues are primarily dependent upon the number of cardholder accounts on file, transactions and authorizations processed, the number of cards embossed and other processing services. 
The Merchant Acquiring segment consists of revenues from services that allow merchants to accept electronic methods of payment. In the Merchant Acquiring segment, revenues include a discount fee and membership fees charged to merchants, debit network fees and rental fees from POS devices and other equipment, net of credit card interchange and assessment fees charged by credit cards associations (such as VISA or MasterCard) or payment networks. The discount fee is generally a percentage of the transaction value. EVERTEC also charges merchants for other services that are unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value.
The Business Solutions segment consists of revenues from a full suite of business process management solutions in various product areas such as core bank processing, network hosting and management, IT professional services, business process outsourcing, item processing, cash processing, and fulfillment. Core bank processing and network services revenues are derived in part from a recurrent fee and from fees based on the number of accounts on file (i.e. savings or checking accounts, loans, etc.) or computer resources utilized. Revenues from other processing services within the Business Solutions segment are generally volume-based and depend on factors such as the number of accounts processed. In addition, EVERTEC is a reseller of hardware and software products and these resale transactions are generally one-time transactions.

The CODM reviews the operating segments separate financial information to assess performance and to allocate resources. Management evaluates the operating results of each of its operating segments based upon revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to operating segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, "Segment Reporting" given that it is reported to the CODM for purposes of allocating resources. Segment asset disclosure is not used by the CODM as a measure of segment performance since the segment evaluation is driven by revenues and adjusted EBITDA performance. As such, segment assets are not disclosed in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The following tables set forth information about the Company’s operations by its four business segments for the periods indicated below. 
Payment Services - Latin America
Payment services - Latin America revenue increased $7.4 million to $20.4 million driven by added revenues in connection with PayGroup acquisition coupled with increased revenues from transaction processing. Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.5 million when compared to the prior year period reflecting the increased revenue from the PayGroup acquisition at a lower margin.
Business Solutions
Our principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, and our primary liquidity requirements are the funding of capital expenditures, working capital needs and acquisitions. We also have a $100.0 million Revolving Facility, of which $100.0 million was available as of March 31, 2018.
At March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $53.5 million, of which $32.5 million resides in our subsidiaries located outside of Puerto Rico for purposes of (i) funding the respective subsidiary’s current business operations and 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $30.4 million compared with cash provided by operating activities of $25.3 million for the corresponding 2017 period. The $5.1 million increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by less cash used to pay down accounts payable and accrued liabilities, less cash used to prepay maintenance contracts and less cash used to pay income taxes, these positive variances were partially offset by less cash received from accounts receivable.
Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $9.4 million compared with $6.5 million for the corresponding period in 2017. The $2.8 million increase reflects an increase in capital expenditures when compared to the prior year. 
Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $17.4 million as compared with $18.5 million for the corresponding 2017 period. Cash used in financing activities was primarily related cash used for repayments of the revolving credit facility and principal repayments on long-term debt. 
Our principal capital expenditures are for hardware and computer software (purchased and internally developed) and additions to property and equipment. We invested approximately $9.4 million and $6.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our Revolving Facility. We expect capital expenditures to be in a range of $35 million to $40 million in 2018.
On April 17, 2018, the Company paid the outstanding balance of the 2018 Term A Loan which amounted to $26.1 million, as scheduled. In addition, on the same date, $35 million of the Revolving Facility expired. As of April 17, 2018, the total borrowing capacity of the Revolving Facility is $65 million.
Dividend Payments
Financial Obligations
On April 17, 2013, EVERTEC Group entered into a credit agreement (the “2013 Credit Agreement”) governing the senior secured credit facilities, consisting of a $300.0 million term loan A facility (the “Term A Loan”), a $400.0 million term loan B facility (the “Term B Loan”, together with the Term A Loan, the “Senior Secured term loans”) and a $100.0 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility"). During 2016, the Company entered into two separate amendments to the 2013 Credit Agreement. In the second quarter of 2016, EVERTEC Group, together with certain other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a second amendment and waiver to the outstanding 2013 Credit Agreement (the “Second Amendment”). In the fourth quarter of 2016, EVERTEC Group, together with certain other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a third amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the 2013 Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment extends the maturity of (a) approximately $219 million of EVERTEC Group’s existing approximately $250 million of Term A loan facility to January 17, 2020 (the “2020 Term A Loan”) and (b) $65 million of EVERTEC Group’s existing $100 million of Revolving Facility to January 17, 2020. The remaining approximately $30 million of Term A loan (the “2018 Term A Loan”) and the $35 million of Revolving Facility that were not extended will remain in place and mature as originally scheduled on April 17, 2018. The Term B Loan will remain in place and mature as originally scheduled on April 17, 2020. All loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty.
The unpaid principal balance at March 31, 2018 of the 2018 Term A Loan, the 2020 Term A Loan and the Term B Loan was $26.1 million, $199.6 million and $381.0 million, respectively. The additional borrowing capacity for the Revolving Facility at March 31, 2018 was $100.0 million. On April 17, 2018, the Company paid the outstanding principal balance of the 2018 Term A loan which matured as scheduled. In addition, $35 million of the Revolving Facility expired on the same date, our borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility is $65 million.
In May 2016, EVERTEC Group entered into a non-interest bearing financing agreement amounting to $0.7 million and in October 2016 entered into an interest bearing agreement of $1.1 million, to purchase software. As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal balance of the notes payable is $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The current portion of these notes is recorded as part of accounts payable and the long-term portion is included in other long-term liabilities.
Interest Rate Swap
The Company has accounted for this transaction as a cash flow hedge. The fair value of the Company’s derivative instrument is determined using a standard valuation model. The significant inputs used in this model are readily available in public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and therefore have been classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Inputs used in this standard valuation model for derivative instruments include the applicable forward rates and discount rates. The discount rates are based on the historical LIBOR Swap rates. 
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reclassified losses of $0.2 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss into income through interest expense. Based on current LIBOR rates, the Company expects to reclassify $0.2 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss into income through interest expense over the next 12 months.
The cash flow hedge is considered highly effective and no impact on earnings is expected due to hedge ineffectiveness.
Net Income Reconciliation to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share (Non-GAAP Measures)
We define “EBITDA” as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments described below. Adjusted EBITDA by segment is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K. We define “Adjusted Net Income” as net income adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments described below. We define “Adjusted Earnings per common share” as Adjusted Net Income divided by diluted shares outstanding. 
•they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital;
•although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements;
•in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest, or principal payments, on indebtedness;
•other companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings per common share or may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share differently than as presented in this Report, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share are not measurements of liquidity or financial performance under GAAP. You should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities or any other performance 
measures determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of cash flows, as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with GAAP.
