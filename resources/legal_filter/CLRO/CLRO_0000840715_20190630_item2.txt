ClearOne is a global Company that designs, develops and sells conferencing, collaboration, and AV networking solutions for voice and visual communications. The performance and simplicity of our advanced, comprehensive solutions offer a high level of functionality, reliability and scalability. We derive a major portion of our revenue from audio conferencing products and microphones by promoting our products in the professional audio-visual channel. We have extended our total addressable market from the installed audio conferencing market to adjacent complementary markets – microphones, video collaboration and AV networking. We have achieved this through strategic technological acquisitions as well as by internal product development. 
We also introduced COLLABORATE® Space to our growing family of collaboration solutions. It’s a suite that unifies messaging, calls and meetings and will energize workflows and increase productivity for everyone involved in the enterprise. Designed as a persistent, user-friendly collaboration suite, COLLABORATE Space contains many powerful UCC capabilities, as well as the seamless ability to make calls outside the network.  
During the first six months of 2019, we continued our serious litigation efforts to stop infringement of our strategic patents. We also continued our programs to cut costs and to speed up product development that we believe will enable us to get back to a growth path. 
Overall revenue declined in the second quarter of 2019 when compared to the second quarter of 2018, with declines seen in all product categories except video. We believe the on-going infringement of ClearOne’s patents is the major cause of our revenue decline in the audio conferencing and microphones categories. Our gross profit margin decreased marginally to 46% during the second quarter of 2019 from 47% for the second quarter of 2018. Net loss decreased marginally from $2.2 million in the second quarter of 2018 to $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2019. The decrease in net loss in 2019 was primarily due to reduced operating expenses offset by reduced gross profit and tax benefit.  
Overall revenue declined in the first six months of 2019 when compared to same period in 2018, with declines seen in all product categories, except video. We believe the on-going infringement of ClearOne’s patents is the major cause of our revenue decline in the audio conferencing and microphones categories. We are inappropriately being forced to compete against our own patented technology. We believe the revenue decline in video products was caused partially by increased competition in the space as well as due to reduced attention from our partners caused by the alternatives made available through infringement of our patents. Our gross profit margin decreased to 44% during the first six months of 2019 from 52% during the same six months in 2018. Gross profit margin decreased primarily due to increased material costs and reduction of higher margin professional audio conferencing products in the revenue mix. Net loss during the first six months of 2019 increased to $4.4 million from $4.0 million during the same period in 2018. The increase in net loss in 2019 was primarily due to reduced tax benefit and gross profit partially offset by reduced operating expenses. 
We operate in a very dynamic and highly competitive industry which is dominated on the one hand by a few players with respect to certain products like traditional video conferencing appliances while on the other influenced heavily by a fragmented reseller market consisting of numerous regional and local players. The industry is also characterized by venture capitalist funded start-ups and private companies willing to fund cumulative cash losses in order to gain market share and achieve certain non-financial goals. 
The audio-visual products market is characterized by intense competition and rapidly evolving technology. Our competitors vary within each product category. Our installed professional audio conferencing products, which is our flagship product category, continue to be ahead of the competition despite the reduction in revenues. Our strength in this space is largely due to our fully integrated suite of products consisting of DSP mixers, wide range of professional microphone products and video collaboration products. Despite our strong leadership position in the installed professional audio conferencing market, we face challenges to revenue growth due to the limited size of the market and pricing pressures from new competitors attracted to the commercial market due to higher margins. 
Revenue from our video products are critical to our long-term growth. We face intense competition in this market from well-established market leaders as well as emerging players rich with marketing funds. We expect our strategy of combining Spontania, our cloud-based video conferencing product, Collaborate, our appliance-based media collaboration product, our high-quality professional cameras, and our high-end audio conferencing technology will generate high growth in the near future. We believe we are also well positioned to capitalize on the continuing migration away from the traditional hardware-based video conferencing systems to software-based video conferencing applications. 
We derive a major portion of our revenue (approximately 47% for the year ended December 31, 2018) from international operations and expect this trend to continue in the future. Most of our revenue from outside the U.S. is billed in U.S. dollars and is not exposed to any significant currency risk. However, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk if the U.S. dollar is strong against other currencies as it will make U.S. Dollar denominated prices of our products less competitive. 
A detailed discussion of our results of operations follows below. 
Our revenue decreased to $6.4 million in 2019-Q2 compared to $7.0 million in 2018-Q2. The highest decline was seen in the audio conferencing category with a 20% decline followed by microphones with a marginal 1% decline. Revenue from video products grew by 16% on the back of growth in sales of videoconferencing appliances, cameras and cloud-based videoconferencing services. The decline in the audio conferencing category was due to a decline in all subcategories including professional installed audio conferencing, personal conferencing and tabletop conferencing. The decline in microphones category was due to a decline in beamforming microphones offset by increase in revenue from wireless mics. The on-going infringement of ClearOne’s patents is the major cause of our revenue decline in audio conferencing and microphones categories. The share of audio conferencing products in our product mix decreased from 52% in 2018-Q2 to 45% in 2019-Q2. The share of microphones increased from 32% to 35%. Share of video products in the revenue mix increased from 16% to 20%. During 2019-Q2 revenue declined in the USA, Canada, Australia, Japan, China and Northern Europe offset by revenue increases in the Middle East, India, South Asia, South Korea and Central Europe and Southern Europe. Asia Pacific, including the Middle East, increased by 6%, Europe and Africa declined by 8% and the Americas declined by 15%. 
Our revenue decreased to $12.7 million in 2019-H1 compared to $14.3 million in 2018-H1. The highest decline was seen in audio conferencing category with 23% decline followed by microphones with 5% decline. Revenue from video products grew by 14% on the back of growth in sales of videoconferencing appliances, cameras, cloud-based videoconferencing services and network media streaming products. The decline in audio conferencing category was due to a decline in all subcategories including professional installed audio conferencing, personal conferencing and tabletop conferencing. The decline in microphones category was due to a decline in beamforming microphones and ceiling microphones offset by increase in revenue from wireless mics. The on-going infringement of ClearOne’s patents is the major cause of our revenue decline in audio conferencing and microphones categories. The share of audio conferencing products in our product mix decreased from 51% in 2018-H1 to 44% in 2019-H1. The share of microphones increased from 32% to 34%. Share of video products in the revenue mix increased from 17% to 22%. During 2019-H1 revenue declined in all regions except the Middle East, India, South Asia and Central Europe and Southern Europe. The decline was more pronounced in Canada, Australia, Japan and Northern Europe. Asia Pacific, including the Middle East declined by 2%, Europe and Africa declined by 14% and Americas declined by 14%. 
We believe, although there can be no assurance, that we will return to a growth path if we are able to successfully implement our strategic initiatives focused on product innovation, cost reduction and defense of our intellectual property. 
Cost of goods sold includes expenses associated with finished goods purchased from outsourced manufacturers, the repackaging of our products, our manufacturing and operations organization, property and equipment depreciation, warranty expense, freight expense, royalty payments, and the allocation of overhead expenses. 
Our profitability in the near-term continues to depend significantly on our revenues from professional installed audio-conferencing products. We hold long-term inventory and if we are unable to sell our long-term inventory, our profitability might be affected by inventory write-offs and price mark-downs. Our long-term inventory includes approximately $2.0 million of wireless microphone-related finished goods and assemblies, $1.6 million of Converge Pro 2 products and about $1.7 million of raw materials that will be used for manufacturing professional audio conferencing products. Any business changes that are adverse to these product lines could potentially impact our ability to sell these long-term inventory in addition to our current inventory. 
Other income (expense), net, includes interest income, interest expense, and foreign currency changes. It remained almost the same in 2019-Q2 and 2018-Q2. It increased marginally in 2019-H1 compared to 2018-H1. 
As of June 30, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $2.4 million compared to $11.2 million as of December 31, 2018. Our working capital was $20.4 million and $28.4 million as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 
We have been actively engaged in preserving cash by suspending our dividend program, allowing our share repurchase program to expire and implementing company-wide cost reduction measures. In addition, we expect to generate additional cash as our inventory levels are brought down to historical levels. We also believe that the measures taken by us will yield higher revenues in the future. We believe all of these and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to meet our short-term and long-term operating requirements and finance our growth plans. We also believe that our strong portfolio of intellectual property and our solid brand equity in the market will enable us to raise additional capital if and when needed to meet our short and long-term financing needs. In addition to capital expenditures, we may use cash in the near future for selective infusions of technology, sales and marketing, infrastructure, and other investments to fuel our growth. 
At June 30, 2019, we had open purchase orders of approximately $1.5 million, primarily related to inventory purchases. 
At June 30, 2019, we had inventory totaling $20.0 million, of which non-current inventory accounted for $7.7 million. This compares to total inventories of $22.2 million and non-current inventory of $9.0 million as of December 31, 2018.
