Sales were $140.3 million and $389.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $185.1 million and $540.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. Our gross margin decreased to 41.6% and 38.1% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, from 46.7% and 45.3% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. Our operating income margin decreased to (1.6)% and (10.7)% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, from 9.8% and 7.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. Net income (loss) was $7.6 million and $(10.9) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $15.9 million and $35.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. Our effective tax rate, excluding the effect of the bargain purchase gain in 2018, was a benefit of 135.7% and 52.2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to a provision of 17.2% and 23.1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. Earnings (loss) per share, assuming dilution, was $0.16 and $(0.23) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $0.33 and $0.72 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. 
We recognized a positive revenue impact in the first half of 2017 due to our being awarded a network expansion program by a large European Tier-1 customer. During 2018, this European Tier 1 customer undertook an additional network expansion project. We anticipate that as our Latin American customers resume their network upgrade projects, we may experience further enhancement to our revenues. As announced, we received of a new nationwide award in the APAC region, as well as additional awards based on new ADTRAN technologies in the EMEA region that have, and we believe will continue to have, a positive impact to our revenues. However, a resolution of the regulatory changes affecting a major customer in Mexico has been slower than anticipated, and business with one of our customers in that region has not yet returned to normal levels. We are continuing to pursue opportunities with new customers in this region. 
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 53.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2017 to 58.4% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, and increased from 54.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to 61.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, and services and support mix. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, and services and support mix, restructuring expenses and an increase in warranty replacements.  
Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, increased from 50.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2017 to 57.8% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, and increased from 51.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to 61.0% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift and customer and product mix. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, an increase in warranty expense due to a settlement in first quarter of 2017 with a third party supplier for a defective component and purchase discounts received from a contract manufacturer in the first quarter of 2017 and restructuring expenses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 11.3% from $34.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2017 to $30.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, and decreased 7.5% from $104.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to $96.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in compensation and labor expense, travel expense and independent contractor expense, partially offset by an increase in restructuring expense. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to a decrease in compensation and labor expense, independent contractor expense, and travel expense, partially offset by an increase in restructuring expense. 
As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 18.7% in the three months ended September 30, 2017 to 21.9% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, and increased from 19.3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to 24.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales may fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenues for the periods being compared. 
Research and development expenses decreased 11.0% from $33.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2017 to $29.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, and decreased 5.7% from $99.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to $93.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in labor, engineering materials and independent contractor expense. The decrease in research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in engineering materials and independent contractor expense and amortization of intangibles acquired in the third quarter of 2016 that were fully amortized in 2017, partially offset by an increase in restructuring expense. 
As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased from 18.1% in the three months ended September 30, 2017 to 21.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2018, and increased from 18.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to 24.0% in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there are incremental product development activities or significant fluctuations in revenues for the periods being compared. 
Interest and dividend income decreased 13.3% from $1.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2017 to $0.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, and decreased 8.9% from $2.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to $2.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The decrease in interest and dividend income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to fluctuations in investment balances and a decrease in the rate of return on those investments due to interest rate movements. 
Interest expense, which is primarily related to our taxable revenue bond, remained constant at $0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2018, and $0.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2018, as we had no substantial change in our fixed-rate borrowing. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information on our revenue bond. 
Net investment gains increased 346.7% from $1.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2017 to $4.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, and increased 88.2% from $2.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to $5.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in net investment gains for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to changes in fair value on equity securities recognized during the period under ASC 2016-01. Prior to January 1, 2018, changes in fair value were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, on the balance sheet. See Note 1, Note 7 and “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information. 
Other income (expense), net, comprised primarily of miscellaneous income, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts, investment account management fees, and scrap raw material sales. Other income, net increased 123.9% from $0.8 million of expense in the three months ended September 30, 2017 to $0.2 million of income in the three months ended September 30, 2018. Other income (expense), net decreased 94.9% from $1.4 million of expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to $0.1 million of expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The change in other income (expense), net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to higher losses on foreign exchange contracts and transactions in 2017. 
Gain on bargain purchase of a business is related to our acquisition of Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and entry into a technology license and supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. on March 19, 2018. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
As a result of the above factors, net income (loss) decreased $8.3 million from $15.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2017 to $7.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018, and decreased $45.8 million from $35.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to $(10.9) million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018.  
Liquidity 
At September 30, 2018, cash on hand was $94.2 million and short-term investments were $5.9 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $100.1 million, of which $70.1 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017, cash on hand was $86.4 million and short-term investments were $16.1 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $102.6 million, of which $56.8 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We intend to permanently reinvest the funds held by our foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S. and our current business plans do not indicate a need to repatriate these funds to finance domestic operations. The decrease in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2017 to September 30, 2018 is primarily attributable to shifts among available investment option tenures to provide funds for our short-term cash needs. 
Operating Activities 
Our working capital, which consists of current assets less current liabilities, decreased 26.5% from $306.3 million as of December 31, 2017 to $225.0 million as of September 30, 2018, and our current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, decreased from 3.87 as of December 31, 2017 to 2.82 as of September 30, 2018. The decreases in our working capital and current ratio are primarily attributable to decreases in accounts receivable and inventory, and an increase in income tax payable. The quick ratio, defined as cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and net accounts receivable, divided by current liabilities, decreased from 2.31 as of December 31, 2017 to 1.63 as of September 30, 2018. The decrease in the quick ratio is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in income tax payable.  
Accounts receivable decreased 29.3% from $144.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $101.9 million at September 30, 2018. We had no allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2017 or September 30, 2018. Quarterly accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased from 105 days as of December 31, 2017 to 67 days as of September 30, 2018. The decrease in net accounts receivable is due to the collection of customer-specific payment terms that became due in the first quarter of 2018 and the timing of sales and collections during the quarter. Additionally, certain international customers may have longer payment terms than U.S. customers.  
Quarterly inventory turnover increased from 2.28 turns as of December 31, 2017 to 2.89 turns at September 30, 2018. Inventory decreased 13.5% from $122.5 million at December 31, 2017 to $106.1 million at September 30, 2018. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to services activity and seasonal cycles of our business, ensuring competitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory obsolescence that may occur due to rapidly changing technology and customer demand. 
Prepaid expense and other current assets decreased 39.7% from $17.3 million at December 31, 2017 to $10.4 million at September 30, 2018. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred costs related to network installation services that were completed during the first quarter.  
Investing Activities 
Capital expenditures totaled approximately $5.7 million and $12.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer hardware, software, manufacturing and test equipment, and building improvements. 
Our combined short-term and long-term investments increased $3.8 million from $146.4 million at December 31, 2017 to $150.2 million at September 30, 2018. This increase reflects funds available for investment provided by our operating activities, as well as net realized and unrealized gains and losses and amortization of net premiums on our combined investments, partially offset by our cash needs for capital expenditures, purchases of treasury stock, and shareholder dividends. 
Our long-term investments increased 10.7% from $130.3 million at December 31, 2017 to $144.2 million at September 30, 2018. Long-term investments at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 included an investment in a certificate of deposit of $26.7 million and $27.8 million, respectively, which serves as collateral for our revenue bond. See “Debt” below for additional information. We have various equity investments included in long-term investments with a fair value of $40.9 million and $35.7 million, at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. 
Long-term investments at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 also included $20.9 million and $19.9 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plans, and $0.5 million of other investments carried at cost, consisting of interests in two private equity funds. 
Dividends 
In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we paid dividends totaling $13.0 million. 
Debt 
Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock that are implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $15.75 per share. As of September 30, 2018, we have the authority to purchase an additional 2.7 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors. 
We issued 0.1 million shares of treasury stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $18.97. We received proceeds totaling $1.3 million from the exercise of these stock options during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. 
We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of September 30, 2018, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments.  
On July 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock (bringing the total shares authorized for repurchase to 50.0 million). This authorization will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant.
