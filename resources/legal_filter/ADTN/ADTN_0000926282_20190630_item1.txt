Correction of Immaterial Misstatements. 
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company determined that there was an immaterial misstatement of its excess and obsolete inventory reserves in its previously issued annual and interim financial statements. The Company corrected this misstatement by recognizing a $0.8 million out-of-period adjustment during the three months ended June 30, 2019, which increased its excess and obsolete inventory reserve and cost of goods sold for the period. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the out-of-period adjustment was a cumulative $0.2 million reduction in its excess and obsolete inventory reserve and cost of goods sold. In addition, the Company determined that a $1.0 million cash inflow related to an insurance recovery was incorrectly classified as a cash flow from operations instead of a cash flow from investing activities within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2019 correctly reflects the $1.0 million insurance recovery as a cash inflow from investing activities. Management has determined that these misstatements were not material to any of its previously issued financial statements and that correction of the misstatements is also not material to the current or estimated annual 2019 financial results on both a quantitative and qualitative basis.  
The Company adopted the new standard on January 1, 2019, the effective date of our initial application, using the optional transition method. The Company has elected to carry forward the legacy ASC 840 disclosures for comparative periods and, therefore, did not adjust the comparative period financial information prior to January 1, 2019. In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients which allows for companies to not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, not reassess historical lease classifications for expired or existing contracts and not reassess initial direct costs for existing leases. Additionally, the Company elected the practical expedients which allow the use of hindsight when determining the lease term, the short-term lease recognition exemption and the option to not separate lease and non-lease components. The adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and corresponding right-of-use liability on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of $10.3 million, primarily related to our operating leases for office space, automobiles and other equipment.  
As a lessee, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income or Statement of Cash Flow. See Note 11 for additional information.  
As a lessor, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income or Condensed Statement of Cash Flow. Prior to and after adoption, all of our leases in which we are the lessor were classified as sales-types leases.  
Contingent liabilities with a fair value totaling $1.2 million were recognized at the acquisition date, the payments of which were dependent upon SmartRG achieving future revenue, EBIT or customer purchase order milestones during the first half of 2019. The required milestones were not achieved and, therefore, we recognized a gain of $1.2 million upon the reversal of these liabilities during the second quarter of 2019.  
An escrow in the amount of $2.8 million was set up at the acquisition date to fund post-closing working capital settlements and to satisfy indemnity obligations to the Company arising from any inaccuracy or breach of representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations of the sellers. The escrow is subject to arbitration with final settlement expected during the fourth quarter of 2020. The minimum and maximum potential release of funds to the sellers ranges from zero to $2.8 million.  
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, we incurred amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, related to the SmartRG acquisition. No acquisition-related expenses were incurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 related to the SmartRG acquisition. 
The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents the financial results of the Company, for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as if the acquisition of the Sumitomo EPON business had occurred on January 1, 2017. This unaudited supplemental pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2017, nor is it indicative of any future results. There were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information. 
The following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate our revenue by reportable segment. 
Revenue is measured based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to a customer and as performance obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied. For transactions where there are multiple performance obligations, we account for individual products and services separately if they are distinct (if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer). As of June 30, 2019, we did not have any significant performance obligations related to customer contracts that had an original expected duration of one year or more, other than maintenance services, which are satisfied over time.  
Included in other receivables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Of the outstanding unearned revenue balance at December 31, 2018, $3.6 million and $10.5 million was recognized as revenue during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from a benefit of 20.1%, excluding the tax effect of the bargain purchase gain, in the six months ended June 30, 2018, to a benefit of 6.2% in the six months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods was primarily driven by the shift to profitability in the six months ended June 30, 2019, with tax expense being offset by a 29.1% rate reduction related to a transfer pricing study completed during the second quarter of 2019 that resulted in the assignment of operating expenditures to specific company locations, and the effective income tax rates among the respective jurisdictions. 
Stock Options 
At June 30, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options was approximately $0.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 0.4 years. 
All of the options above were issued at exercise prices that approximated fair market value at the date of grant.  
The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between ADTRAN’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the quarter and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on June 30, 2019. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of ADTRAN’s stock and was zero as of June 30, 2019. The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $0.1 million.  
There were no stock options granted during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 or 2018. 
PSUs, RSUs and Restricted Stock 
The fair value of our PSUs with market and performance conditions is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation method. The fair value of RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the business day immediately preceding the grant date.  
At June 30, 2019, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested portion of market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock was approximately $14.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.6 years. In addition, there was $8.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested 2017 performance-based PSUs, which will be recognized over the remaining requisite service period of 0.5 years if achievement of the performance obligation becomes probable. For the three and six months ending June 30, 2019 and 2018, no compensation expense was recognized related to these 2017 performance-based PSUs. 
At June 30, 2019, 2.6 million stock options, PSUs, RSUs or restricted stock were available for grant under shareholder-approved equity plans. 
Debt Securities and Other Investments 
Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities as some borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 
At June 30, 2019, we held a $25.6 million restricted certificate of deposit that is carried at cost. This investment serves as a collateral deposit against the principal amount outstanding under loans made to ADTRAN pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond (the “Bond”), which totaled $25.6 million at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of the Bond using a level 2 valuation technique was approximately $25.6 million and $25.4 million, respectively, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard and Poor’s credit rating of AAA. We have the right to offset the balance of the Bond with the collateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness. The Bond matures on January 1, 2020, and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum. In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the State of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings we are required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under this program. We are required to make payments in the amounts necessary to pay the interest on the amounts currently outstanding. We have made annual principal payments in addition to the interest amounts that are due. The restricted funds held as collateral against the outstanding principal amount of the Bond will be used to pay the outstanding principal and interest upon the Bond’s maturity on January 1, 2020. 
Marketable Equity Securities 
ASU 2016-01 also provides a measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value in which investments can be recorded at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes for an identical or similar investment. We elected to record our equity investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value using the measurement alternative method. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a note receivable of approximately $4.3 million, which was included in other receivables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, this amount was repaid as follows. Approximately $3.4 million was issued as an equity investment, which represented a non-cash investing activity. The carrying value of this investment under the measurement alternative was $3.4 million as of June 30, 2019. The remaining amount was converted into a new note receivable, which is included in other receivables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and represents a non-cash operating activity. 
As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, gross unrealized losses related to individual investments in a continuous loss position for twelve months or longer were not material. 
The fair value of our Level 2 securities is calculated using a weighted average market price for each security. Market prices are obtained from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each security.  
Inventory reserves are established for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value of the inventory based on historical usage, known trends, inventory age, and market conditions. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our inventory reserve was $31.0 million and $30.0 million, respectively. 
We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test will be performed. Based on the results of our qualitative assessment in 2018, we concluded that it was not necessary to perform the two-step impairment test.  
Intangible assets include intangibles acquired in conjunction with several acquisitions since 2011, with the most recent being SmartRG, Inc. in November 2018.  
Amortization expense was $1.3 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 respectively, and $2.7 million and $1.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. 
We have operating leases for office space, automobiles, and various other equipment in the United States and in certain international locations in which we do business. We also have other contracts, such as manufacturing agreements and service agreements, which we reviewed to determine if they contain any embedded leases. We specifically reviewed these other contracts to determine whether we have the right to substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of any specified assets or the right to direct the use of any specified assets, either of which would indicate the existence of a lease.  
As of June 30, 2019, our operating leases have remaining lease terms of one month to six years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to three years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within three months. For those leases that are reasonably assured to be renewed, we have included the option to extend as part of our right of use asset and right of use liability. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense related to these short-term leases was $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Topic 842, we elected the practical expedient which allows us to not separate lease and non-lease components. None of our lease agreements contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 
Operating lease payments include $1.2 million related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. There are no legally binding leases that have not yet commenced.  
Certain renewal options were subsequently determined to not be reasonably assured of renewal upon the Company’s adoption of the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019.  
Our leases do not provide an implicit borrowing rate and therefore we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We used the incremental borrowing rate on January 1, 2019, for operating leases that commenced on or prior to that date. The incremental borrowing rate was determined on a portfolio basis by grouping leases with similar terms as well as grouping leases based on a U.S. dollar or Euro functional currency. The actual rate is then determined based on a credit spread over LIBOR as well as the Bloomberg Curve Matrix for the U.S. Communications section.  
Other Comprehensive Income 
With the Company’s adoption of ASU 2016-01 on January 1, 2018, unrealized gains on our equity investments were reclassified to retained earnings. See Note 7.

For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, 1.9 million and 5.0 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, 2.3 million and 4.8 million, respectively, stock options were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because the stock options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares, during the applicable periods, therefore making them anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, 15,000 and 0.1 million, respectively, and for both the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, 0.1 million PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock awards were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because the weighted average assumed proceeds per share were greater than the average market price of the common shares, during the applicable periods, therefore making them anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. 
Sales by Category 
We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments as of June 30, 2019. 
In February 2019, we announced the restructuring of certain of our workforce predominantly in Germany, which included the closure of the office location in Munich, Germany accompanied by relocation or severance benefits for the affected employees. We also offered voluntary early retirement to certain other employees, which was announced to employees in March 2019. The restructuring is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019.  
In January 2018, we announced an early retirement incentive program for employees that met certain requirements. The cumulative amount incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to this restructuring program was $7.3 million, of which $1.0 million and $7.0 million was incurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. We do not expect to incur any additional expenses related to this restructuring program. 
On July 17, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 1, 2019. The dividend was paid on August 15, 2019 and totaled $4.3 million. 
In September 2019, we entered into an operating lease for office space in India. This lease has an initial term of five years and includes an option to renew for an additional five-year period. As a result of this agreement, we will record a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability of approximately $10.2 million in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet during the third quarter of 2019.
