Sales were $120.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $170.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Our gross margin decreased to 32.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2018 from 43.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Our operating income margin decreased to (22.1)% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 4.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income (loss) was $(10.8) million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Our effective tax rate, excluding the effect of the bargain purchase gain in 2018, decreased to 15.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 20.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Earnings (loss) per share, assuming dilution, were $(0.22) for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.14 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. 
We recognized a positive impact to our revenues in the first half of 2017 due to our being awarded a network expansion program by a large European tier-1 customer. During the first quarter of 2018, this European Tier 1 customer undertook an additional network expansion project. We anticipate that as our Latin American customers resume their network upgrade projects, we may experience further enhancement to our revenues. We have recently announced receipt of a new nationwide award in the APAC region, as well as additional awards based on new ADTRAN technologies in the EMEA region that we believe will likely result in a positive impact to our revenues. However, a resolution of the regulatory changes affecting a major customer in Mexico has been slower than anticipated, and business with our customer in that region has not yet returned to a more normal level. We are continuing to pursue opportunities with new customers in this region. 
Network Solutions cost of sales, as a percent of that segment’s sales, increased from 53.4% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 65.2% in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to a regional revenue shift, customer and product mix, an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program, an increase in warranty expense due to a settlement in Q1 2017 with a third party supplier for a defective component and purchase discounts received from a contract manufacturer in Q1 2017. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3.6% from $34.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $33.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to decreases in deferred compensation expense, travel expense, performance-based compensation expense, independent contractor expense, and legal expense, partially offset by an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program.  
Research and development expenses increased 2.7% from $32.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $32.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to an increase in labor expense due to a restructuring program, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangibles acquired in the third quarter of 2016.  
Interest and dividend income decreased 7.2% from $933 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $866 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in interest and dividend income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to a decrease in investment balances and a decrease in the rate of return on those investments. 
Net realized investment gains decreased 120.6% from $0.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $(0.1) million in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in net realized investment gains for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to changes in fair value on equity securities recognized during the period under ASC 2016-01. Prior to January 1, 2018, changes in fair value were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, on the balance sheet. See note 1, note 7 and “Investing Activities” in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information. 
Other income (expense), net, comprised primarily of miscellaneous income, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts, investment account management fees, and scrap raw material sales, changed 142.5% from $0.1 million of income in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $0.1 million of expense in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The change in other income (expense), net for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to increased losses on our foreign exchange contracts. 
Gain on bargain purchase of a business is related to our acquisition of Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and entry into a technology license and supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. on March 19, 2018. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from 20.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 15.1%, excluding the tax impact of the bargain purchase gain, in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. 
As a result of the above factors, net income (loss) decreased $17.5 million from $6.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $(10.8) million in the three months ended March 31, 2018.  
Liquidity 
We intend to finance our operations with cash flow from operations. We have used, and expect to continue to use, the cash generated from operations for working capital, purchases of treasury stock, shareholder dividends, and other general corporate purposes, including (i) product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and (ii) expansion of sales and marketing activities. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. 
At March 31, 2018, cash on hand was $82.6 million and short-term investments were $16.4 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $99.0 million, of which $63.7 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017, cash on hand was $86.4 million and short-term investments were $16.1 million, which resulted in available short-term liquidity of $102.6 million, of which $56.8 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We intend to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S. and our current business plans do not indicate a need to repatriate these funds to finance domestic operations. The decrease in short-term liquidity from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to shifts among available investment option tenures to provide funds for our short-term cash needs. 
Operating Activities 
Our working capital, which consists of current assets less current liabilities, decreased 20.9% from $306.3 million as of December 31, 2017 to $242.2 million as of March 31, 2018, and our current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, decreased from 3.87 as of December 31, 2017 to 3.36 as of March 31, 2018 The decrease in our working capital and current ratio is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in other receivables. The quick ratio, defined as cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and net accounts receivable, divided by current liabilities, decreased from 2.31 as of December 31, 2017 to 1.75 as of March 31, 2018. The decrease in the quick ratio is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable.  
Accounts receivable decreased 43.9% from $144.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $80.9 million at March 31, 2018. We had no allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2017 or March 31, 2018. Quarterly accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased from 105 days as of December 31, 2017 to 60 days as of March 31, 2018 The decrease in net accounts receivable is due to the collection of customer specific payment terms that became due in the first quarter of 2018 and the timing of sales and collections during the quarter. Additionally, certain international customers can have longer payment terms than U.S. customers.  
Other receivables increased 32.2% from $26.6 million at December 31, 2017 to $35.1 million at March 31, 2018. The increase in other receivables is primarily attributable to an increase in tax receivable and the timing of filing returns and collections of VAT receivables in our international subsidiaries, partially offset by the timing of shipments and collections for materials supplied to our contract manufacturers during the quarter. 
Prepaid expense and other current assets decreased 43.9% from $17.3 million at December 31, 2017 to $9.7 million at March 31, 2018. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred costs related to network installation services that were completed during the quarter.  
Accounts payable decreased 16.5% from $60.6 million at December 31, 2017 to $50.7 million at March 31, 2018. Accounts payable will fluctuate due to variations in the timing of the receipt of supplies, inventory and services and our subsequent payments for these purchases. 
Investing Activities 
Capital expenditures totaled approximately $2.0 million and $3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer hardware, software, manufacturing and test equipment, and building improvements. 
Our combined short-term and long-term investments increased $26.5 million from $146.4 million at December 31, 2017 to $172.9 million at March 31, 2018. This increase reflects funds available for investment provided by our operating activities and stock option exercises by our employees, as well as net realized and unrealized gains and losses and amortization of net premiums on our combined investments, partially offset by our cash needs for capital expenditures, purchases of treasury stock, and shareholder dividends. 
Our long-term investments increased 20.1% from $130.3 million at December 31, 2017 to $156.5 million at March 31, 2018. Long-term investments at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 included an investment in a certificate of deposit of $26.7 million and $27.8 million, respectively, which serves as collateral for our revenue bond. See “Debt” below for additional information. We have various equity investments included in long-term investments with a fair value of $36.5 million and $35.7 million, at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. 
Long-term investments at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 also included $20.1 million and $19.9 million, respectively, related to our deferred compensation plans, and $0.5 million of other investments carried at cost, consisting of interests in two private equity funds and an investment in a privately held telecommunications equipment manufacturer. 
Dividends 
Debt 
Since 1997, our Board of Directors has approved multiple share repurchase programs that have authorized open market repurchase transactions of up to 50.0 million shares of our common stock, which will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we repurchased 0.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.18 per share. As of March 31, 2018, we have the authority to purchase an additional 2.9 million shares of our common stock under the current plans approved by the Board of Directors. 
We issued 24 thousand shares of treasury stock during the three months ended March 31, 2018 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $18.97. We received proceeds totaling $0.4 million from the exercise of these stock options during the three months ended March 31, 2018. 
We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of March 31, 2018, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments.  
On July 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock (bringing the total shares authorized for repurchase to 50.0 million). This authorization will be implemented through open market or private purchases from time to time as conditions warrant.
