In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary to fairly state these interim statements have been recorded and are of a normal and recurring nature. The results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. The interim statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in ADTRAN’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed on February 23, 2018 with the SEC. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entity's leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective approach is required. We anticipate the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have a material impact on our financial position; however, we do not believe adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations. We believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for operating leases for office space and equipment. 
The two primary areas of impact of these ASUs were network implementation service revenue performance obligations and contract costs. The output method will be used to measure network implementation services progress. The primary impact will be accelerated revenue recognition for certain performance obligations related to service revenue arrangements that were previously deferred until customer acceptance and capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract as described below.  
We recorded a bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, net of income taxes, which is subject to customary working capital adjustments between the parties. The bargain purchase gain of $11.3 million represents the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired over the cash paid. SEI, an OEM supplier based in Japan, is a market leader in EPON. SEI’s Broadband Networks Division through its SEL subsidiary operated a North American EPON business including sales, marketing, support, and region-specific engineering development. The North American EPON market is primarily driven by the Tier 1 cable MSO operators and has developed slower than anticipated. Through the transaction, SEI divested its North American EPON assets and established a relationship with ADTRAN. The transfer of these assets to ADTRAN, which included key customer relationships and required assumption by ADTRAN of relatively low incremental expenses, along with the value of the technology license and OEM supply agreement, resulted in the bargain purchase gain. We have assessed the recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on historical and forecasted data for future periods and have concluded that our valuation procedures and resulting measures were appropriate. 
The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information presents the financial results as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2017. This unaudited supplemental pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2017, nor is it indicative of any future results. Aside from revising the 2017 and 2018 net income for the effect of the bargain purchase gain, there were no material, non-recurring adjustments to this unaudited pro forma information. 
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, we incurred acquisition and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $0.2 million related to this acquisition. 
The following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate our revenue by reportable segment. 
Network Solutions includes hardware products and next-generation virtualized solutions used in service provider or business networks, as well as prior generation products.  
The majority of the revenue from this segment is from hardware sales and is recognized when control is transferred to our customers, which is generally when we ship the products. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded net of discounts and rebates using the most likely amount. Customers are typically invoiced when control is transferred and revenue is recognized. Our products generally include assurance-based warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects, which are accrued at the time revenue is recognized. 
In certain transactions, we are also the lessor in sales-type lease arrangements for network equipment, which have terms of 18 months to five years. These arrangements typically include network equipment, network implementation services and maintenance services. Product revenue for these leases is generally recorded when we transfer control of the product to our customers. Revenue for network implementation and maintenance services is recognized as described below. Customers are typically invoiced and pay in equal installments over the lease term.  
Our maintenance service periods range from one month to five years. Customers are typically invoiced and pay for maintenance services at the beginning of the maintenance period, which is recorded in current or non-current unearned revenue depending on the length of the service period. Maintenance services are provided on an as-needed basis and our customers benefit evenly throughout the contract term. Accordingly, we recognize revenue for maintenance services on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period in services revenue.  
We recognize revenue for network implementation, which primarily consists of engineering, execution and enablement services, when performance obligations are complete at a point in time. If we have recognized revenue, but not billed the customer, the right to consideration is recognized as a contract asset, which is included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The contract asset is transferred to accounts receivable when the right to consideration to payment becomes unconditional. 
As of March 31, 2018, we did not have any remaining performance obligations related to customer contracts that had an original expected duration of one year or more, other than maintenance services, which are satisfied over time. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from 20.3% in the three months ended March 31, 2017, to 15.1%, excluding the tax impact of the bargain purchase gain, in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate between the two periods is primarily attributable to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.  
The components of net periodic pension cost other than the service cost component are included in the line item “Other income (expense), net” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
As of March 31, 2018, there was $2.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 1.3 years. 
The fair value of our stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that may have a significant impact on the fair value estimate. 
There were no stock options granted during the three months ended March 31, 2018 or 2017. 
The fair value of our PSUs with market conditions is calculated using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. The fair value of RSUs and restricted stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. During the first quarter of 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a PSU grant of 0.5 million shares that contain performance conditions. The fair value of these performance-based PSU awards was equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant.  
As of March 31, 2018, there was $12.9 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested market-based PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 2.9 years. In addition, there was $10.7 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested performance-based PSUs, which will be recognized over the requisite service period of three years as achievement of the performance objective becomes probable. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, no compensation expense was recognized related to these performance-based PSU awards. 
Prior to January 1, 2018, our marketable equity securities were classified as available-for-sale. Realized gains and losses on marketable equity securities were included in net realized investment gain (loss). Unrealized gains and losses were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, on the balance sheet. 
As of March 31, 2018 and 2017, gross unrealized losses related to individual investments in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant. 
The fair value of our Level 2 securities is calculated using a weighted average market price for each security. Market prices are obtained from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value of each security. 
We participate in foreign exchange forward contracts in connection with the management of exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 
Our cash flow hedging activities utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the planned purchase of products from foreign suppliers. Purchases of U.S. denominated inventory by our European subsidiary represent our primary exposure. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are not recognized in current operating results, but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts related to cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. This reclassification is recorded in the same line item of the consolidated statements of income at which the effects of the hedged item are recorded, which is cost of sales. 
We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. Our derivative instruments are not subject to master netting arrangements and are not offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
As of March 31, 2018, we had no foreign exchange forward contracts. 
We establish reserves for estimated excess, obsolete, or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated fair value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, raw materials reserves totaled $15.2 million and $15.0 million, respectively, and finished goods inventory reserves totaled $8.9 million and $8.3 million, respectively. 
Intangible assets are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and include intangibles acquired in conjunction with our acquisitions of Bluesocket, Inc. on August 4, 2011, the NSN BBA business on May 4, 2012, CommScope’s active fiber access business on September 13, 2016 and Sumitomo Electric Lightwave Corp.’s North American EPON business and technology license and OEM supply agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. on March 19, 2018. 
The following table presents our intangible assets as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Fully amortized intangible assets have been removed from prior year balances for comparability. 
Amortization expense, all of which relates to business acquisitions, was $0.4 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
We issued 24 thousand shares of treasury stock during the three months ended March 31, 2018 to accommodate employee stock option exercises. The stock options had exercise prices ranging from $15.29 to $18.97. We received proceeds totaling $0.4 million from the exercise of these stock options during the three months ended March 31, 2018. 
Other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities; unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges; reclassification adjustments for amounts included in net income related to impairments of available-for-sale securities, realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, realized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, and amortization of actuarial gains (losses) related to our defined benefit plan; defined benefit plan adjustments; and foreign currency translation adjustments. 
With the adoption of ASU 2016-01, the unrealized gains on our equity investments were reclassified to retained earnings. See note 1 for more information. 
Included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $7.9 million in two private equity funds, and we have contributed $8.4 million as of March 31, 2018, of which $7.7 million has been applied to these commitments. 
On April 17, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share to be paid to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 2, 2018. The payment date will be May 16, 2018. The quarterly dividend payment will be approximately $4.3 million. In July 2003, our Board of Directors elected to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock considering the tax treatment of dividends and adequate levels of Company liquidity.
