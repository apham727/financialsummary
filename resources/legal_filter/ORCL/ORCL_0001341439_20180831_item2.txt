Item 2.  
Oracle Corporation provides products and services that address all aspects of information technology (IT) environments—applications, platform and infrastructure. Our applications, platform and infrastructure offerings are delivered to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models, including cloud-based, on-premise, or hybrid, which enable customer choice and flexibility. We market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a worldwide sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.  
Cloud and License Business  
Our cloud and license line of business, which represented 81% of our total revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings.  
cloud services revenues, which includes revenues from Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offerings (collectively, Oracle Cloud Services), which provide customers access to applications, platform and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, hosts, manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. The majority of our Oracle Cloud Services arrangements are billed in advance of the cloud services being performed; have durations of one to three years; are generally renewed; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. 
Cloud license and on-premise license revenues include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among others, which our customers use for cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over their contractual terms. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase license support contracts, as described above. 
Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand has increased for our Oracle Cloud Services. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications, platform and infrastructure licenses and license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. We expect these trends to continue. 
expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings; 
continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings; and 
contributions from our acquisitions. 
We believe all of these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development to develop and improve our cloud and license products and services. 
Our cloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base; the renewal of existing customers’ cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year; and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues over those four quarterly periods.  
Hardware Business  
Our hardware business, which represented 10% of our total revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, provides a broad selection of hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware related software, and related hardware support. The hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through  
indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products such as Oracle Solaris. Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms. 
Acquisitions 
Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. In recent years, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies.

Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information  
Constant Currency Presentation 
Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As a result, each businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Quarterly Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2018, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on August 31, 2018 and 2017, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.17 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (using 1.17 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.20 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 (using 1.20 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 using the May 31, 2018 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency. 
Total Revenues and Operating Expenses 
Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 primarily due to growth in our cloud and license revenues, which were partially offset by decreases in our hardware revenues and services revenues. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as customers purchased our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and renewed their related contracts to continue to gain access to our latest technology and support services. The constant currency decrease in our hardware revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was due to the reduction in our hardware products revenues and hardware support revenues primarily due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our cloud and license technologies. The constant currency decrease in our services revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was attributable to declines in our consulting services revenues. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 54%, 38% and 8%, respectively, to the growth in our first quarter of fiscal 2019 total revenues.  
In constant currency, our total operating margin increased during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 primarily due to the increase in total revenues; and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues remained flat.  
Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges 
In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we did not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers for which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods. 
Certain acquired companies capitalized sales commissions associated with subscription agreements and amortized these amounts over the related contractual terms. Business combination accounting rules generally require us to eliminate these acquired capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date and our post-combination GAAP sales and marketing expenses generally do not reflect the amortization of these acquired deferred sales commissions balances. This adjustment is intended to include, and thus reflect, the full amount of amortization related to such balances as though the acquired companies operated independently in the periods presented. 
Restructuring expenses during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2019 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2019 Restructuring Plan). Restructuring expenses during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2017 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2017 Restructuring Plan). Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in management’s discussion below under “Restructuring Expenses”, Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018. 
Stock-based compensation included in acquisition related and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated generally upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those stock options and restricted stock-based awards. 
Cloud and License Business 
Our cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through various deployment models including license support offerings; Oracle Cloud Services offerings; and cloud license and on-premise license offerings. License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. Our cloud services deliver certain of our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, host, manage and support, and revenues are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one to three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and  
on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs. 
Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations, total revenues from our cloud and license business increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, relative to the corresponding prior year period, due to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues, which was primarily due to increased customer purchases and renewals of cloud-based services and license support services in recent periods for which we delivered such services during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and due to contributions from our recent acquisitions. In constant currency, our total applications revenues and our total platform and infrastructure revenues each grew during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, each relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, as customers continued to deploy our applications technologies and platform and infrastructure technologies through a wide array of different deployment models that we offer to enable customer choice. The Americas region contributed 52%, the EMEA region contributed 31%, and the Asia Pacific region contributed 17%, of the constant currency revenues growth for this business during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. 
In constant currency, total cloud and license expenses increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher sales and marketing expenses and higher cloud services and license support expenses, both of which increased primarily due to higher employee related expenses from higher headcount. In addition, our constant currency cloud services and license support expenses increased during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 due to higher technology infrastructure expenses that supported the growth in our revenues.  
Hardware Business 
Our hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware. The hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings. 
In constant currency, total margin and total margin as percentage of revenues for our hardware segment increased during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, due to lower expenses.  
Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 primarily due to revenue declines in our consulting services. Constant currency decreases in our services revenues in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions were partially offset by a constant currency services revenues increase in the EMEA region.  
In constant currency, total services expenses increased during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 primarily due to an increase in headcount related expenses associated with our consulting offerings. In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues decreased during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to the decrease in revenues for this business. 
Excluding stock-based compensation 
On a constant currency basis, total research and development expenses were flat in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 relative to the corresponding prior year period.  
Excluding stock-based compensation  
On a constant currency basis, total general and administrative expenses increased modestly during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, relative to the corresponding prior year period primarily due to higher professional services expenses that were primarily legal related, and higher stock-based compensation. 
Amortization of intangible assets increased during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 relative to the corresponding prior year period due to additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions, partially offset by a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized.  
On a constant currency basis, acquisition related and other expenses increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher transitional employee related costs. 
Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018. 
Restructuring expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 primarily related to our 2019 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily related to our 2017 Restructuring Plan, which is substantially complete. Our management approved, committed to and initiated these plans in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2019 Restructuring Plan are up to $432 million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our condensed consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred. The total estimated remaining restructuring costs associated with the 2019 Restructuring Plan were approximately $325 million as of August 31, 2018 and the majority of the remaining costs are expected to be incurred through the end of fiscal 2020. Our estimated costs are subject to change in future periods.  
Interest expense increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $10.0 billion of senior notes in November 2017 which was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting from the maturity and repayment of $6.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2018.  
On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher interest income resulting from higher interest rates. 
Provision for income taxes decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, relative to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to the net favorable impact of the Tax Act (taking into account the favorable impact on our tax profile) during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, pursuant to SAB 118, partially offset by lower realized excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. 
The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of August 31, 2018 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from the May 31, 2018 balance sheet date. 
Net cash provided by investing activities was $3.5 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $1.8 billion of net cash used for investing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in net of proceeds received from sales and maturities of marketable securities and other investments, net of purchases. 
Net cash used for financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due primarily to increased stock repurchases (we repurchased $10.0 billion of common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $502 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018) and lower cash inflows from stock option exercises relative to the corresponding prior year period. These unfavorable financing cash flows were partially offset by a reduction in the amount of debt repayments made during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 relative to the corresponding prior year period.  
institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $89 million and $191 million, respectively, or approximately 10% and 21%, respectively, of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018. 
We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. 
Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options 
Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders.
