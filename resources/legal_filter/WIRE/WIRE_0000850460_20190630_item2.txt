Encore believes it is a low-cost manufacturer of electrical building wire and cable. The Company is a significant supplier of building wire for interior electrical wiring in commercial and industrial buildings, homes, apartments, and manufactured housing.
Net sales were $336.9 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $336.8 million in the second quarter of 2018. The virtually identical net sales dollars are primarily the result of a 5.6% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset by a 6.1% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire. Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period. The 5.6% increase in unit volume shipped was primarily due to strong construction industry demand despite rough spring weather in certain areas that slowed construction and impacted volumes in the second quarter of 2019. Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper and other raw material prices and product price competition. The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 8.7% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire. 
Cost of goods sold was $291.0 million, or 86.4% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $292.3 million, or 86.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018. Gross profit increased to $45.9 million, or 13.6% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2019 from $44.5 million, or 13.2% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018.
The small increase in gross profit margin percentage was primarily the result of two factors that served to mostly offset each other. Unit volumes increased 5.6%, while the spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sales price for a pound of copper contained in finished wire decreased 0.4% in the second quarter of 2019 versus the second quarter of 2018. The spread decreased as a result of the average sales price per pound of copper sold decreasing 6.1% while the per pound cost of raw copper purchased decreased 8.7%. The percentage change on sales is on a higher nominal dollar amount than on purchases and, therefore, spreads change on a nominal dollar basis. The margin changes were due primarily to the competitive pricing environment in the industry. In aluminum wire, which represented 8.0% of our net sales in the second quarter of 2019, we continue to enforce our rights under the U.S. trade remedy laws. On May 30, 2019, the U.S. Commerce Department imposed a preliminary antidumping ruling on imports of aluminum wire from China at rates ranging from 58.36 to 63.32 percent. The final results of the U.S. Government’s ongoing antidumping and countervailing duty investigations are not expected until the end of the year. 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first out (LIFO) method, or market. The Company maintains two inventory pools for LIFO purposes. As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis and makes a monthly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO. The Company applies the lower of cost or market (LCM) test by comparing the LIFO cost of its raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods inventories to estimated market values, which are based primarily upon the most recent quoted market price of copper and other material prices as of the end of each reporting period. The Company performs a lower of cost or market calculation quarterly. As of June 30, 2019, no LCM adjustment was required. However, decreases 
Net sales for the first six months of 2019 were $651.6 million compared to net sales of $628.2 million for the first six months of 2018. This 3.7% increase in net sales is primarily the result of a 2.8% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 9.3% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, partially offset by a 5.9% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire. Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period. Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper and other raw material prices and product price competition. The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 9.1% in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold increased to $564.3 million in the first six months of 2019, compared to $546.2 million in the first six months of 2018. Gross profit increased to $87.2 million, or 13.4% of net sales, in the first six months of 2019 versus $82.0 million, or 13.1% of net sales, in the first six months of 2018.
The gross profit margin percentage increased primarily as a result of the 9.3% unit volume increase and an increase in the spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sale price for a pound of copper in the first six months of 2019 versus the first six months of 2018 due primarily to competitive industry pricing. Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper raw material prices and product price competition. The copper spread increased 0.9% in the first six months of 2019 versus the first six months of 2018. The spread increased as a result of the 5.9% decrease in the average sales price per copper pound sold while the per pound cost of raw copper decreased 9.1%. In nominal dollars, the sales price decreased less than the cost of copper.
volume movements of other materials in the first six months of 2019, LIFO adjustments were recorded, increasing cost of sales by $0.5 million. During the same period in 2018, LIFO adjustments were recorded, increasing cost of sales by $3.7 million. Based on current copper prices, there is no LCM adjustment necessary. Future reductions in the price of copper could require the Company to record an LCM adjustment against the related inventory balance, which would result in a negative impact on net income.
Selling expenses for the first six months of 2019 increased to $33.7 million, or 5.2% of net sales, compared to $32.9 million, or
The Company maintains a substantial inventory of finished products to satisfy customers’ delivery requirements promptly. As is customary in the building wire industry, the Company provides payment terms to most of its customers that exceed terms that it receives from its suppliers. Copper suppliers generally give very short payment terms (less than 15 days) while the Company and the building wire industry give customers much longer terms. In general, the Company’s standard payment terms result in the collection of a significant majority of net sales within approximately 75 days of the date of invoice. As a result of this timing difference, building wire companies must have sufficient cash and access to capital resources to finance their working capital needs, thereby creating a barrier to entry for companies who do not have sufficient liquidity and capital resources. The two largest components of working capital, receivables and inventory, and to a lesser extent, capital expenditures, are the primary drivers of the Company’s liquidity needs. Generally, these needs will cause the Company’s cash balance to rise and fall inversely to the receivables and inventory balances. The Company’s receivables and inventories will rise and fall in concert with several factors, most notably the price of copper and other raw materials and the level of unit sales. Capital expenditures have historically been necessary to expand and update the production capacity of the Company’s manufacturing operations. The Company has historically satisfied its liquidity and capital expenditure needs with cash generated from operations and borrowings under its various debt arrangements. The Company historically uses its revolving credit facility to manage day to day operating cash needs as required by daily fluctuations in working capital and has the facility in place should such a need arise in the future.
Cash provided by operating activities was $27.9 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to $6.0 million of cash used in the first six months of 2018. The following changes in components of cash flow from operations were notable. The Company had net income of $31.2 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to net income of $29.4 million in the first six months of 2018. Accounts receivable increased $20.6 million in the first six months of 2019 and $29.5 million in the first six months of 2018, resulting in a positive change in cash flow of $8.9 million in the first six months of 2019 versus the first six months of 2018. Accounts receivable generally fluctuate in proportion to dollar sales and, to a lesser extent, are affected by the timing of when sales occur during a given quarter. With an average of 60 to 75 days of sales outstanding, quarters in which sales are more back-end loaded will have higher accounts receivable balances outstanding at quarter-end. Inventory value decreased $6.3 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to increasing $4.5 million in the first six months 2018 producing a positive swing in cash flow of $10.8 million in 2019 versus 2018. Trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities provided cash of $2.3 million in the first six months of 2019 versus using $9.6 million in the first six months of 2018, resulting in a positive change in cash flow of $11.9 million. In the first six months of 2019, changes in current and deferred taxes used cash of $1.1 million versus a $1.3 million use of cash in the first six months of 2018. These changes in cash flow were the primary drivers of the $33.8 million increase in cash provided by operations in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018.
During the remainder of 2019, the Company expects its capital expenditures will consist primarily of expenditures related to the purchases of manufacturing equipment throughout its facilities to update equipment and address production bottlenecks. The total capital expenditures for all of 2019 associated with these projects are currently estimated to be between $40 million and $45 million. We have plans on the drawing board for significant capital expenditures, but these plans have been delayed by issues arising in connection with a highway expansion project which may bisect our property. The Company also expects its future working capital requirements to fluctuate as a result of changes in unit sales volumes and the price of copper and other raw materials. The Company believes that the current cash balance, cash flow from operations, and the financing available from its revolving credit facility will satisfy anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements during 2019.
