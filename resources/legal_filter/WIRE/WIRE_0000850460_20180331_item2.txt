Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 Compared to Quarter Ended March 31, 2017 
Net sales were $291.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $279.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. This 4.3% increase in net sales is primarily the result of a 6.4% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 15.6% increase in the average selling price of copper wire offset by a 7.9% decrease in copper wire unit volume shipped. Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period. Fluctuations in sales prices are primarily a result of changing copper and other raw material prices and product price competition. The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased increased 18.3% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 and was the principal driver of the increased average sales price of copper wire. Unit volume decreased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to particularly rough winter weather that slowed construction and impacted our volumes, particularly in January.
Cost of goods sold was $253.9 million, or 87.1% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $240.2 million, or 86.0% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit decreased to $37.5 million, or 12.9% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018 versus $39.2 million, or 14.0% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2017.
The decrease in gross profit margin percentage was driven by multiple factors, including a 7.9% decline in copper wire unit sales, which was more than offset by the increase of the copper wire spread. The spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sales price for a pound of copper contained in finished wire increased 10.1% in the first quarter of 2018 versus the first quarter of 2017. The spread increased as a result of the average sales price per copper pound sold increasing 15.6% while the per pound cost of raw copper increased 18.3%. Increases in the cost of other raw materials more than offset the positive impact of the increased copper spread on gross profit margins. The percentage change on sales is on a higher nominal dollar amount than on purchases and, therefore, spreads change on a nominal dollar basis. The margin changes were due primarily to the competitive pricing environment in the industry.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, increased to 76.5% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018, from 73.9% of net sales in the first quarter of 2017. Lower overhead costs as a percentage of net sales somewhat offset this increase in total raw materials cost as a percentage of net sales. Overheads contained some fixed and semi-fixed components which will fluctuate as a percentage of sales when sales dollars vary.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first out (LIFO) method, or market. The Company maintains two inventory pools for LIFO purposes. As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis and makes a monthly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO. The Company applies the lower of cost or market (LCM) test by comparing the LIFO cost of its raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods inventories to estimated market values, which are based primarily upon the most recent quoted market price of copper, aluminum and finished wire prices as of the end of each reporting period. The Company performs a lower of cost or market calculation quarterly. As of March 31, 2018, no LCM adjustment was required. 
The Company maintains a substantial inventory of finished products to satisfy customers’ delivery requirements promptly. As is customary in the building wire industry, the Company provides payment terms to most of its customers that exceed terms that it receives from its suppliers. Copper suppliers generally give very short payment terms (less than 15 days) while the Company and the building wire industry give customers much longer terms. In general, the Company’s standard payment terms result in the collection of a significant majority of net sales within approximately 75 days of the date of invoice. As a result of this timing difference, building wire companies must have sufficient cash and access to capital resources to finance their working capital needs, thereby creating a barrier to entry for companies who do not have sufficient liquidity and capital resources. The two largest components of working capital, receivables and inventory, and to a lesser extent, capital expenditures, are the primary drivers of the Company’s liquidity needs. Generally, these needs will cause the Company’s cash balance to rise and fall inversely to the receivables and inventory balances. The Company’s receivables and inventories will rise and fall in concert with several factors, most notably the price of copper and other raw materials and the level of unit sales. Capital expenditures have historically been necessary to expand and update the production capacity of the Company’s manufacturing operations. The Company has historically satisfied its liquidity and capital expenditure needs with cash generated from operations and borrowings under its various debt arrangements. The Company historically uses its revolving credit facility to manage day to day operating cash needs as required by daily fluctuations in working capital and has the facility in place should such a need arise in the future.
Cash used in operating activities was $8.0 million in the first three months of 2018 compared to $4.4 million in the first three months of 2017. The following changes in components of cash flow from operations were notable. The Company had net income of $11.4 million in the first three months of 2018 compared to net income of $13.6 million in the first three months of 2017. Accounts receivable increased $19.6 million in the first three months of 2018 compared to increasing $26.7 million in the first three months of 2017, resulting in a negative change in cash flow of $7.1 million in the first three months of 2018 versus the first three months of 2017. Accounts receivable generally fluctuate in proportion to dollar sales and, to a lesser extent, are affected by the timing of when sales occur during a given quarter. With an average of 60 to 75 days of sales outstanding, quarters in which sales are more back-end loaded will have higher accounts receivable balances outstanding at quarter-end. Inventory value increased in the first three months of 2018 and 2017, using cash of $2.1 million and $2.4 million in the first three months of 2018 and 2017. Trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities used cash of $6.6 million in 2018 versus a $9.2 million source of cash in 2017, resulting in a negative change in cash flow of $15.8 million. In the first three months of 2018, changes in current and deferred taxes provided cash of $3.6 million versus using cash of $2.4 million in the first three months of 2017. These changes in cash flow were the primary drivers of the $3.5 million increase in cash used in operations in the first three months of 2018 compared to the first three months of 2017.
Cash used in investing activities increased to $7.5 million in the first three months of 2018 from $4.6 million in the first three months of 2017, due to higher capital expenditures on plant and equipment. Cash used in financing activities consisted of $0.4 
million of cash dividends paid, partially offset by $0.3 million of proceeds from exercised stock options. These changes in cash flow were the primary drivers of the $0.1 million of cash used in financing activities for the first three months of 2018 versus $0.2 million used in the first three months of 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the balance on the Company’s revolving line of credit remained at zero. The Company’s cash balance was $107.8 million at March 31, 2018 versus $86.5 million at March 31, 2017.
During the remainder of 2018, the Company expects its capital expenditures will consist primarily of expenditures related to the purchases of manufacturing equipment throughout its facilities to update equipment and address production bottlenecks. The total capital expenditures for all of 2018 associated with these projects are currently estimated to be between $28 million and $33 million. The Company also expects its future working capital requirements to fluctuate as a result of changes in unit sales volumes and the price of copper and other raw materials. The Company believes that the current cash balance, cash flow from operations, and the financing available from its revolving credit facility will satisfy anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements during 2018.
