Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” providing guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB voted to delay the effective date for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permissible one year earlier. The standard permits the use of either modified retrospective or full retrospective transition methods. The Company has substantially completed an impact assessment of the potential changes from adopting ASU 2014-09. The impact assessment included a review of customer arrangements across all of its global business units and an in-depth analysis of its global revenue processes and accounting policies to identify potential areas where change may be needed to comply with this guidance. The Company plans to apply the modified retrospective transition method. The Company assembled an implementation work team to assess and document the accounting conclusions for the adoption of ASU 2014-09. Based on this analysis, the Company does not believe the adoption of the ASU will have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to assess the potential impact on accounting policies, internal control processes and related disclosures required under the new guidance.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). This update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)”, which requires an entity to report the service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the same line item as other compensation costs. The other components of net (benefit) cost will be required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 
15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.
3. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair values of lead forward contracts are calculated using observable prices for lead as quoted on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) and, therefore, were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in its 2017 Annual Report.
The fair values for foreign currency forward contracts are based upon current quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2 based on the nature of the underlying market in which these derivatives are traded.
Financial Instruments
The fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to their short maturities. 
The fair value of the Company’s short-term debt and borrowings under the new 2017 Credit Facility and the previous 2011 Credit Facility (each as defined in Note 9), approximate their respective carrying value, as they are variable rate debt and the terms are comparable to market terms as of the balance sheet dates and are classified as Level 2.
The Company's 5.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”), with an original face value of $300,000, were issued in April 2015. The fair value of these Notes represent the trading values based upon quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2. The Notes were trading at approximately 104% and 101% of face value on December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. 
Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships
Lead Forward Contracts
The Company enters into lead forward contracts to fix the price for a portion of its lead purchases. Management considers the lead forward contracts to be effective against changes in the cash flows of the underlying lead purchases. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. At December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company has hedged the price to purchase approximately 54.0 million pounds and 45.0 million pounds of lead, respectively, for a total purchase price of $60,849 and $46,550, respectively.

7. Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation
Litigation and Other Legal Matters
information in connection with various aspects of their activities.
European Competition Investigations 
Certain of the Company’s European subsidiaries had received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews from, and have had on-site inspections conducted by, the competition authorities of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands relating to conduct and anticompetitive practices of certain industrial battery participants. 
In June 2017, the Company settled a portion of its previously disclosed proceeding involving the German competition authority relating to conduct involving the Company's motive power battery business and agreed to pay a fine of $14,811, which was paid in July 2017. As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 and $13,463, respectively, relating to this matter. Also in June 2017, the German competition authority issued a fining decision related to the Company's reserve power battery business, which constitutes the remaining portion of the previously disclosed German proceeding. The Company is appealing this decision, including payment of the proposed fine of $11,415, and believes that the reserve power matter does not, based on current facts and circumstances known to management, require an accrual. The Company is not required to escrow any portion of this fine during the appeal process.
In July 2017, the Company settled the Dutch regulatory proceeding and agreed to pay a fine of $11,229, which was paid in August 2017. As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 and $10,258, respectively, relating to the Dutch regulatory proceeding.
As a result of its operations, the Company is subject to various federal, state, and local, as well as international environmental laws and regulations and is exposed to the costs and risks of registering, handling, processing, storing, transporting, and disposing of hazardous substances, especially lead and acid. The Company’s operations are also subject to federal, state, local and international occupational safety and health regulations, including laws and regulations relating to exposure to lead in the workplace. 
The Company is responsible for certain cleanup obligations at the former Yuasa battery facility in Sumter, South Carolina, that predates its ownership of this facility. This manufacturing facility was closed in 2001 and the Company established a reserve for this facility, which was $1,117 and $1,123 as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017. Based on current information, the Company’s management believes this reserve is adequate to satisfy the Company’s environmental liabilities at this facility. This facility is separate from the Company’s current metal fabrication facility in Sumter.
Lead and Foreign Currency Forward Contracts
To stabilize its lead costs and reduce volatility from currency movements, the Company enters into contracts with financial institutions. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. Please refer to Note 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments for more details. 
During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company completed the sale of its Cleveland, Ohio facility and recorded a non-cash loss on the sale of the building of $210 and other cash charges of $75. The Cleveland facility ceased charger production in fiscal 2017.
During fiscal 2018, the Company announced a restructuring program to improve efficiencies of its general operations in the Americas.

The Notes will mature on April 30, 2023, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased in full. The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the “Guarantees”), jointly and severally, by certain of its subsidiaries that are guarantors (the “Guarantors”) under the 2011 Credit Facility and its successor, the 2017 Credit Facility. The Guarantees are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Guarantors.
On August 4, 2017, the Company entered into a new credit facility (“2017 Credit Facility”). The 2017 Credit Facility matures on September 30, 2022 and comprises a $600,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolver”) and a $150,000 senior secured term loan (“2017 Term Loan”). The Company's previous credit facility (“2011 Credit Facility”) comprised a $500,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (“2011 Revolver”) and a $150,000 senior secured incremental term loan (the “2011 Term Loan”) with a maturity date of September 30, 2018.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company maintains the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (“2017 EIP”). The 2017 EIP reserved 3,177,477 shares of common stock for the grant of various classes of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units, market condition-based share units and other forms of equity-based compensation.
The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense associated with its equity incentive plans of $5,250 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and $4,699 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.

12. Stockholders’ Equity and Noncontrolling Interests
Accelerated Share Repurchase
During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”) with a major financial institution to repurchase up to $100,000 of its common stock. The Company prepaid $100,000 and received an initial delivery of 1,278,976 shares with a fair market value of approximately $80,000. The ASR is accounted for as a treasury stock repurchase, reducing the weighted average number of basic and diluted shares outstanding by the 1,278,976 shares initially received, and as a forward contract indexed to the Company's own common shares to reflect the future settlement provisions. Because the maximum repurchase will be $100,000, as of December 31, 2017, $20,000 representing the difference between the fair value of shares delivered and the maximum notional amount of $100,000, is accounted for as an equity instrument and is included in additional paid-in capital. The ASR is not accounted for as a derivative instrument.
No shares were received pursuant to the ASR during the current quarter. 
On January 9, 2018, the ASR was settled, and the Company received an additional 216,738 shares. See Note 15 - Subsequent Events, for more information.
