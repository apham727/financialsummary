Alpha Acquisition
On December 7, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Alpha Technologies Services, Inc. (“ATS”) and Alpha Technologies Ltd. (“ATL”), resulting in ATS and ATL becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the “share purchase”). Additionally, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Alpha Technologies Inc. and certain assets of Altair Advanced Industries, Inc. and other affiliates of ATS and ATL (all such sellers, together with ATS and ATL, “Alpha”), in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain restructuring agreements (collectively, the “asset acquisition” and together with the share purchase, the “acquisition”). Based in Bellingham, Washington, Alpha is a global industry leader in the comprehensive commercial-grade energy solutions for broadband, telecom, renewable, industrial and traffic customers around the world. The initial purchase consideration for the acquisition was $750.0 million of which $650.0 million was paid in cash and the balance was settled by issuing 1,177,630 shares of EnerSys common stock. These shares were issued out of the Company's treasury stock and were valued at $84.92 per share, which was based on the thirty-day volume weighted average stock price of the Company’s common stock at closing, in accordance with the purchase agreement. The 1,177,630 shares had a closing date fair value of $93.3 million, based upon the December 7, 2018 closing date spot rate of $79.20. The total purchase consideration, consisting of cash paid of $650.0 million, shares valued at $93.3 million and adjustment for working capital (due from seller of $0.8 million) was $742.5 million.
 The results of operations of Alpha have been included in the Company’s Americas segment.
NorthStar Acquisition
On September 30, 2019, we completed the acquisition of NorthStar, headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, for $78.0 million in cash consideration and the assumption of $104.5 million in debt, which was funded using existing cash and credit facilities. NorthStar, through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, manufactures and distributes thin plate pure lead (TPPL) batteries and battery enclosures.
Economic Climate
Recent indicators suggest a slowdown in economic activity among all the different geographical regions in which we do business.
Volatility of Commodities and Foreign Currencies
Customer Pricing
We believe that our financial position is strong, and we have substantial liquidity with $425 million of available cash and cash equivalents and available and undrawn credit lines of approximately $426 million at September 29, 2019 to cover short-term liquidity requirements and anticipated growth in the foreseeable future.
We believe that our strong capital structure and liquidity affords us access to capital for future acquisition and stock repurchase opportunities and continued dividend payments.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $101.6 million or 15.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. This increase was the result of a 22% increase due to the Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a 4% decrease in organic volume, a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact and a 1% decrease in pricing. 
Net sales increased $210.9 million or 15.8% in the six months of fiscal 2020 as compared to the six months of fiscal 2019. This increase was the result of a 22% increase due to the Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a 3% decrease in organic volume, a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact and a 1% decrease in pricing.
Segment sales
The Americas segment’s net sales increased $136.3 million or 35.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 38% increase from the Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a 1% decrease each in organic volume, pricing and foreign currency translation impact. Net sales increased $260.9 or 33.4% in the six months of fiscal 2020 as compared to the six months of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 38% increase from the Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a 3% decrease in organic volume and a 1% decrease each in pricing and foreign currency translation impact.
The EMEA segment’s net sales decreased $21.2 million or 10.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 5% decrease in foreign currency translation impact, a 4% decrease in organic volume and a 1% decrease in pricing. Net sales decreased $28.5 or 6.9% in the six months of fiscal 2020 as compared to the six months of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 5% decrease due to foreign currency translation impact and a 1% decrease each in organic volume and pricing.
The Asia segment’s net sales decreased $13.5 million or 19.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 17% decrease in organic volume and a 3% decrease in foreign currency translation impact. Net sales decreased $21.5 or 15.8% in the six months of fiscal 2020 as compared to the six months of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 12% decrease in organic volume and a 4% decrease in foreign currency translation impact.
Product line sales
Net sales of our reserve power products in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $113.4 million or 36.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to a 46% increase from the Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a 7% decrease in organic volume, a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact and a 1% decrease in pricing. The decrease in organic volume is primarily from the deferral of spending by telecom and broadband customers and the conclusion of a large enclosure order a year ago. Net sales increased $225.2 or 35.4% in the six months of fiscal 2020 as compared to the six months of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 47% increase from the Alpha acquisition, partially offset by a 9% decrease in organic volume, a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact and a 1% decrease in pricing.
Net sales of our motive power products segment in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased by $11.8 million or 3.4% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a 2% decrease in foreign currency translation impact and a 1% decrease in pricing. Net sales decreased $14.3 or 2.1% in the six months of fiscal 2020 as compared to the six months of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 3% decrease in foreign currency translation impact and a 1% decrease in pricing, partially offset by a 2% increase in organic volume.
Gross profit increased $36.4 million or 22.7% in the second quarter and increased $72.6 million or 22.3% in the six months of fiscal 2020 compared to the comparable periods of fiscal 2019. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased 150 basis points and 140 basis points in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2020 compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019, respectively. This increase in the gross profit margin in both the second quarter and six months, is largely a function of declines in commodity costs relative to pricing, as well as the impact of Alpha's higher margins, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. 
Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 280 basis points and 240 basis points in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to the comparable periods of fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of the foreign currency translation, the increase in dollars reflects the inclusion of Alpha and the additional investments in new product development.
Restructuring, Exit and Other Charges
Included in our second quarter of fiscal 2020 operating results are restructuring charges of $0.5 million in the Americas and $0.3 million in Asia, all of which relate to improving operational efficiencies in the respective regions. Also included in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 operating results are non-cash exit charges of $0.7 million in EMEA, relating to the closure of our facility in Targovishte, Bulgaria. 
In keeping with our strategy of exiting the manufacture of batteries for diesel-electric submarines, during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we sold certain licenses and assets for $2.0 million and recorded a net gain of $0.9 million, which is reported as other exit charges.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we wrote off $5.5 million of assets at our Kentucky and Tennessee plants, as a result of our strategic product mix shift from traditional flooded batteries to maintenance free lead acid and lithium batteries.
On September 19, 2019, a fire broke out in the battery formation area of our Richmond, Kentucky motive power production facility. We maintain insurance policies for both property damage and business interruption and are in the early stages of assessing damage. Based on our initial assessment, we have written off $1.9 million for the damage caused to our fixed assets and inventories. We also recorded a receivable of $1.9 million, related to our initial claims for recovery from our property and casualty insurance carriers. 
Operating Earnings
Operating earnings decreased $4.6 million or 7.3% and decreased $0.5 million or 0.4% in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019. Operating earnings, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 190 basis points and 140 basis points in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019, primarily due to ERP execution challenges at our Richmond, Kentucky, facility which continued to result in missed sales opportunities and higher manufacturing costs as well as the decline in our organic volume across all the regions.
The Americas segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring, exit and other charges, decreased 250 basis points and 210 basis points in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019. The decrease 
The EMEA segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring and other exit charges, increased 50 basis points in the second quarter and remained flat in the six months of fiscal 2020, compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019 due to lower commodity costs offset by lower pricing.
The Asia segment's operating earnings, excluding restructuring charges, decreased 430 basis points and 260 basis points in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower organic volume caused by the slowdown in the Chinese economy. 
Interest Expense 
Interest expense of $10.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 (net of interest income of $0.6 million) was $3.7 million higher than the interest expense of $6.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 (net of interest income of $0.5 million). Interest expense of $21.0 million in the six months of fiscal 2020 (net of interest income of $1.1 million) was $8.1 million higher than the interest expense of $12.9 million in the six months of fiscal 2019 (net of interest income of $1.4 million).
The increase in interest expense in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2020 is primarily due to higher average debt. Our average debt outstanding was $1,059.8 million in both the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2020 compared to $628.3 million and $619.8 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019. The increased borrowings were primarily to fund the Alpha acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
Included in interest expense are non-cash charges for deferred financing fees of $0.4 million and $0.7 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2020 compared to $0.3 million and $0.6 million, in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019.
Other (Income) Expense, Net
Other (income) expense, net in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was expense of $0.2 million compared to income of $1.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Other (income) expense, net in the six months of fiscal 2020 was income of $1.0 million compared to income of $0.9 million in the six months of fiscal 2019. Foreign currency impact resulted in a loss of $0.2 million and a gain of $1.1 million, in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2020, respectively, compared to a foreign currency gain of $1.8 million and $2.2 million in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2019.
As a result of the above, earnings before income taxes in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased $9.8 million, or 16.9%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and decreased $8.5 million or 7.4%, in the six months of fiscal 2020, compared to the six months of fiscal 2019.
The consolidated effective income tax rates for the second quarters of fiscal 2020 and 2019 were (29.5)% and 18.6%, respectively and were (4.0)% and 19.1% for the six months of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The rate decrease in the second quarter and six months of fiscal 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Operating activities provided cash of $105.1 million in the six months of fiscal 2020 compared to $84.0 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2019. In the six months of fiscal 2020, cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net earnings of $111.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $41.1 million, non-cash charges relating to restructuring, exit and other charges of $10.0 million, stock-based compensation of $8.9 million, provision for doubtful debts of $3.2 million and non-cash interest of $0.8 million, partially offset by deferred taxes of $21.0 million resulting from the Swiss Tax Reform. Cash provided by earnings adjusted for non-cash items were partially offset by the increase in primary working capital of $6.9 million, net of currency translation changes. Accrued expenses decreased by $18.5 million primarily for payments of $7.3 million related to the German competition authority matter (See Note 10 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q) and $6.1 million paid to the seller in connection with the Alpha acquisition, for certain reimbursable pre-acquisition items. Prepaid and other current assets increased by $18.2 million, primarily due to contract assets of $8.0 million, $4.0 million receivable from the Seller (Alpha) and insurance receivable of $1.9 million relating to the Richmond plant claim. Other liabilities decreased by $10.0 million due to income taxes.
In the six months of fiscal 2019, cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net earnings of $93.4 million, depreciation and amortization of $27.3 million, stock-based compensation of $9.1 million, non-cash charges relating to write-off of assets of $1.1 million, non-cash interest of $0.6 million and provision for deferred taxes of $0.8 million. Cash provided by earnings as adjusted for non-cash items were partially offset by the increase in primary working capital of $22.3 million, net of currency translation changes, and an outflow of $4.2 million relating to prepaid assets and $20.6 million relating to accrued expenses for income tax payments. 
As explained in the discussion of our use of “non-GAAP financial measures,” we monitor the level and percentage of primary working capital to sales. Primary working capital for this purpose is trade accounts receivable, plus inventories, minus trade accounts payable. The resulting net amount is divided by the trailing three month net sales (annualized) to derive a primary working capital percentage. Primary working capital was $815.3 million (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 26.7%) at September 29, 2019, $835.6 million (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 26.2%) at March 31, 2019 and $666.0 million at September 30, 2018 (yielding a primary working capital percentage of 25.2%). The primary working capital percentage of 26.7% at September 29, 2019 is 50 basis points higher than that for March 31, 2019, and 150 basis points higher than that for the prior year period. The increase in primary working capital compared to the prior year period is primarily due to the inclusion of the Alpha primary working capital components, while the increase of 50 basis points increase from March 31, 2019 is primarily due to the build up of inventories partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and payable, due to lower seasonal sales. 
Investing activities used cash of $40.7 million in the six months of fiscal 2020 which primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $43.4 million, relating to plant improvements.
Investing activities used cash of $35.3 million in the six months of fiscal 2019 and primarily consisted of capital expenditures relating to plant improvements.
Financing activities provided cash of $68.8 million in the six months of fiscal 2020. During the six months of fiscal 2020, we borrowed $285.0 million under the Amended 2017 Revolver and repaid $135.0 million of the Amended 2017 Revolver. Repayment on the Amended 2017 Term Loan was $5.6 million and net payments on short-term debt were $20.0 million. Treasury stock open market purchases were $34.6 million, payment of cash dividends to our stockholders were $14.9 million and payment of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards were $6.2 million. 
Financing activities provided cash of $6.8 million in the six months of fiscal 2019. During the six months of fiscal 2019, we borrowed $84.5 million under the 2017 Revolver and repaid $65.0 million. Payment of cash dividends to our stockholders were $14.7 million and payment of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards were $3.4 million. Proceeds from stock options were $8.3 million and net payments on short-term debt were $2.9 million. 
Currency translation had a negative impact of $7.5 million on our cash balance in the six months of fiscal 2020 compared to a negative impact of $32.5 million in the six months of fiscal 2019. In the six months of fiscal 2020, principal currencies in which we do business such as the Euro, Swiss franc, Polish zloty and British Pound weakened versus the U.S. dollar. 
As a result of the above, total cash and cash equivalents increased by $125.6 million to $424.8 million, in the six months of fiscal 2020 compared to an increase by $23.1 million to $545.2 million, in the comparable period of fiscal 2019.
Debt and Compliance with Debt Covenants
In fiscal 2019, we amended our then existing credit facility (as amended, the “Amended Credit Facility”). The Amended Credit Facility consists of $449.1 million senior secured term loans (the “Amended 2017 Term Loan”), including a CAD 133.0 million ($99.1 million) term loan and a $700.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Amended 2017 Revolver”). The Amended Credit Facility has a maturity date of September 30, 2022.
During the current quarter, we borrowed on the Amended 2017 Revolver and repatriated additional funds from our international subsidiaries to finance the acquisition of NorthStar, which was completed subsequent to the end of the quarter.
All obligations under our Amended Credit Facility are secured by, among other things, substantially all of our U.S. assets. The Amended Credit Facility contains various covenants which, absent prepayment in full of the indebtedness and other obligations, or the receipt of waivers, limit our ability to conduct certain specified business transactions, buy or sell assets out of the ordinary course of business, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, pay dividends and take certain other actions. There are no prepayment penalties on loans under this credit facility.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
A table of our obligations is contained in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Obligations of our 2019 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2019. As of September 29, 2019, except for presentation changes resulting from the adoption of ASC 842 effective our first quarter of fiscal 2020, we had no significant changes to our contractual obligations table contained in our 2019 Annual Report.
