Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
•to adopt the optional transition method defined within ASU 2018-11 and not restate comparative prior periods but instead recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption;
•the package of three practical expedients addressing whether a contract contains a lease, lease classification and initial direct costs;
•to combine lease and non-lease components as a single component for all asset classes;
•to use a portfolio approach to determine the incremental borrowing rate; and 
•to apply the short-term lease exception to leases that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. 
Upon adoption, the Company recorded Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities of approximately $84,878 and $87,248, respectively. In addition, capital lease assets and liabilities are now classified as finance lease right-of-use assets and liabilities. The difference between the operating lease assets and lease liabilities primarily relates to unamortized lease incentives and deferred rent recorded in accordance with the previous lease guidance.
The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” on April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. There was no cumulative effect of adopting the standard at the date of initial application in retained earnings. 
The Company's revenues by reportable segments are presented in Note 17. 
A small portion of the Company's customer arrangements oblige the Company to create customized products for its customers that require the bundling of both products and services into a single performance obligation because the individual products and services that are required to fulfill the customer requirements do not meet the definition for a distinct performance obligation. These customized products generally have no alternative use to the Company and the terms and conditions of these arrangements give the Company the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit margin. For these arrangements, control transfers over time and the Company measures progress towards completion by selecting the input or output method that best depicts the transfer of control of the underlying goods and services to the customer for each respective arrangement. Methods used by the Company to measure progress toward completion include labor hours, costs incurred and units of production. Revenues recognized over time for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 amounted to $33,595 and $16,491, respectively. Revenues recognized over time for the six months of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 amounted to $75,090 and $34,895, respectively.
The Company leases manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, office space, vehicles and other equipment under non-cancellable leases with initial terms typically ranging from 1 to 17 years. At contract inception, the Company reviews the terms of the arrangement to determine if the contract is or contains a lease. Guidance in Topic 842 is used to evaluate whether the contract has an identified asset; if the Company has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the asset; and if it has the right to direct the use of the underlying asset. When determining if a contract has an identified asset, the Company considers both explicit and implicit assets, and whether the supplier has the right to substitute the asset. When determining if the Company has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the asset, the Company considers the primary outputs of the identified asset throughout the period of use and determines if it receives greater than 90% of those benefits. When determining if it has the right to direct the use of an underlying asset, the Company considers if it has the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use and if it controls the decision-making rights over the asset. 
Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. The Company exercises its judgment to determine the term of those leases when extension or termination options are present and include such options in the calculation of the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those options. 
The Company has elected to include both lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease payments for all asset classes. Payments made to a lessor for items such as taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, or other costs commonly referred to as executory costs, are also included in lease payments if they are fixed. The fixed portion of these payments are included in the calculation of the lease liability, while any variable portion would be recognized as variable lease expenses, when incurred. Variable payments made to third parties for these, or similar costs, such as utilities, are not included in the calculation of lease payments.
Both finance and operating leases are reflected as liabilities on the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term. As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company has exercised judgment in electing the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available when the lease commences to determine the present value of future payments. Right-of-use assets are valued at the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any initial direct costs or rent prepayments and reduced by any lease incentives and any deferred lease payments. 
Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense includes depreciation, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the leased asset, and interest expense, which is recognized following an effective interest rate method.
On December 7, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Alpha Technologies Services, Inc. (“ATS”) and Alpha Technologies Ltd. (“ATL”), resulting in ATS and ATL becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the “share purchase”). Additionally, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Alpha Technologies Inc. and certain assets of Altair Advanced Industries, Inc. and other affiliates of ATS and ATL (all such sellers, together with ATS and ATL, “Alpha”), in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain restructuring agreements (collectively, the “asset acquisition” and together with the share purchase, the “acquisition”). Based in Bellingham, Washington, Alpha is a global industry leader in comprehensive commercial-grade energy solutions for broadband, telecom, renewable, industrial and traffic customers around the world. The initial purchase consideration for the acquisition was $750,000, of which $650,000 was paid in cash and the balance was settled by issuing 1,177,630 shares of EnerSys common stock. These shares were issued out of the Company's treasury stock and were valued at $84.92 per share, which was based on the thirty-day volume weighted average stock price of the Company’s common stock at closing, in accordance with the purchase agreement. The 1,177,630 shares had a closing date fair value of $93,268, based upon the December 7, 2018 closing date spot rate of $79.20. The total purchase consideration, consisting of cash paid of $650,000, shares valued at $93,268 and an adjustment for working capital (due post - closing from seller of $766), was $742,502. The Company funded the cash portion of the acquisition with borrowings from the Amended Credit Facility as defined in Note 12. See Note 12 for additional information. 
The acquisition expands the Company's footprint in broadband and telecom markets. The goodwill recognized in connection with this transaction reflects the benefits the Company expects to realize from being able to provide a one-stop, fully integrated power solutions offering to its customers, as well as the benefit of cost synergies from alignment of the Alpha group within its own organizational structure.
The results of operations of Alpha have been included in the Company’s Americas segment. 
The following table represents the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulting goodwill. The amounts recognized will be finalized as the information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained, but no later than one year from the acquisition date (“the measurement period”).

Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships
Lead Forward Contracts
The Company enters into lead forward contracts to fix the price for a portion of its lead purchases. Management considers the lead forward contracts to be effective against changes in the cash flows of the underlying lead purchases. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. At September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company has hedged the price to purchase approximately 54.0 million pounds and 42.0 million pounds of lead, respectively, for a total purchase price of $49,938 and $39,218, respectively.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts
The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of the Company’s foreign currency exposures for lead, as well as other foreign currency exposures so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the underlying foreign currency denominated exposures. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. As of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company had entered into a total of $45,350 and $42,318, respectively, of such contracts.

Litigation and Other Legal Matters
European Competition Investigations 
Certain of the Company’s European subsidiaries had received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews from, and have had on-site inspections conducted by, the competition authorities of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands relating to conduct and anticompetitive practices of certain industrial battery participants. 
The Company settled the Belgian regulatory proceeding in February 2016 by acknowledging certain anticompetitive practices and conduct and agreeing to pay a fine of $1,962, which was paid in March 2016. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company also paid $1,272 towards certain aspects related to this matter, which are under appeal. As of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company did not have a reserve balance for these matters. 
In June 2017, the Company settled a portion of its previously disclosed proceeding involving the German competition authority relating to conduct involving the Company's motive power battery business and agreed to pay a fine of $14,811, which was paid in July 2017. As of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company did not have a reserve balance relating to this matter. Also, in March 2019, the Company settled the remaining portion of its previously disclosed proceeding involving the German competition authority relating to conduct involving the Company’s reserve power battery business and agreed to pay a fine of $7,258, which was paid in April 2019. As of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 and $7,258, respectively.
As a result of its operations, the Company is subject to various federal, state, and local, as well as international environmental laws and regulations and is exposed to the costs and risks of registering, handling, processing, storing, transporting, and disposing of hazardous substances, especially lead and acid. The Company’s operations are also subject to federal, state, local and international occupational safety and health regulations, including laws and regulations relating to exposure to lead in the workplace. 
The Company is responsible for certain cleanup obligations at the former Yuasa battery facility in Sumter, South Carolina, that predates its ownership of this facility. This manufacturing facility was closed in 2001 and the Company established a reserve for this facility, which was $1,060 and $1,081 as of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, respectively. Based on current information, the Company’s management believes this reserve is adequate to satisfy the Company’s environmental liabilities at this facility. This facility is separate from the Company’s current metal fabrication facility in Sumter.
Lead and Foreign Currency Forward Contracts
To stabilize its lead costs and reduce volatility from currency movements, the Company enters into contracts with financial institutions. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. Please refer to Note 7 - Derivative Financial Instruments for more details. 
11. Restructuring, Exit and Other Charges
Restructuring Plans
Exit Charges
During fiscal 2019, the Company committed to a plan to close its facility in Targovishte, Bulgaria, which produced diesel-electric submarine batteries. Management determined that the future demand for batteries of diesel-electric submarines was not sufficient given the number of competitors in the market. Of the estimated total charges of $30,000 for all these actions, the Company had recorded charges amounting to $20,242 in fiscal 2019, relating to severance and inventory and fixed asset write-offs. The Company recorded an additional $1,325 relating to non-cash charges during the six months of fiscal 2020. 
In keeping with its strategy of exiting the manufacture of batteries for diesel-electric submarines, during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company also sold certain licenses and assets for $2,031 and recorded a net gain of $892, which is reported in exit charges.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company wrote off $5,441 of assets at its Kentucky and Tennessee plants, as a result of its strategic product mix shift from traditional flooded batteries to maintenance free lead acid and lithium batteries.
During the six months of fiscal 2019, as part of the aforementioned program to convert its India operations from mainly reserve power production to motive power production the Company also recorded a non-cash write-off of reserve power inventories of $526, which was reported in cost of goods sold.
On September 19, 2019, a fire broke out in the battery formation area of the Company's Richmond, Kentucky motive power production facility. The Company maintains insurance policies for both property damage and business interruption and is in the early stages of assessing damage. Based on its initial assessment, the Company has written off $1,934 for the damage caused to its fixed assets and inventories. The Company also recorded a receivable of $1,934 related to its initial claims for recovery from its property and casualty insurance carriers. 
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per annum and have an original face value of $300,000. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on April 30 and October 30 of each year and commenced on October 30, 2015. The Notes will mature on April 30, 2023, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased in full. The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the “Guarantees”), jointly and severally, by certain of its subsidiaries that are guarantors (the “Guarantors”) under the Amended Credit Facility. The Guarantees are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Guarantors.
2017 Credit Facility and Subsequent Amendment
In fiscal 2018, the Company entered into a credit facility (the “2017 Credit Facility”). The 2017 Credit Facility scheduled to mature on September 30, 2022, comprised a $600,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (“2017 Revolver”) and a $150,000 senior secured term loan (“2017 Term Loan”). The Company utilized the borrowings from the 2017 Credit Facility to repay its pre-existing credit facility. 
In fiscal 2019, the Company amended the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the “Amended Credit Facility”) to fund the Alpha acquisition. The Amended Credit Facility consists of $449,105 senior secured term loans (the “Amended 2017 Term Loan”), including a CAD 133,050 ($99,105) term loan and a $700,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Amended 2017 Revolver”). The amendment resulted in an increase of the 2017 Term Loan and the 2017 Revolver by $299,105 and $100,000, respectively.
As of September 29, 2019, the Company had $389,000 outstanding under the Amended 2017 Revolver and $433,625 under the Amended 2017 Term Loan. 
The Amended Credit Facility allows for up to two temporary increases in the maximum leverage ratio from 3.50x to 4.00x for a four quarter period following an acquisition larger than $250,000. Effective December 7, 2018 through December 27, 2019, the maximum leverage ratio has been increased to 4.00x.
The current portion of the Amended 2017 Term Loan of $33,888 is classified as long-term debt as the Company expects to refinance the future quarterly payments with revolver borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility.
Short-Term Debt
As of September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019, the Company had $34,351 and $54,490, respectively, of short-term borrowings. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was approximately 4% at September 29, 2019 and March 31, 2019.
