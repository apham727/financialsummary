Legal Proceedings



We are or may be involved in various legal proceedings from time to time arising from the normal course of business.
Item 1A.
Risk Factors



A discussion of our risk factors can be found in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
The risks described below and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face.
The transfer of certain Test production operations in China to our new contract manufacturing partner may be subject to delays, increased costs or other unanticipated consequences.
On March 13, 2018, we announced workforce reductions and manufacturing facility closures in our Test segment corresponding to the transfer of certain production operations in China to a contract manufacturing partner.
These changes are designed to increase organizational effectiveness, gain manufacturing efficiencies and provide cost savings that can be reinvested in growth initiatives.
We can make no assurances that our current estimates of costs and timing of this restructuring action will be accurate or that additional costs will not be incurred as we continue the restructuring action.
For further information on restructuring actions, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
While we believe our China contract manufacturing partner to be qualified to manufacture our Test segment products, we may need to address short-term quality and delivery issues.
The final impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could be materially different from our current estimates.
The Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017.
The tax benefit recorded for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 involves significant judgment and assumptions as to the impact of the Tax Act.
Our estimated impact of the new law is based on management's current knowledge and assumptions.
We expect to record any adjustments within one year of the enactment of the Tax Act in accordance with the guidance provided in Accounting Standards Update No.
2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (SAB 118), and these adjustments could be material.

Per the Capped Call Agreements, the outstanding Capped Calls will automatically settle upon expiration on July 1, 2019.
