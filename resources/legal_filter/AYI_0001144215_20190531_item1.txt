Note 3 — Acquisitions and Investments



No acquisitions were completed during the first nine months of fiscal 2019.
The following discussion relates to acquisitions completed during fiscal 2018.
IOTA Engineering, LLC



On May 1, 2018, using cash on hand and borrowings available under existing credit arrangements, we acquired all of the equity interests of IOTA Engineering, LLC (“IOTA”).
IOTA is headquartered in Tucson, Arizona and manufactures highly engineered emergency lighting products and power equipment for commercial and institutional applications both in the U.S. and international markets.
Lucid Design Group, Inc.



On February 12, 2018, using cash on hand, we acquired all of the equity interests of Lucid Design Group, Inc (“Lucid”).
Lucid is headquartered in Oakland, California and provides a data and analytics platform to make data-driven decisions to improve building efficiency and drive energy conservation and savings.
Accounting for Fiscal 2018 Acquisitions



Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred.
The aggregate purchase price of these acquisitions reflects total goodwill and identified intangible assets of approximately $76.8 million and $81.8 million, respectively, as of May 31, 2019.
Identified intangible assets consist of indefinite-lived marketing-related intangibles as well as definite-lived customer-based and technology-based assets, which have a weighted average useful life of approximately 14 years.
As of May 31, 2019, we have finalized the acquisition accounting for Lucid and IOTA.
Note 4 — New Accounting Pronouncements



Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2019



ASU 2017-01 -— Clarifying the Definition of a Business



In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business (“ASU 2017-01”), which requires an evaluation of whether substantially all of the fair value of assets obtained in an acquisition is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets.
If so, the transaction does not qualify as a business.
The guidance also requires an acquired business to include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs.
We adopted ASU 2017-01 effective September 1, 2018 and applied the guidance prospectively.
ASU 2016-15 — Statement of Cash Flows



In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (“ASU 2016-15”), which is intended to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
These cash flows include debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance.
We adopted ASU 2016-15 effective September 1, 2018 and applied the changes retrospectively.
We maintain life insurance policies on certain former employees primarily to satisfy obligations under certain deferred compensation plans.
As required by the standard, proceeds from these policies are now classified as cash inflows from investing activities.
We received $0.8 million and $1.0 million from corporate-owned life insurance policies during the nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
As such, cash flows from operations for the nine months ended May 31, 



5

ACUITY BRANDS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)



2018 decreased $1.0 million, with a corresponding increase to cash flows from investing activities, compared to amounts previously reported.
The remaining provisions of ASU 2016-15 did not impact our financial statements for the periods presented.
ASU 2017-07 — Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost



In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-07, Compensation — Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”), which changes the presentation of net periodic pension cost related to employer sponsored defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits.
Additionally, only service costs may be capitalized in assets.
We adopted ASU 2017-07 effective as of September 1, 2018.
As a practical expedient, we used amounts previously disclosed in the Pension and Defined Contribution Plans footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within our Form 10-K as the basis for retrospective application because amounts capitalized in inventory at a given point in time are de minimis and determining these amounts was impractical.
Upon adoption of ASU 2017-07, our previously reported Operating profit for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 increased $1.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively, with a corresponding increase to Miscellaneous expense (income), net.
The provisions of ASU 2017-07 have no impact to our net income or earnings per share.
The impact of the provisions of ASU 2017-07 on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 are as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



ASC 606 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers



In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”), which replaced the existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP.
Since the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB released several amendments to improve and clarify the implementation guidance, as well as to change the effective date.
These standards have been collectively codified within Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).
ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
We adopted ASC 606 effective September 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method and recognized a cumulative effect of applying ASC 606 of $13.0 million in Retained earnings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of this date.
We applied the standard to all contracts as of the transition date.
Information for prior years presented has not been restated and continues to reflect the authoritative accounting standards in effect for those periods.
2018-15, Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”), which will require customers to apply internal-use software guidance to determine the implementation costs that are able to be capitalized.
Capitalized implementation costs will be required to be amortized over the term of the arrangement, beginning when the cloud computing arrangement is ready for its intended use.
ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2019.
The standard allows changes to be applied either retrospectively or prospectively.
We will adopt the standard as required in fiscal 2021.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires an entity to assess impairment of its financial instruments based on its estimate of expected credit losses.
The provisions of ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2019.
Entities are required to apply these changes through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”), which requires lessees to include most leases on the balance sheet.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2018.
Since the issuance of ASU 2016-02, the FASB released several amendments to improve and clarify the implementation guidance, as well as to change the allowable adoption methods.
These standards have been collectively codified within ASC 842, Leases (“ASC 842”).
The standard allows entities to present the effects of the accounting change as either a cumulative adjustment as of the beginning of the earliest period presented or as of the date of adoption.
We have an implementation team tasked with reviewing our lease obligations and determining the impact of the new standard to our financial statements.
The team is also tasked with identifying appropriate changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard.
Currently, the implementation team has substantially completed its review of outstanding property and equipment leases, which represent our primary outstanding lease obligations.
The team is in the process of reviewing and analyzing other contracts that may have ASC 842 impacts, including information technology contracts.
The implementation team reports its findings and progress of the project to management on a frequent basis and to

ACUITY BRANDS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)



the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.
Based on our current lease portfolio, we preliminarily expect ASC 842 to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets primarily related to the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities.
Further details regarding our undiscounted future lease payments as well as the timing of those payments are included within the Commitments and Contingencies footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within our Form 10-K. We will adopt the standard as required on September 1, 2019.
All other newly issued accounting pronouncements not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.
Note 5 — Revenue Recognition



We recognize revenue when we transfer control of goods and services to our customers.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for goods and services and is recognized net of allowances for rebates, sales incentives, product returns, and discounts to customers.
Payment is generally due and received within 60 days from the point of sale or prior to the transfer of control of certain goods and services.
No payment terms extend beyond one year, and we apply the practical expedient within ASC 606 to conclude that no significant financing terms exist within our contracts with customers.
Allowances for cash discounts to customers are estimated using the expected value method based on historical experience and are recorded as a reduction to sales.
At the time revenue is recognized, we record a refund liability for the expected value of future returns primarily based on historical experience, specific notification of pending returns, or based on contractual terms with the respective customers.
Such assets totaled $15.3 million and $16.4 million as of May 31, 2019 and September 1, 2018, respectively.
Costs associated with these programs are generally estimated based on the most likely amount expected to be settled based on the context of the individual contract and are reflected within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in accordance with ASC 606, which in most instances requires such costs to be recorded as reductions of revenue.
The refund liabilities associated with these programs totaled $31.8 million and $43.9 million as of May 31, 2019 and September 1, 2018, respectively, and are reflected within Other accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)



Nature of Goods and Services



Products



Approximately 95% of revenues for the periods presented were generated from short-term contracts with our customers to deliver tangible goods such as luminaires, lighting controllers, controllers for various building systems, power supplies, prismatic skylights, and drivers.
We record revenue from these contracts when the customer obtains control of those goods.
For sales designated free on board shipping point, control is transferred at the time of shipment.
For sales designated free on board destination, customers take control when a product is delivered to the customer’s delivery site.
Professional Services



We collect fees associated with training, installation, and technical support services, primarily related to the set up of our lighting solutions.
We recognize revenue for these one-time services at the time the service is performed.
We also sell certain service-type warranties that extend coverages for products beyond their base warranties.
Claims related to service-type warranties are expensed as incurred.
Software



Software sales include licenses for software, data usage fees, and software as a service arrangements, which generally extend for one year or less.
We recognize revenue for software based on the contractual rights provided to a customer, which typically results in the recognition of revenue ratably over the contractual service period.
Shipping and Handling Activities



We account for all shipping and handling activities as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer products to our customers.
Significant judgment may be required to determine which performance obligations are distinct and should be accounted for separately.
We allocate the expected consideration to be collected to each distinct performance obligation based on its standalone selling price.
Standalone selling price is generally determined using a cost plus margin valuation when no observable input is available.
The amount of consideration allocated to each performance obligation is recognized as revenue in accordance with the timing for products, professional services, and software as described above.
Contract Balances 



Our rights related to collections from customers are unconditional and are reflected within Accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Contract liabilities arise when we receive cash or an unconditional right to collect cash prior to the transfer of control of goods or services.
Current deferred revenues are included within Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
These services are expected to be performed within one year.
Non-current deferred revenues primarily consist of long-term service-type warranties, which are typically recognized ratably as revenue between five and ten years from the date of sale, and are included 



9

ACUITY BRANDS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)



within Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Revenue recognized from beginning balances of contract liabilities during the nine months ended May 31, 2019 totaled $3.7 million.
Unsatisfied performance obligations that do not represent contract liabilities consist primarily of orders for physical goods that have not yet been shipped.
Accordingly, a comparison of backlog orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of future shipments.
Disaggregated Revenues



Our lighting and building management solutions are sold primarily through independent sales agents who cover specific geographic areas and market channels, by internal sales representatives, through consumer retail channels, and directly to large corporate accounts.
The following table shows revenue from contracts with customers by sales channel for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements



We determine fair value measurements based on the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability.
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), establishes a three level hierarchy making a distinction between market participant assumptions based on (i) unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market (Level 1), (ii) quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (Level 2), and (iii) prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement (Level 3).
Our cash and cash equivalents (Level 1), which are required to be carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis, were $333.7 million and $129.1 million as of May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018, respectively.
We utilize valuation methodologies to determine the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities in conformity with the concepts of “exit price” and the fair value hierarchy as prescribed in ASC 820.
All valuation methods and assumptions are validated at least quarterly to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the fair values.
There were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values during the current period.
We used quoted market prices to determine the fair value of Level 1 assets and liabilities.
No transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy occurred during the current fiscal period.
In the event of a transfer in or out of a level within the fair value hierarchy, the transfers would be recognized on the date of occurrence.
Disclosures of fair value information about financial instruments (whether or not recognized in the balance sheet), for which it is practicable to estimate that value, are required each reporting period in addition to any financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis as prescribed by ASC 825, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825”).
In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.
Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.
Fair value is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity (Level 2).
The industrial revenue bond is carried at the outstanding balance as of the end of the reporting period.
The industrial revenue bond is a tax-exempt, variable-rate instrument that resets on a weekly basis; therefore, we estimate that the face amount of the bond approximates fair value as of May 31, 2019 based on bonds of similar terms and maturity (Level 2).
The bank loans are carried at the outstanding balance as of the end of the reporting period.
Fair value is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity (Level 2).
ASC 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements.
Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value to us.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names that are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.
We recorded amortization expense of $7.7 million and $7.2 million during the three months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $23.1 million and $20.5 million during the nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Amortization expense is generally recorded on a straight-line basis and is expected to be approximately $30.7 million in fiscal 2019, $30.7 million in fiscal 2020, $27.9 million in fiscal 2021, $27.0 million in fiscal 2022, and $25.8 million in fiscal 2023.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018 are summarized below (in millions):

Note 12 — Debt and Lines of Credit



Lines of Credit



On June 29, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks that provides us with a $400.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) and a $400.0 million unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (“Term Loan Facility”).
We had no borrowings outstanding under the current Revolving Credit Facility or Term Loan Facility as of May 31, 2019.
Additionally, we had no borrowings outstanding under our previous credit facility as of August 31, 2018.
Generally, amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility allow for borrowings to bear interest at either the Eurocurrency Rate or the base rate at our option, plus an applicable margin.
Eurocurrency Rate advances can be denominated in a variety of currencies, including U.S.
Dollars, and amounts outstanding bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or screen rate for the applicable currency plus an applicable margin.
The Eurocurrency applicable margin is based on our leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, with such margin ranging from 1.000% to 1.375%.
Base rate advances bear interest at an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin.
The base rate applicable margin is based on our leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, with such margin ranging from 0.000% to 0.375%.
The Term Loan Facility allows for borrowings to be drawn over a period ending December 31, 2019, utilizing up to four separate installments, which are U.S. dollar denominated.
Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will amortize in equal quarterly installments of 2.5% per year in year one, 2.5% per year in year two, 5.0% per year in year three, 5.0% per year in year four, and 7.5% per year in year five.
Any remaining borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are due and payable in full on June 29, 2023.
The Term Loan Facility allows for borrowings to bear interest at either a Eurocurrency Rate or the base rate, at our option, in each case plus an applicable margin.
Eurocurrency Rate advances can be denominated in a variety of currencies, including U.S.
Dollars, and amounts outstanding bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to the LIBOR or screen rate for the applicable currency plus an applicable margin.
The Eurocurrency applicable margin is based on our leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, with such margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.250%.
Base Rate advances bear interest at an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin.
The base rate applicable margin is based on our leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, with such margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.25%.
We are required to pay certain fees in connection with the Credit Agreement, including administrative service fees and annual facility fees.
The annual facility fee is payable quarterly, in arrears, and is determined by our leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement.
The facility fee ranges from 0.125% to 0.25% of the aggregate $800.0 million commitment of the lenders under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants, including a minimum interest expense coverage ratio (“Minimum Interest Expense Coverage Ratio”) and a leverage ratio (“Maximum Leverage Ratio”) of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement.
These ratios are computed at the end of each fiscal quarter for the most recent 12-month period.
The Credit Agreement generally allows for a Minimum Interest Expense Coverage Ratio of 2.50 and a Maximum Leverage Ratio of 3.50, subject to certain conditions, as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement.
We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of May 31, 2019.
At May 31, 2019, we had additional borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement of $794.7 million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the time, which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility less the outstanding letters of credit of $5.3 million issued under the Revolving Credit Facility.
As of May 31, 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $9.5 million, primarily for securing collateral requirements under our casualty insurance programs and for providing credit support for our industrial revenue bond, which includes the $5.3 million issued under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Long-term Debt



At May 31, 2019, we had $350.0 million of publicly-traded, senior unsecured notes outstanding at a 6% interest rate that are scheduled to mature in December 2019 (the “Unsecured Notes”).
Although the Unsecured Notes will mature within one year from May 31, 2019, we have the ability and intent to refinance these borrowings using availability under our Term Loan Facility, subject to satisfying the applicable conditions precedent.
Currently, we plan to refinance the Unsecured Notes in full at maturity with borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, of which $341.1 million of the current carrying value of the Unsecured Notes would be due more than one year from the anticipated refinancing date.
As such, this amount is reflected within Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2019.
We also had $4.0 million of tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds that are scheduled to mature in 2021 and $2.8 million

outstanding under fixed-rate bank loans outstanding at May 31, 2019.
Further discussion of our long-term debt is included within the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within our Form 10-K. 



Interest Expense, net



Interest expense, net, is comprised primarily of interest expense on long-term debt, obligations in connection with non-qualified retirement benefits, and Revolving Credit Facility borrowings, partially offset by interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents.
The following table summarizes the components of interest expense, net for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):

Note 13 — Commitments and Contingencies



In the normal course of business, we are subject to the effects of certain contractual stipulations, events, transactions, and laws and regulations that may, at times, require the recognition of liabilities, such as those related to self-insurance reserves and claims, legal and contractual issues, environmental laws and regulations, guarantees, and indemnities.
Product Warranty and Recall Costs 



Our products generally have a standard warranty term of five years that assure our products comply with agreed upon specifications.
Estimated future warranty and recall costs are primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty and recall claims.

Refer to the New Accounting Pronouncements and Revenue Recognition footnotes for additional information.
On February 20, 2018, a different shareholder filed a second class action complaint in the same venue against the same parties on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our stock between October 15, 2015 and April 3, 2017.
The cases were transferred on April 30, 2018, to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia and subsequently were consolidated as In re Acuity Brands, Inc. Securities Litigation, Civil Action No.
1:18-cv-02140-MHC (N.D. Ga.).
On October 5, 2018, the court-appointed lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended class action complaint (the “Consolidated Complaint”), which supersedes the initial complaints.
The plaintiff seeks class certification, unspecified monetary damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees.
We have filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint.
We maintain Director and Officer insurance policies that may cover any liability arising out of this litigation up to the policies’ limits, subject to a self-insured retention and other terms and conditions.
However, we cannot make a meaningful estimate of actual costs to be incurred that could possibly be higher or lower than the amounts reserved.
Trade Compliance Matters



In the course of routine reviews of import and export activity, we previously determined that we misclassified and/or inaccurately valued certain international shipments of products.

Note 18 — Supplemental Guarantor Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements



In December 2009, ABL, the 100% owned and principal operating subsidiary of Acuity Brands, refinanced the then current outstanding debt through the issuance of the Unsecured Notes.
See Debt and Lines of Credit footnote for further information.
In accordance with the registration rights agreement by and between ABL and the guarantors to the Unsecured Notes and the initial purchasers of the Unsecured Notes, ABL and the guarantors to the Notes filed a registration statement with the SEC for an offer to exchange the Unsecured Notes for an issue of SEC-registered notes with identical terms.
Due to the filing of the registration statement and offer to exchange, we determined the need for compliance with Rule 3-10 of SEC Regulation S-X (“Rule 3-10”).
In lieu of providing separate audited financial statements for ABL and ABL IP Holding, we have included the accompanying Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements in accordance with Rule 3-10(d) of SEC Regulation S-X since the Unsecured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Acuity Brands and ABL IP Holding.
The column marked “Parent” represents the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of Acuity Brands.
The column marked “Subsidiary Issuer” represents the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of ABL.
The column entitled “Subsidiary Guarantor” represents the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of ABL IP Holding.
Lastly, the column listed as “Non-Guarantors” includes the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the non-guarantor direct and indirect subsidiaries of Acuity Brands, which consist primarily of foreign subsidiaries.
Consolidating adjustments were necessary in order to arrive at consolidated amounts.
In addition, the equity method of accounting was used to calculate investments in subsidiaries.
Accordingly, this basis of presentation is not intended to present the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows for any purpose other than to comply with the specific requirements for parent-subsidiary guarantor reporting.
