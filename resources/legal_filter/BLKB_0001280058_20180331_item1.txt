Basis of Presentation



Unaudited interim consolidated financial statements



The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for interim financial reporting.
The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations for interim reporting of the SEC.
In order to provide comparability between periods presented, those amounts of revenue have been combined within "recurring" revenue in the previously reported consolidated statements of comprehensive income to conform to presentation of the current period.
Basis of consolidation



The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Blackbaud, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements



In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASU 2014-09"), which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
ASU 2014-09 replaces most previous revenue recognition guidance in GAAP and requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts.
We adopted ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2018 utilizing the full retrospective method of transition, which requires that the standard be applied to all periods presented.
The impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on our total revenues for 2017 and 2016 was not material.
Under the new standard, we defer all incremental commission and related fringe benefit costs to obtain a contract and amortize these costs in a manner that aligns with the expected period of benefit.
We utilized the 'portfolio approach' practical expedient in ASC 606-10-10-4, which allows entities to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics because the effects on the financial statements of this approach would not differ materially from applying the guidance to individual contracts.
We do not generally pay commissions for contract renewals.
Select adjusted unaudited financial statement information, which reflects our adoption of ASU 2014-09 is set forth below.

(Unaudited)



Our adoption of ASU 2014-09 had no impact on our net cash provided by or used in operating, investing or financing activities for any of the periods reported.
Except for the accounting policies for revenue recognition and deferred commissions (herein referred to as "costs of obtaining contracts") that were updated as a result of adopting ASU 2014-09, there have been no changes to our significant accounting policies described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2018, that have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Summary of significant accounting policies



Revenue Recognition



Our revenue is primarily generated from the following sources: (i) charging for the use of our software solutions in cloud-based and hosted environments; (ii) providing payment and transaction services; (iii) providing software maintenance and support services; and (iv) providing professional services, including implementation, consulting, training, analytic and other services.
Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.
We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: 



•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;



•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;



•Determination of the transaction price;



•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and



•Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
Therefore, recurring revenue is generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term, beginning on the date that the solution or service is made available to the customer.
Our recurring revenue contracts are generally for a term of three years at contract inception with one to three-year renewals thereafter, billed annually in advance and non-cancelable.
Recurring revenue is comprised of fees for the use of our subscription-based software solutions, which includes providing access to cloud-based solutions, hosting services, online training programs, subscription-based analytic services, such as donor acquisitions and data enrichment, and payment services.
Recurring revenue also includes fees from maintenance services for our on-premises solutions, services included in our renewable subscription contracts, subscription-based contracts for professional services and variable transaction revenue associated with the use of our solutions.
Our payment services are offered with the assistance of third-party vendors.
In general, when we are the principal in a transaction based on the factors identified in ASC 606-10-55-36 through 55-40, we record the revenue and related costs on a gross basis.
For payment and transaction services, we have the right to invoice the customer in an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the customer of our performance to date.
Therefore, we recognize revenue for these services over time based on the amount billable to the customer in accordance with the 'as invoiced' practical expedient in ASC 606-10-55-18.

Blackbaud, Inc.

One-time services and other



One-time services and other revenue primarily consists of fees for one-time consulting, analytic and onsite training services.
We generally bill consulting services based on hourly rates plus reimbursable travel-related expenses.
Fixed price consulting engagements are generally billed as milestones towards completion are reached.
Revenue for all consulting services is recognized over time as the services are performed.
We generally recognize analytic services revenue from donor prospect research engagements, the sale of lists of potential donors, data enrichment engagements and benchmarking studies at a point in time (upon delivery).
Contracts with multiple performance obligations



Some of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations.
For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct.
The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis.
Standalone selling prices of our solutions and services are typically estimated based on observable transactions when the solutions or services are sold on a standalone basis.
Costs of obtaining contracts, contract assets and deferred revenue



We pay sales commissions at the time contracts with customers are signed or shortly thereafter, depending on the size and duration of the sales contract.
These costs are deferred and then amortized in a manner that aligns with the expected period of benefit, which we have determined to be five years.
We do not generally pay commissions for contract renewals.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02").
ASU 2016-02 will require lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses in the income statement in a manner similar to current guidance.
The updated guidance also eliminates certain real estate-specific provisions and changes the guidance on sale-leaseback transactions, initial direct costs and lease executory costs for all entities.
For lessors, the standard modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases.
All entities will classify leases to determine how to recognize lease-related revenue and expense.
Classification will continue to affect amounts that lessors record on the balance sheet.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years.
Early adoption is permitted.
Upon adoption, entities will be required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements.
The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply.
We expect ASU 2016-02 will impact our consolidated financial statements and are currently evaluating the extent of the impact that implementation of this standard will have on adoption.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets



The change in goodwill during the three months ended March 31, 2018, consisted of the following:

Earnings Per Share



We compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share reflect the assumed exercise, settlement and vesting of all dilutive securities using the “treasury stock method” except when the effect is anti-dilutive.
Potentially dilutive securities consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, settlement of stock appreciation rights and vesting of restricted stock awards and units.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

5.
Fair Value Measurements



We use a three-tier fair value hierarchy to measure fair value.
This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:



•Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; 



•Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and



•Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
Recurring fair value measurements



Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following, as of the dates indicated below:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Our derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are required to be recorded at fair value.
Our derivative instruments that are recorded at fair value include interest rate swaps.
The fair value of our interest rate swaps was based on model-driven valuations using LIBOR rates, which are observable at commonly quoted intervals.
Accordingly, our interest rate swaps are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
We believe the carrying amount of our debt approximates its fair value at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, as the debt bears interest rates that approximate market value.
As LIBOR rates are observable at commonly quoted intervals, our debt is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
We did not transfer any assets or liabilities among the levels within the fair value hierarchy during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Additionally, we did not hold any Level 3 assets or liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2018.

Non-recurring fair value measurements



Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include intangible assets and goodwill, which are recognized at fair value during the period in which an acquisition is completed, from updated estimates and assumptions during the measurement period, or when they are considered to be impaired.
These non-recurring fair value measurements, primarily for intangible assets acquired, are based on Level 3 unobservable inputs.
In the event of an impairment, we determine the fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets using a discounted cash flow approach, which contains significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement.
The unobservable inputs in the analysis generally include future cash flow projections and a discount rate.
There were no non-recurring fair value adjustments to intangible assets and goodwill during the three months ended March 31, 2018, except for an insignificant business combination accounting adjustment to the initial fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date from updated information obtained during the measurement period.
See Note 3 to these consolidated financial statements for additional details.
The measurement period of a business combination may be up to one year from the acquisition date.
We record any measurement period adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill.

Derivative Instruments



Cash flow hedges



We generally use derivative instruments to manage our variable interest rate risk.
In July 2017, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "July 2017 Swap Agreement"), which effectively converts portions of our variable rate debt under our credit facility to a fixed rate for the term of the July 2017 Swap Agreement.
The notional value of the July 2017 Swap Agreement was $150.0 million with an effective date beginning in July 2017 through July 2021.
We designated the July 2017 Swap Agreement as a cash flow hedge at the inception of the contract.
In February 2018, we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement (the "February 2018 Swap Agreement"), which effectively converts portions of our variable rate debt under our credit facility to a fixed rate for the term of the February 2018 Swap Agreement.
The notional value of the February 2018 Swap Agreement was $50.0 million with an effective date beginning in February 2018 through June 2021.
We designated the February 2018 Swap Agreement as a cash flow hedge at the inception of the contract.
The fair values of our derivative instruments were as follows as of:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The effects of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Our policy requires that derivatives used for hedging purposes be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract.
Changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments and the related income tax expense or benefit are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the actual hedged expense is incurred or until the hedge is terminated at which point the unrealized gain (loss) is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to current earnings.
There were no ineffective portions of our interest rate swap derivatives during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.

Commitments and Contingencies 



Leases



Total rent expense was $4.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
Other commitments



The term loans under the 2017 Credit Facility require periodic principal payments.
The balance of the term loans and any amounts drawn on the revolving credit loans are due upon maturity of the 2017 Credit Facility in June 2022.
In certain cases, these arrangements require a minimum annual purchase commitment by us.
As of March 31, 2018, the remaining aggregate minimum purchase commitment under these arrangements was approximately $68.7 million through 2023.
We have not identified any losses and, accordingly, we have not recorded a liability related to these indemnifications.
Legal proceedings



We are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.
All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred.
Litigation is inherently unpredictable.

Most of our equity awards are granted during our first quarter and vest in subsequent years during the same quarter.
This discrete benefit to income tax expense relating to stock-based compensation during the three months ended March 31, 2018 was reduced as a result of the decrease in the U.S. corporate tax rate.
On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company obtained additional information affecting the provisional amount calculated for the transition tax as of December 31, 2017, however, the Company determined that the transition tax is still insignificant.
The Tax Act eliminates the exceptions for performance-based compensation and CFO compensation from the 162(m) calculation.
A transition rule allows for the grandfathering of performance-based compensation pursuant to a written binding contract in effect as of November 2, 2017.
While there is negative discretion inherent in our performance-based compensation plans, it is our position that the intent is for historic contracts to be written and binding.
Any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to tax expense in 2018 when the analysis is complete.

Dividends



Our Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy, which provides for the distribution to stockholders of a portion of cash generated by us that is in excess of operational needs and capital expenditures.
The 2017 Credit Facility limits the amount of dividends payable and certain state laws restrict the amount of dividends distributed.
In February 2018, our Board of Directors approved an annual dividend rate of $0.48 per share to be made in quarterly payments.
The following table provides information with respect to quarterly dividends of $0.12 per share paid on common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2018.

Our opening and closing balances of contract assets and deferred revenue were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Contract assets remained relatively unchanged during the first quarter of 2018.
The decrease in deferred revenue during the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to less billings for recurring revenue contracts.
The amount of revenue recognized during the first quarter of 2018 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period was approximately $123 million.
The amount of revenue recognized during the first quarter of 2018 from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was insignificant.
Disaggregation of revenue



We sell our cloud-based solutions and related services in two primary geographical markets: to customers in the United States, and to customers located outside of the United States.

Subsequent Events



Reeher acquisition



On April 30, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities, including all voting equity interests, of Reeher LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company (“Reeher”), pursuant to a securities purchase agreement.
The acquisition expands our fundraising performance management capabilities and is intended to drive more effective fundraising and greater social good outcomes for our customers.
We acquired the equity securities for an aggregate purchase price of $43.0 million, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the securities purchase agreement.
The purchase price and related expenses were funded primarily through borrowings under the 2017 Credit Facility.
As a result of the acquisition, Reeher has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we incurred insignificant acquisition-related expenses associated with the acquisition, which were recorded in general and administrative expense.
Due to the timing of the transaction, the initial accounting for this acquisition, including the measurement of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and goodwill, is not complete and is pending detailed analyses of the facts and circumstances that existed as of the April 30, 2018 acquisition date.
