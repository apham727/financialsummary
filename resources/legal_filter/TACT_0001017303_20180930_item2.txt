Results of Operations: Three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to three months ended September 30, 2017 



Net Sales.
Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales, as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 *  International sales do not include sales of printers and terminals made to domestic distributors or other domestic customers who may in turn ship those printers and terminals to international destinations.
Net sales for the third quarter of 2018 increased $314 thousand, or 2%, from the same period in 2017.
Printer and terminal sales volume increased 12% to approximately 42 thousand units for the third quarter of 2018, driven primarily by a 73% increase in unit volume from the casino and gaming market and, to a lesser extent, a 9% increase in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market.
International sales for the third quarter of 2018 increased $1.1 million, or 55%, from the same period in 2017 due primarily to a 58% increase in sales in the international casino and gaming market.
Restaurant Solutions: 



Revenue from the restaurant solutions market includes sales of terminals that combine hardware and software in a device that includes an operating system, touchscreen and one or two thermal print mechanisms that print easy-to-read food rotation labels, grab and go labels for prepared foods, and "enjoy by" date labels to help food service establishments and restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick-serve convenience and hospitality establishments) effectively manage food safety and automate and manage back-of-the-restaurant operations.
A summary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 was driven by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal due to lower sales to McDonald's.
This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our newer AccuDate XL2e terminal to three large corporate customers in support of large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal.
Shipments of AccuDate XL2e terminals exceeded sales of AccuDate 9700 terminals for the second consecutive quarter in the third quarter of 2018.
We expect full year 2018 sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to be relatively consistent with full year 2017 sales.
POS automation and banking: 



Revenue from the POS automation and banking market includes sales of thermal printers used primarily by restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick serve and hospitality establishments) located either at the checkout counter or within self-service kiosks to print receipts for consumers or print on linerless labels.
In addition, revenue includes sales of inkjet printers used by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to print deposit or withdrawal receipts and/or validate checks at bank teller stations.
A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



14 



   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in domestic POS automation and banking product revenue from the third quarter of 2017 was driven by a 22% increase in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald’s have returned to the near record levels experienced during 2017.
We expect this level of sales to McDonald’s to decrease during the fourth quarter of 2018.
This increase was partially offset by 81% lower domestic sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017.
International sales from our POS automation and banking products decreased during the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 due to lower sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer to our Canadian distributor for McDonald’s.
Casino and gaming: 



Revenue from the casino and gaming market includes sales of thermal ticket printers used in slot machines, video lottery terminals, and other gaming machines that print tickets or receipts instead of issuing coins at casinos and racetracks and other gaming venues worldwide.
Revenue from this market also includes sales of thermal roll-fed printers used in the international off-premise gaming market in gaming machines such as Amusement with Prizes, Skills with Prizes and Fixed Odds Betting Terminals at non-casino gaming establishments.
In addition, casino and gaming market revenue includes sales of the EPICENTRAL™ print system, our software solution (including annual software maintenance), that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them real-time at the slot machine.
A summary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due to an 79% increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer sales in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, driven primarily by a large order of replacement printers from a domestic casino operator, as well as increased sales to our OEMs.
These increases were partially offset by lower sales of our EPICENTRAL™ software systems as no new installations were completed during the third quarter of 2018 compared to two installations completed during the third quarter of 2017.
The increase in international sales of our casino and gaming products in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 was due to a 76% increase in sales of our thermal casino printers.
These increases were due to the success of the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor whose contract ended at the end of 2017 and included a large non-recurring order to an international OEM that we don’t expect to reoccur in the fourth quarter of 2018.
While we expect casino and gaming sales to increase in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, we do not expect domestic and international sales of our thermal casino printers to continue at the level experienced during the third quarter of 2018 for the remainder of 2018, as the third quarter results included two large orders that we do not expect to reoccur in 2018.
Lottery: 



Revenue from the lottery market includes sales of thermal on-line and other lottery printers primarily to International Game Technology and its subsidiaries ("IGT") and, to a lesser extent, other lottery system companies for various lottery applications.
We expect lottery printer sales to be lower for the full year 2018 compared to the full year 2017, as we have shifted our focus away from the lottery market to our higher-value, technology enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.
Printrex: 



Printrex branded printers are sold into markets that include wide format, desktop and rack mounted and vehicle mounted black/white thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field, seismic and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry.
It also includes high-speed color inkjet desktop printers used to print logs at the data centers of the oil and gas field service companies.
Revenue in this market also includes sales of vehicle mounted printers used to print schematics and certain other critical information in emergency services vehicles and other mobile printing applications.
A summary of sales of our worldwide Printrex printers for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in sales of Printrex printers in the third quarter of 2018 compared to third quarter of 2017 resulted from a 67% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers.
This increase was partially offset by 97% lower domestic and international sales of our medical and mobile printers in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017.
TSG: 



Revenue from TSG includes sales of consumable products (inkjet cartridges, ribbons, receipt paper, color thermal paper, food safety labels and other printing supplies), replacement parts, maintenance and repair services, testing services, refurbished printers, and shipping and handling charges.
A summary of sales in our worldwide TSG market for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the prior year period was due primarily to decreased replacement part sales and non-Printrex consumable product sales.
Replacement part sales decreased 44% due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
The decreases were partially offset by increased AccuDate label sales which quadrupled during the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased due to a 370% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, as sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers have increased upon the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor and using our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers.
16 



Gross Profit.
In the third quarter of 2018, gross profit increased $485 thousand, or 7%, compared to the same period in 2017 and our gross margin improved by 210 basis points to 50.5% in the third quarter of 2018.
The increase in gross profit was driven by 2% higher sales and a favorable product sales mix in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017.
We expect our full year gross margin to be higher for 2018 compared to the full year 2017, as our sales mix shifts towards higher-value, technology driven solutions in the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
Such expenses decreased $41 thousand, or 4% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 due primarily to lower contracted design expense to support new product development in the restaurant solutions market.
This decrease was partially offset by the hiring of additional engineering staff during 2018 to support new product developments in the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
We expect engineering, design and product development expenses to be higher for the full year 2018 compared to full year 2017, due to the expanded engineering staff to support new product development for the restaurant solutions market.
Operating Expenses - Selling and Marketing.
Such expenses decreased by $97 thousand, or 5%, in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 due primarily to the retirement of our EVP, Sales and Marketing in December 2017, whose position was replaced by an existing employee of TransAct, as well as the elimination of sales commission expense to our former international casino and gaming distributor, Suzo-Happ.
These decreases were somewhat offset by the hiring of additional sales staff in the U.K. to support our new direct selling model for the casino and gaming market in Europe.
17 



Operating Expenses - General and Administrative.
General and administrative expense information for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



General and administrative expenses primarily include salaries, incentive compensation, and other payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resource and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company.
General and administrative expenses remained consistent during the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 due to higher legal expenses being mostly offset by lower incentive compensation expenses incurred during 2018.
We expect general and administrative expenses to be higher in 2018 than 2017 due to recruiting expenses related to the expansion of our restaurant solutions sales staff, sales staff for our European casino and gaming market, and engineering staff.
Operating Income.
Operating income information for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Our operating income increased $621 thousand, or 24%, in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, and our operating margin increased to 20.3% of net sales largely due to higher gross profit resulting from an 2% increase in sales and a 210 basis point improvement in gross margin, as well as proportionately lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year period.
Interest expense, net.
We recorded net interest expense of $7 thousand in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $9 thousand in the third quarter of 2017.
We do not expect significant changes in net interest expense for the remainder of 2018.
Other expense, net.
We recorded other expense of $50 thousand in the third quarter of 2018 compared to no other income or expense recorded in the third quarter of 2017 due to higher foreign exchange losses recorded by our U.K. entity in the third quarter of 2018.
The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2018 was lower than the effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2017 due to the passage of the Tax Reform Act that was signed on December 22, 2017.
We expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20% for the full year 2018.
Net Income.
We reported net income for the third quarter of 2018 of $2.6 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $1.8 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2017.

Results of Operations: Nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2017 



Net Sales.
Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales, as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 *  International sales do not include sales of printers and terminals made to domestic distributors or other domestic customers who may in turn ship those printers and terminals to international destinations.
Net sales for the first nine months of 2018 decreased $285 thousand, or 1%, from the same period in 2017.
Although unit volume decreased in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017, the average selling price of our printers increased 9% during the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017, due primarily to the decreased volume of lottery printers which carry lower prices than our other products.
International sales increased $2 million, or 31%, primarily driven by 63% higher international sales in the casino and gaming market.
This increase was partially offset by a $1.1 million sales decrease in our international lottery market during the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017.
Restaurant solutions: 



A summary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 was driven by increased sales of our AccuDate XL2e to three large corporate customers in support of a large-scale, multi-quarter rollouts of the terminal.
This increase was partially offset by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to McDonald’s and our former U.S. distributor.
International restaurant solutions sales increased during the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 due to increased sales of the AccuDate 9700 for McDonald’s through our Asian distributor.
19 



POS automation and banking: 



A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking sales in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 was primarily driven by a 74% decrease in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers as we continue to deemphasize these products.
These decreases were partially offset by a slight increase in sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printers of 1% during the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017, as sales rebounded to prior year, near-record levels during the second and third quarters of 2018. 



International POS automation and banking sales decreased due to lower sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer to our Canadian distributor for McDonald’s during the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017.
Casino and gaming: 



A summary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due primarily to a 35% increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printer in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017, driven primarily by increased sales to our OEMs and a large order from a domestic casino operator for replacement printers in the third quarter of 2018.
These increases were partially offset by lower domestic sales of EPICENTRAL™ software which decreased 41% as we completed one new installation during the first nine months of 2018 compared to two new installations completed in the first nine months of 2017.
The increase in international sales in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 was due to a 98% increase of thermal casino printer sales and, to a lesser extent, a 9% increase in international sales of off-premise gaming printers.
These increases were due to the success of the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor and using our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers in Europe and included a large order to an international OEM in the third quarter of 2018.
The decrease in international lottery sales in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 was primarily due to a sale of lottery printers to IGT for the Canadian lottery in the first nine months of 2017 and no comparable sale occurring in the first nine months of 2018.
This increase was partially offset by 86% lower sales of domestic and international medical and mobile printers in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 as we shift our focus away from the medical and mobile markets to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.
TSG: 



A summary of sales in our worldwide TSG market for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG in the first nine months of 2018 as compared to the first nine months of 2017 was due primarily to lower sales of replacement parts, non-Printrex consumable products and service revenue.
Replacement part sales decreased 24% due to lower sales of lottery printer spare parts to IGT.
Service revenue declined 10% in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to paper testing sales that occurred in the 2017 period but did not repeat in the 2018 period.
These decreases were partially offset by increased AccuDate label sales which more than quadrupled in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017.
Internationally, TSG revenue increased primarily due to a 124% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017, as sales of replacement parts and accessories to international casino and gaming customers have increased upon the transition away from using our previous exclusive worldwide distributor and using our new direct sales team to sell to end user casino and gaming customers.

  ●  We reported net income of $4.5 million.
●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $739 thousand, and share-based compensation expense of $524 thousand.
●  Inventories increased $4.2 million, or 47%, due to the buildup of inventory on hand to support future anticipated sales in the casino and gaming and restaurant solutions markets.
●  Prepaid income taxes decreased $467 thousand during the first nine months of 2018.
●  Accounts payable increased $2.5 million, or 65%, due to increased inventory purchases made during the third quarter of 2018.

●  Inventories decreased $1.5 million, or 16%, due to the sell through of inventory on hand to support sales in the third quarter of 2017.
●  Accounts payable decreased $1.9 million, or 40%, due primarily to increased inventory purchases towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 to support anticipated sales of our restaurant solutions terminals and subsequently paid in the first nine months of 2017.
Investing activities: Our capital expenditures, including capitalized software costs, were $1.2 million and $590 thousand in the first nine months of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Expenditures in the 2018 period were primarily for computer and networking equipment and furniture and fixtures purchases related to investments made in our U.K. facility to support the build-out of our internal sales infrastructure to sell directly to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers.
To a lesser extent, expenditures in the 2018 period included computer and networking equipment for our U.S. operations and leasehold improvements made at our Las Vegas facility.
Expenditures in the first nine months of 2017 were primarily for computer and networking equipment and, to a lesser extent, new product tooling equipment and purchases of furniture and fixtures.
Financing activities: We used $4.0 million of cash from financing activities during the first nine months of 2018 to purchase $2.0 million of common stock for treasury, pay dividends of $2.0 million to common shareholders and $265 thousand related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $229 thousand.
During the first nine months of 2017, we used $2.0 million of cash from financing activities to pay dividends of $1.9 million to common shareholders, purchase $358 thousand of common stock for treasury and $23 thousand related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $294 thousand.

Credit Facility and Borrowings 



We maintain a credit facility (the "TD Bank Credit Facility") with TD Bank N.A., which provides for a $20 million revolving credit line.
On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022.
Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all of our assets.
We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line.
The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12.5 million from $10 million.
The TD Bank Credit Facility imposes certain quarterly financial covenants on us and restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the creation of other liens.
We were in compliance with all financial covenants of the TD Bank Credit Facility at September 30, 2018.
The following table lists the financial covenants and the performance measurements at September 30, 2018: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of September 30, 2018, borrowings available under the TD Bank Credit facility were $20 million.
Shareholder Dividend Payments 



In 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program which is subject to the Board’s approval each quarter.
Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017.
Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $665 thousand, or $0.09 per share in the third quarter of 2018 and $661 thousand in the third quarter of 2017.
We expect to pay approximately $2.7 million in cash dividends to our common shareholders during the full year 2018.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, dividends declared and paid totaled $2.0 million, or $0.27 per share and $1.9 million, or $0.26 per share, respectively.
Stock Repurchase Program 



On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the "2018 Stock Repurchase Program").
The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue the repurchase program prior to such time.
We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account.
Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we repurchased 156,410 shares of our common stock for approximately $2.0 million at an average price per share of $12.78.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2107, we purchased 36,465 shares of our common stock for $358 thousand at an average price per share of $9.84.
Resource Sufficiency 



We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our expected cash flows generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our TD Bank Credit Facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and dividend payments and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months.
