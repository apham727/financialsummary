In the discussion that follows, results excluding this impact, primarily for subsidiaries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia/Pacific, are referred to as “constant currency.”  



 In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”), the Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial information, including:  



   ·    Sales adjusted for certain items that impact the year-over-year analysis, which includes the impact of certain acquisitions by adjusting Avnet’s prior periods to include the sales of acquired businesses, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
Operating income excluding such amounts is referred to as “adjusted operating income.” 



 The reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income is presented in the following table:  



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results.
Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes.
However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

As discussed in Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 did not have a material impact on the amounts of sales reported or the comparability of sales and gross profit margins year over year.

 Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $636.8 million, an increase of $24.2 million, or 3.9%, from the first quarter of fiscal 2018 gross profit of $612.6 million primarily driven by the increase in sales.

Accelerated depreciation relates to the incremental depreciation expense incurred related to the shortening of the estimated useful life of the Company’s enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system in the Americas compared to depreciation expense based on the original useful life of such ERP system.

Contractual Obligations  



 For a detailed description of the Company’s long-term debt and lease commitments for the next five years and thereafter, see Long-Term Contractual Obligations appearing in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
With the exception of the Company’s debt transactions discussed herein, there are no material changes to this information outside of normal borrowings and repayments of long-term debt and operating lease payments.
Financing Transactions  



 See Note 5, “Debt” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on financing transactions including the Credit Facility, the Securitization Program, and other outstanding debt as of September 29, 2018.
The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program as of September 29, 2018.
The Company has various lines of credit, financing arrangements and other forms of bank debt in the U.S. and various foreign locations to fund the short-term working capital, foreign exchange, overdraft and letter of credit needs of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Outstanding borrowings under such forms of debt at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.6 million.
Liquidity  



 The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $365.9 million as of September 29, 2018, of which $330.6 million was held outside the United States.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $621.1 million, of which $545.3 million was held outside of the United States.
As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company had a combined total borrowing capacity of $1.75 billion under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program.
There were no borrowings outstanding and $3.0 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility and $65.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Securitization Program, resulting in approximately $1.68 billion of total availability as of September 29, 2018.
Availability under the Securitization Program is subject to the Company having sufficient eligible trade accounts receivable to support desired borrowings.
The Company currently expects to utilize availability under credit facilities to support working capital and other general corporate purposes to the extent such incremental borrowings do not impact the Company’s investment grade credit rating.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $65.0 million under the Securitization Program.

During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities.
Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth.
The Company generated $296.5 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended September 29, 2018 from continuing operations.
To the extent the cash balances held in foreign locations cannot be remitted back to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner, those cash balances are generally used for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure needs and to support acquisitions, and are currently expected to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S.
The Company is still evaluating the impact of repatriating any additional foreign cash as a result of the Act.
In addition, local government regulations may restrict the Company’s ability to move funds among various locations under certain circumstances.
Management does not believe such restrictions would limit the Company’s ability to pursue its intended business strategy.
Additionally, as the Company integrates PF, the Company expects to use cash for restructuring, integration and other expenses.
In addition to continuing to make investments in acquisitions, as of September 29, 2018, the Company may repurchase up to an aggregate of $615.2 million of shares of the Company’s common stock through a $2.45 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors.
The Company may terminate or limit the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice.
Additionally, the Company currently expects to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of its common stock, subject to approval of the Board of Directors.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.20 per share, which resulted in $22.9 million of dividend payments during the quarter.
