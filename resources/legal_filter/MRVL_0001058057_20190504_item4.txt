Controls and Procedures



Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act).
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of May 4, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls



Our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud.
A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.
The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
