Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements—Unaudited



October 31, 2019



A.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required for complete consolidated financial statements.
In the opinion of our management, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position at October 31, 2019, results of operations for the three and six months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity for the three and six months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 and cash flows for the six months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018.
The Company’s results for the three and six months ended October 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year.
The terms “fiscal 2020” and “fiscal 2019” refer to our fiscal years ending April 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2019 contained in the Annual Report describes the significant accounting policies that we have used in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation



The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of American Software, Inc. (“American Software”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”).
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements



Adoption of New Accounting Standard



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
2016-02, Leases, which established new FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 842 ("ASC 842"), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
Under the new guidance, a lessee is required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.
Consistent under previous guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.
However, unlike previous guidance, which required only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new standard requires both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet.
These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The new lease standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company adopted ASC 842 on May 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective method and utilized the optional transition method under which the Company continues to apply the legacy guidance in ASC 840, Leases, including its disclosure requirements, in the comparative period presented.
Therefore, the adjustment to recognize the Company’s 



8

leases on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet related to the adoption of the new standard was recorded as of the adoption date and prior periods were not restated.
As part of the adoption of ASC 842, the Company elected to adopt certain of the optional practical expedients, including the package of practical expedients which, among other things, gives us the option to not reassess: 1) whether expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; 2) the lease classification for expired or existing leases; and 3) initial direct costs for existing leases.
The Company also elected the practical expedient to not record lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease obligations for leases with terms of 12 months or less.
Finally, the Company also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components, which allows it to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
The Company did not elect the hindsight practical expedient in its determination of the lease term for existing leases; therefore, the original lease terms, as determined under ASC 840, were used in the calculation of the Company’s initial ASC 842 lease liabilities.
Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of operating lease ROU assets of approximately $2.7 million, current operating lease liabilities of approximately $0.7 million and long-term operating lease liabilities of approximately $2.1 million as of May 1, 2019.
The adoption had no impact on retained deficit, the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, or the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
See Note C for further discussion of the Company’s leases.
B.
We derive our revenue from software licenses; maintenance services; consulting, implementation and training services; and Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”), which includes a subscription to our software as well as maintenance, hosting and managed services.
The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:



Step 1 – Identification of the Contract with the Customer



Step 2 – Identification of Promised Goods and Services and Evaluation of Whether the Promised Goods and Services are Distinct Performance Obligations



Step 3 – Determination of the Transaction Price



Step 4 – Allocation of the Transaction Price to Distinct Performance Obligations



Step 5 – Attribution of Revenue for Each Distinct Performance Obligation



Nature of Products and Services.
Subscription Fees.
Subscription fees include SaaS revenues for the right to use the software for a limited period of time in an environment hosted by the Company or by a third party.
The customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis over the Internet or via a dedicated line; however, the customer has no right to take delivery of the software without incurring a significant penalty.
The underlying arrangements typically include a single fee for the service that is billed monthly, quarterly or annually.
The Company’s SaaS solutions represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.
Revenue from a SaaS solution is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.
Professional Services and Other.
We believe the output method of hours worked provides the best depiction of the transfer of our services since the customer is receiving the benefit from our services as the work is performed.
The total amount of expense reimbursement included in professional services and other revenue was approximately $0.5 million 



9

and $0.9 million for the three and six months ended October 31, 2019, respectively and approximately $0.4 million and $0.7 million for the three and six months ended October 31, 2018, respectively.
Maintenance.
Revenue is derived from maintenance under which we provide customers with telephone consulting, product updates on a when and if available basis, and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services.
Maintenance for perpetual licenses is renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer.
Maintenance terms typically range from one to three years.
Revenue related to maintenance is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement since the Company is standing ready to provide a series of maintenance services that are substantially the same each period over the term; therefore, time is the best measure of progress.
Indirect Channel Revenue.
Sales Taxes.
Significant Judgments.
Judgment is required to determine whether each product and service is considered to be a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately under the contract.
We allocate the transaction price to distinct performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling price (“SSP”).
Therefore, we estimate SSP for software licenses using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price less the SSP of other products and services promised in the contract.
When performing relative selling price allocations, we use the contract price as the estimate of SSP if it falls within the Company’s range estimate of SSP, since any point within the range would be a valid price point on a standalone basis.
Contract Balances.
Fees for our software licenses are generally due within 30 days of contract execution.
SaaS solutions and maintenance are typically billed in advance on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis.
Services are typically billed as performed.
Additionally, we are applying the practical expedient to exclude any financing component from consideration for any contracts with payment terms of one year or less since we rarely offer terms extending beyond one year.
The consideration in our customer contracts is fixed.
That unconditional right to consideration is reflected in billed and unbilled accounts receivable in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with ASC Topic 606.
Deferred revenue consists of amounts collected prior to having completed the performance of maintenance, SaaS, hosting, and managed services.
We typically invoice customers for cloud subscription and support fees in advance on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis, with payment due at the start of the cloud subscription or support term.
During the three months ended October 31, 2019, we recognized $14 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of July 31, 2019.
During the six months ended October 31, 2019, we recognized $23 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of April 30, 2019.

Remaining Performance Obligations.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account under Topic 606.
The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised good or service to the customer.
The Company identifies and tracks the performance obligations at contract inception so that the Company can monitor and account for the performance obligations over the life of the contract.
Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of orders for which products have not been delivered or services have not been performed.
As of October 31, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $76 million.
The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately two-thirds of the remaining performance obligations over the next 12 months, with the remainder recognized thereafter.
Disaggregated Revenue.
The Company’s revenue by geography is as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Contract Costs.
The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those that the Company incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained (for example, a sales commission).
The Company capitalizes the costs incurred to fulfill a contract only if those costs meet all of the following criteria:



a.The costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that the Company can specifically identify.
b.The costs generate or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future.
c.The costs are expected to be recovered.
Certain sales commissions incurred by the Company were determined to be incremental costs to obtain the related contracts, which are deferred and amortized ratably over the economic benefit period.
These deferred commission costs are classified as current or non-current based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the expense.
Total deferred commissions at October 31, 2019 and April 30, 2019 were $2.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively.
Amortization of sales commissions was $0.4 million and $0.7 million for the three and six months ended October 31, 2019, respectively, which is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
No impairment losses were recognized during the periods.

 C. Leases



The Company’s operating leases are primarily related to facility leases for administration and sales.
The operating leases have terms ranging from three to five years.
While each of the leases includes renewal options, the Company has only included the base lease term in its calculation of lease assets and liabilities.
The Company does not have any finance leases.
The impact of the Company's leases on Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is presented in the operating activities section, which mainly consisted of cash paid for operating lease liabilities of approximately $0.5 million and the amortization of the right of use assets and operating lease obligations of $10,000 during the six months ended October 31, 2019.
The Company did not modify any existing leases or execute any new leases during the three and six months ended October 31, 2019.
Weighted average information associated with the measurement of the Company’s remaining operating lease obligations is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



D. Declaration of Dividend Payable



On August 21, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share of our Class A and Class B common stock.
The cash dividend was payable on December 6, 2019 to Class A and Class B shareholders of record at the close of business on November 22, 2019.
Class B common shares are convertible into Class A common shares at anytime, on a one-for-one basis.
Under the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, if dividends are declared, holders of Class A common shares shall receive a $0.05 dividend per share prior to the Class B common shares receiving any dividend and holders of Class A common shares shall receive a dividend at least equal to Class B common shares dividends on a per share basis.
As a result, the Company has computed the earnings per share in compliance with the Earnings Per Share Topic of the FASB ASC, which requires companies that have multiple classes of equity securities to use the “two-class” method in computing earnings per share.
For the Company’s basic earnings per share calculation, the Company uses the “two-class” method.
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to each class of common stock by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.
This allocation is based on management’s judgment after considering the dividend rights of the two-classes of common stock, the control of the Class B shareholders and the convertibility rights of the Class B shares to Class A shares.
If Class B shares convert to Class A shares during the period, the distributed net earnings for Class B shares is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated similarly to basic earnings per share, except that the calculation includes the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of options issuable under the Company’s stock incentive plans.
For the Company’s diluted earnings per share calculation for Class A shares, the Company uses the “if-converted” method.
This calculation assumes that all Class B common shares are converted into Class A common shares and, as a result, assumes there are no holders of Class B common shares to participate in undistributed earnings.
For the Company’s diluted earnings per share calculation for Class B shares, the Company uses the “two-class” method.
This calculation does not assume that all Class B common shares are converted into Class A common shares.
This allocation is based on management’s judgment after considering the dividend rights of the two-classes of common stock, the control of the Class B shareholders and the convertibility rights of the Class B shares into Class A shares.
The following tables set forth the computation of basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per common share (in thousands except for per share amounts):

*Amounts adjusted for rounding



For the three and six months ended October 31, 2019, we excluded options to purchase 12,174 and 330,620 Class A Common Shares, respectively, and for the three and six months ended October 31, 2018, we excluded options to purchase 12,000 and 6,065 Class A Common Shares, respectively, from the computation of diluted earnings per Class A Common Shares.
We excluded these option share amounts because the exercise prices of those options were greater than the average market price of the Class A Common Shares during the applicable period.
As of October 31, 2019, we had a total of 4,333,117 options outstanding and as of October 31, 2018, we had a total of 4,119,923 options outstanding.
F. Stock-Based Compensation



During the six months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, we granted options for 1,063,000 and 1,189,000 shares of Class A common stock, respectively.
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The forfeiture rates are estimated using historical data.
We recorded stock option compensation cost of approximately$0.5 million and $0.4 million and income tax benefits of approximately $411,742 and $12,000 from option exercises during the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We recorded stock option compensation cost of approximately $0.9 million and $0.8 million and income tax benefits of approximately $0.5 million and $0.3 million from option exercises during the six months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We record stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period directly to additional paid-in capital.
During the six months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, we issued 650,943 and 343,713 shares of Class A common stock, respectively, resulting from the exercise of stock options.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the six months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 based on market value at the exercise dates was approximately $3.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
As of October 31, 2019, unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option awards approximated $7.0 million, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of 2.03 years.
G. Fair Value of Financial Instruments



17

We measure our investments based on a fair value hierarchy disclosure framework that prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value.
This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:



•Level 1—Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
•Level 2—Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.
•Level 3—Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.
Cash Equivalents—Cash equivalents include investments in government obligation based money-market funds, other money market instruments and interest-bearing deposits with initial terms of three months or less.
The fair value of cash equivalents approximates its carrying value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
Marketable Securities—Marketable securities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded equity securities and equity index funds, and most U.S. government debt securities, as these securities all have quoted prices in active markets.
Marketable securities utilizing Level 2 inputs include municipal bonds.
We value these securities using market-corroborated pricing or other models that use observable inputs such as yield curves.
Under this repurchase plan, we have repurchased 1,053,679 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of approximately $6.2 million, which had no impact on fiscal 2020.

Industry Segments



FASB ASC 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments.
Operating segments are defined as components of a public entity about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision makers (“CODMs”), or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
Our CODMs are our Principal Executive Officer and our President.
We recently updated our operating segments to reflect the fact that we provide our software solutions through three major operating segments, which are further broken down into a total of six major product and service groups.
The three operating segments are (1) Supply Chain Management (“SCM”), (2) Information Technology (“IT”) Consulting and (3) Other.
Our primary operating units under our SCM segment include Logility, Inc., New Generation Computing, Inc. (“NGC”), Demand Management, Inc. (“DMI”), and Halo Business Intelligence (“Halo”).
Logility and NGC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of American Software; DMI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Logility; and Halo is a division of Logility.
In addition to our core SCM software business, we also offer technology staffing and consulting services through our wholly-owned subsidiary, The Proven Method, Inc., in the IT Consulting segment.
The Other segment consists of software and services provided to our legacy enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) customers, as well as corporate overhead and other common expenses.
All of our revenues are derived from external customers.
We do not have any intersegment revenue.
Consequently, it is not practical to show these items by operating segment.
19

In the following table, we have broken down the intersegment transactions applicable to the three and six months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



K. Major Customers



No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the three and six months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018.
Historically, we have not been required to make any payments under such indemnifications.
In addition, we warrant to our customers that our software products operate substantially in accordance with their specifications.
The cash dividend is payable on February 21, 2020 to Class A and Class B shareholders of record at the close of business on February 7, 2020.
