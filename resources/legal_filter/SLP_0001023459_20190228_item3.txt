Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  



As of February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.89 million and $9.40 million, respectively.
In addition, we do not hold any instruments for trading purposes and investment.
Some of our cash and cash equivalents are held in money market accounts; however, they are not exposed to market rate risk.
In the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, we sold $1,062,000 and $903,000, and $1,871,000 and $1,572,000, respectively, of software through representatives in certain Asian markets in local currencies.
These transactions give rise to receivables that are denominated in currencies other than the entityâ€™s functional currency.
The value of these receivables are subject to changes because the receivables may become worth more or less due to changes in currency exchange rates.
The majority of our software license agreements are denominated in U.S. dollars.
We base these changes on market conditions while working closely with our representatives.
We do not hedge currencies or enter into derivative contracts.
