The effective tax rate for the three months ended in 2018 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily as a result of the effect of permanent differences.
The effective tax rate for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 includes approximately $19,000 of tax benefit resulting from the vesting of restricted stock awards.
Net Income 



Net income for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 increased approximately $305,000 when compared to the same periods in 2017.
The increase of net income for the three month period is the result of the increase in revenue and lower SG&A as discussed above.
