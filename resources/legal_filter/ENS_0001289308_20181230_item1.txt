Basis of Presentation



The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included, unless otherwise disclosed.
The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K (SEC File No.
001-32253), which was filed on May 30, 2018 (the “2018 Annual Report”).
EnerSys (the “Company”) reports interim financial information for 13-week periods, except for the first quarter, which always begins on April 1, and the fourth quarter, which always ends on March 31.
The four quarters in fiscal 2019 end on July 1, 2018, September 30, 2018, December 30, 2018, and March 31, 2019, respectively.
The four quarters in fiscal 2018 ended on July 2, 2017, October 1, 2017, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018, respectively.
The consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially owned subsidiaries that the Company has the ability to control.
All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No.
2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” providing guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company adopted the ASU on April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method.
Under the modified retrospective transition method, the cumulative effect of applying Topic 606 to all contracts where all revenue has not been completely recognized under previously existing accounting principles that are not completed as of the date of adoption is recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (if applicable) while the comparative periods are not restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
There was no cumulative effect of adopting the standard at the date of initial application in retained earnings.
Concurrent with the adoption of the ASU, the Company has updated its revenue recognition policy as follows:



The Company determines revenue recognition by applying the following steps:



1. identify the contract with a customer;



2. identify the performance obligations in the contract;



3. determine the transaction price;



4. allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and



5. recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.
The Company recognizes revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the performance obligation to a customer.
Control of a performance obligation may transfer to the customer either at a point in time or over time depending on an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances for each contract, including the terms and conditions of the contract as agreed with the customer, as well as the nature of the products or services to be provided.
Each customer purchase order sets forth the transaction price for the products and services purchased under that arrangement.
8

Service revenues related to the work performed for the Company’s customers by its maintenance technicians generally represent a separate and distinct performance obligation.
Control for these services passes to the customer as the services are performed.
Service revenues for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 amounted to $37,472 and $106,672, respectively.
A small portion of the Company's customer arrangements oblige the Company to create customized products for its customers that require the bundling of both products and services into a single performance obligation because the individual products and services that are required to fulfill the customer requirements do not meet the definitions for a distinct performance obligation.
These customized products generally have no alternative use to the Company and the terms and conditions of these arrangements give the Company the enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable profit margin.
For these arrangements, control transfers over time and the Company measures progress towards completion by selecting the input or output method that best depicts the transfer of control of the underlying goods and services to the customer for each respective arrangement.
Methods used by the Company to measure progress toward completion include labor hours, costs incurred and units of production.
Revenues recognized over time for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 amounted to $19,421 and $54,316, respectively.
On December 30, 2018, the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations was approximately $97,189, of which, the Company estimates that approximately $34,244 will be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2019, $47,032 in fiscal 2020, $10,023 in fiscal 2021, $5,738 in fiscal 2022 and $152 in fiscal 2023.
The Company's typical payment terms are 30 days and sales arrangements do not contain any significant financing component for its customers.
As of December 30, 2018, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $24,736 and $7,430, respectively.
As of March 31, 2018, the current and non-current portion of contract liabilities were $9,387 and $7,094, respectively.
Amounts representing work completed and not billed to customers represent contract assets and were $31,916 and $24,810 as of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
Revenues recognized during the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019, that were included in the contract liability at the beginning of the current quarter and nine months, amounted to $1,950 and $2,695, respectively.
At December 30, 2018, the right of return asset related to the value of inventory anticipated to be returned from customers was $2,647 and refund liability representing amounts estimated to be refunded to customers was $5,013.
If shipping activities are performed after a customer obtains control of a product, the Company applies a policy election to account for shipping as an activity to fulfill the promise to transfer the product to the customer.
The Company generally provides customers with a product warranty that provides assurance that the products meet standard specifications and are free of defects.
The Company maintains a reserve for claims incurred under standard product warranty programs.
Performance obligations related to service warranties are not material to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company pays sales commissions to its sales representatives, which may be considered as incremental costs to obtain a contract.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted and requires the retrospective method to be applied to all periods presented.
The Company adopted this guidance effective April 1, 2018.

Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Adopted as of December 30, 2018



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e.
lessees and lessors).
This update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee.
This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.
The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.
This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted.
In order to evaluate the impact of ASU No.
This evaluation process includes a review of the Company's leasing contracts and an assessment of the completeness of the Company's lease population.
The Company is anticipating electing available practical expedients, including the transition option, upon adoption on April 1, 2019.
The Company is also currently implementing a software tool and concurrently identifying changes to its business processes, systems and controls to support adoption of the new standard.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
The guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those years.
Early adoption is permitted in any interim period or fiscal year before the effective date.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)”.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted, including the interim periods within those years.

Acquisition



On December 7, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Alpha Technologies Services, Inc. (“ATS”) and Alpha Technologies Ltd. (“ATL”), resulting in ATS and ATL becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (the “share purchase”).
Additionally, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Alpha Technologies Inc. and certain assets of Altair Advanced Industries, Inc. and other affiliates of ATS and ATL (all such sellers, together with ATS and ATL, “Alpha”), in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain restructuring agreements (collectively, the “asset acquisition” and together with the share purchase, the “acquisition”).
Based in Bellingham, Washington, Alpha is a global industry leader in the comprehensive commercial-grade energy solutions for broadband, telecom, renewable, industrial and traffic customers around the world.
The aggregate purchase consideration for the acquisition was $750,000, of which $650,000 was paid in cash and the balance was settled by issuing 1,177,630 shares of EnerSys common stock.
The fair value of the 1,177,630 shares had an approximate closing date fair value of $100,000.
The Company funded the cash portion of the acquisition with borrowings from the Amended Credit Facility as defined in Note 10.
See Note 10 for additional information.
The acquisition expands the Company's footprint in broadband and telecom markets.
The Company recorded the acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting and recognized the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition.
The results of operations of Alpha have been included in the Company’s Americas segment beginning December 8, 2018.
For the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 ended December 30, 2018, the contribution of the acquisition to net sales was $26,795.
Alpha recorded a net loss of $4,440 for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 ended December 30, 2018, excluding the effect of the transaction and integration costs, and interest expense on the debt to finance the acquisition.
The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulting goodwill.
The amounts recognized will be finalized as the

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of Alpha's identifiable intangible assets and the initial assessment of their respective estimated lives:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The preliminary purchase price of the acquisition has been allocated to the Company’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated acquisition date fair values.
The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets is recorded to goodwill.
The preliminary allocation of purchase price is based upon a valuation undertaken by the Company and is subject to change during the measurement period.
The initial accounting for the acquisition is incomplete pending final valuation of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The pro forma results for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018 exclude pre-tax transaction costs of $10,192 and $12,360, respectively, as well as the pre-tax amortization of the acquisition date step up to fair value of inventories of $3,747 (these were recognized in the actual results of the third quarter and nine months fiscal 2019) as they are considered non-recurring in nature.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The fair values of lead forward contracts are calculated using observable prices for lead as quoted on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) and, therefore, were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in its 2018 Annual Report.
The fair values for foreign currency forward contracts are based upon current quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2 based on the nature of the underlying market in which these derivatives are traded.
Financial Instruments



The fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to their short maturities.
The fair value of the Company’s short-term debt and borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility (as defined in Note 10), approximate their respective carrying value, as they are variable rate debt and the terms are comparable to market terms as of the balance sheet dates and are classified as Level 2.
The Company's 5.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”), with an original face value of $300,000, were issued in April 2015.
The fair value of the Notes represent the trading values based upon quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2.
The Notes were trading at approximately 97% and 102% of face value on December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company’s derivatives and Notes at December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018 were as follows:

Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships



Lead Forward Contracts



The Company enters into lead forward contracts to fix the price for a portion of its lead purchases.
Management considers the lead forward contracts to be effective against changes in the cash flows of the underlying lead purchases.
The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year.
At December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company has hedged the price to purchase approximately 77.0 million pounds and 62.9 million pounds of lead, respectively, for a total purchase price of $70,235 and $72,207, respectively.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of the Company’s foreign currency exposures for lead, as well as other foreign currency exposures so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the underlying foreign currency denominated exposures.
The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year.
As of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the notional amount of these contracts was $48,131 and $54,164, respectively.
In the coming twelve months, the Company anticipates that $4,929 of pretax loss relating to lead and foreign currency forward contracts will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) as part of cost of goods sold.
Derivatives not Designated in Hedging Relationships



Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany loans and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables.
These are not designated as hedging instruments and changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded directly in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income.
As of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the notional amount of these contracts was $59,819 and $28,486, respectively.
Presented below in tabular form is information on the location and amounts of derivative fair values in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets and derivative gains and losses in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income:

The tax provision for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 was based on the estimated effective tax rates applicable for the full years ending March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively, after giving effect to items specifically related to the interim periods.
As of the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company has elected the period cost method.
The Company does not expect to be subject to BEAT in fiscal 2019.
The consolidated effective income tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were (13.3)% and 141.2%, respectively, and for the nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 10.4% and 63.2%, respectively.
The rate decrease in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the comparable prior year periods of fiscal 2018 is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions and items related to the Tax Act.
Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be 74% for fiscal 2019 compared to 64% for fiscal 2018.
The foreign effective income tax rates for the nine months of fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 11.8% and 11.4%, respectively.
The rate increase compared to the prior year period is primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions.

These actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of environmental, anticompetition, employment, contract and other laws.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations, and threatened legal actions and proceedings.
European Competition Investigations 



Certain of the Company’s European subsidiaries had received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews from, and have had on-site inspections conducted by, the competition authorities of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands relating to conduct and anticompetitive practices of certain industrial battery participants.
The Company settled the Belgian regulatory proceeding in February 2016 by acknowledging certain anticompetitive practices and conduct and agreeing to pay a fine of $1,962, which was paid in March 2016.
During the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2019, the Company paid $2,402 towards certain aspects of this matter, which are under appeal.
As of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 and $2,326, respectively.
In June 2017, the Company settled a portion of its previously disclosed proceeding involving the German competition authority relating to conduct involving the Company's motive power battery business and agreed to pay a fine of $14,811, which was paid in July 2017.
As of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 relating to this matter.
Also in June 2017, the German competition authority issued a fining decision related to the Company's reserve power battery business, which constitutes the remaining portion of the previously disclosed German proceeding.
The Company is appealing this decision, including payment of the proposed fine of $11,415, and believes that the reserve power matter does not, based on current facts and circumstances known to management, require an accrual.
The Company is not required to escrow any portion of this fine during the appeal process.
In July 2017, the Company settled the Dutch regulatory proceeding and agreed to pay a fine of $11,229, which was paid in August 2017.
As of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 relating to the Dutch regulatory proceeding.
As of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, the Company had a total reserve balance of $0 and $2,326, respectively, in connection with these investigations and other related legal matters, included in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.
The foregoing estimate of losses is based upon currently available information for these proceedings.
EnerSys Sarl Litigation



In fiscal 2009, the Court of Commerce in Lyon, France ruled that the Company’s French subsidiary, EnerSys Sarl, which was acquired by the Company in 2002, was partially responsible for a 1999 fire in a French hotel under construction.
In a subsequent ruling by the Court of Appeal of Lyon, France, the Company's portion of damages was reduced, entitling the Company to a refund of the monies paid of €671, or $900, which was recorded and collected in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.
The Company further appealed the ruling to the French Supreme Court, which on March 14, 2012, ruled in the Company’s favor and ordered the case back to the Court of Appeal of Lyon to further review certain aspects of the original decision in the case, including the assessment of damages.
The Court of Appeal of Lyon heard arguments on April 9, 2013 and ruled in the Company’s favor on June 11, 2013, entitling the Company to a refund of the monies paid of €2,000, or $2,756.
One of the parties to the litigation that is adverse to the Company appealed this ruling to the French Supreme Court which appeal was denied in January 2015.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company and the adverse party settled this final item with the Company receiving a refund, including interest, from the adverse party of €2,500, or $2,843, for monies paid.
The Company believes that it has no further liability with respect to this matter.
Environmental Issues



As a result of its operations, the Company is subject to various federal, state, and local, as well as international environmental laws and regulations and is exposed to the costs and risks of registering, handling, processing, storing, transporting, and disposing of hazardous substances, especially lead and acid.
The Company’s operations are also subject to federal, state, local and international occupational safety and health regulations, including laws and regulations relating to exposure to lead in the workplace.
The Company is responsible for certain cleanup obligations at the former Yuasa battery facility in Sumter, South Carolina, that predates its ownership of this facility.
This manufacturing facility was closed in 2001 and the Company established a reserve for this facility, which was $1,082 and $1,109, as of December 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
Based on current information, the Company’s management believes this reserve is adequate to satisfy the Company’s environmental liabilities at this facility.
This facility is separate from the Company’s current metal fabrication facility in Sumter.
Lead and Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



To stabilize its lead costs and reduce volatility from currency movements, the Company enters into contracts with financial institutions.
The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year.
Please refer to Note 5 - Derivative Financial Instruments for more details.

On December 7, 2018, the Company amended the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the “Amended Credit Facility”) to fund the Alpha acquisition.
The Amended Credit Facility consists of $449,105 senior secured term loans (the “Amended 2017 Term Loan”), including a CAD 133,050 ($99,105) term loan and a $700,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Amended 2017 Revolver”).
The amendment resulted in an increase of the 2017 Term Loan and the 2017 Revolver by $299,105 and $100,000, respectively.
As of December 30, 2018, the Company had $344,000 outstanding under the Amended 2017 Revolver and $449,105 under the Amended 2017 Term Loan.
Subsequent to the amendment, the quarterly installments payable on the Amended 2017 Term Loan are $5,625 beginning December 31, 2018, $8,438 beginning December 31, 2019 and $11,250 beginning December 31, 2020 with a final payment of $315,000 on September 30, 2022.
The Amended Credit Facility may be increased by an aggregate amount of $325,000 in revolving commitments and / or one or more new tranches of term loans, under certain conditions.
Both the Amended 2017 Revolver and the Amended 2017 Term Loan bear interest, at the Company's option, at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (“CDOR”) plus between 1.25% and 2.00% (currently 1.25% and based on the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio) or (ii) the U.S. Dollar Base Rate (which equals, for any day a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America “Prime Rate” and (c) the Eurocurrency Base Rate plus 1%; provided that, if the Base Rate shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed zero) (iii) the CDOR Base Rate equal to the higher of (a) Bank of America “Prime Rate” and (b) average 30-day CDOR rate plus 0.50%.
The Amended Credit Facility allows for up to two temporary increases in the maximum leverage ratio from 3.50x to 4.00x for a four quarter period following an acquisition larger than $250,000.
Effective December 7, 2018 through December 30, 2018, the maximum leverage ratio has been increased to 4.00x.
The current portion of the Amended 2017 Term Loan of $22,500 is classified as long-term debt as the Company expects to refinance the future quarterly payments with revolver borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility.
