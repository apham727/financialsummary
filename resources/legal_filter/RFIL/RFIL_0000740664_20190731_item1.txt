(“Cables Unlimited”) and Rel-Tech Electronics, Inc. (“Rel-Tech”). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2019 include the accounts of RF Industries, Ltd., Cables Unlimited, Rel-Tech, and C Enterprises, Inc. (“C Enterprises”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that RF Industries, Ltd. formed for the sole purpose of acquiring the business and assets of C Enterprises, L.P. The acquisition of the business and assets of C Enterprises, L.P. was completed on March 15, 2019. For all periods on or before January 31, 2019, references herein to the “Company” shall refer to RF Industries, Ltd., Cables Unlimited, and Rel-Tech, and for all periods after January 31, 2019, references to the “Company” shall refer to RF Industries, Ltd., Cables Unlimited, Rel-Tech, and C Enterprises, collectively. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 
Revenue recognition 
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. This ASU requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets related to the rights and obligations created by those leases. The ASU also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to the nature, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, if “the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.” The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Note 2 - Business Acquisition

The acquisition was determined not to be material and was accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were recorded by the Company at their estimated fair values in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. There were no intangible assets identified as part of the acquisition.

On December 13, 2017, the Company granted 80,000 incentive stock options to an employee. These options vested 8,000 shares on the date of grant, and the balance vests as to 8,000 shares per year thereafter on each of the next nine anniversaries of December 13, 2017, and expire ten years from the date of grant. On December 3, 2018, the Company granted each of two employees 25,000 incentive stock options. These options vested 5,000 each on the date of grant, and the balance vests as to 5,000 shares each per year thereafter on each of the next four anniversaries of December 3, 2018, and expire ten years from the date of grant. On December 3, 2018, the Company also granted one employee 10,000 incentive stock options. These options vested 2,000 shares on the date of grant, and the balance vests as to 2,000 shares per year thereafter on each of the next four anniversaries of December 3, 2018, and expire ten years from the date of grant. On March 8, 2019, the Company granted one employee 25,000 incentive stock options. These options vested 5,000 on the date of grant, and the balance vests as to 5,000 shares per year thereafter on each of the next four anniversaries of March 8, 2019, and expire ten years from the date of grant. No other incentive stock options were granted to Company employees during the three and nine months ended July 31, 2019 and 2018. 
Company stock option plans 
As of July 31, 2019, $492,000 of expense with respect to nonvested share-based arrangements has yet to be recognized but is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 5.35 years. 
Non-employee directors receive a compensation package of $50,000 annually, which is paid one-half in cash and one-half through the grant of non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. During the quarter ended January 31, 2019, the Company granted each of its five non-employee directors 7,203 non-qualified stock options. The options have an exercise price of $8.07 per share. The number of stock options granted to each director was determined by dividing $25,000 by the fair value of a stock option grant using the Black-Scholes model ($3.471 per share). These options vest ratably over fiscal year 2019 and expire five years from the date of grant. Effective November 1, 2018, in addition to the compensation received for serving on the Board of Directors, the Chairman of each committee of the Board will receive $15,000 per year in cash for services rendered as Chairman. On June 7, 2019, a new director joined the Board. The Company granted the new director 3,082 non-qualified stock options with an exercise price of $7.50 per share. The number of stock options granted to this director was determined by dividing $10,000 of compensation (prorated for the period as an active director) by the fair value of a stock option grant using the Black-Scholes model ($3.245 per share). These options vest ratably over fiscal year 2019 and expire five years from the date of grant. No other non-qualified stock options were granted during the three and nine months ended July 31, 2019. 
Stock option expense 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with high-credit quality financial institutions. At July 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of federally insured limits in the amount of approximately $11.8 million. 
Two customers, a distributor (“Distributor A”) and an equipment manufacturer, accounted for approximately 23% and 19%, respectively, of the Company’s net sales for the nine-month period ended July 31, 2019. The equipment manufacturer’s accounts receivable balance accounted for 47% of the total net accounts receivable balance at July 31, 2019, while a different distributor (“Distributor B”) had an accounts receivable balance that accounted for 11% of the total net accounts receivable balance at July 31, 2019. For the three-month period ended July 31, 2019, Distributor B and the equipment manufacturer accounted for approximately 11% and 35%, respectively, of the Company’s net sales. 
For the nine-month period ended July 31, 2018, one customer who is a distributor, accounted for approximately 65% of the Company’s net sales. This same customer accounted for approximately 59% of the Company’s net sales for the three-month period ended July 31, 2018. At July 31, 2018, this customer’s accounts receivable balance accounted for approximately 61% of the total net accounts receivable balance. 
As of July 31, 2019, the RF Connector segment consisted of one division and the Custom Cabling segment was composed of three divisions. The four divisions that met the quantitative thresholds for segment reporting are the RF Connector and Cable Assembly division (“RF Connector division”), Cables Unlimited, Rel-Tech, and C Enterprises. While each segment had similar products and services, with one major exception, there was little overlapping of these services to their customer base. In addition, sales of product and services for the RF Connector segment were primarily through the distribution channel while the Custom Cabling segment sales were through a combination of distribution and direct to the end customer. 
As reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker, the Company evaluates the performance of each segment based on income or loss before income taxes. The Company charges depreciation and amortization directly to each division within the segment. Accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets are the only assets identified by segment. Except as discussed above, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same for the Company as a whole. 
Note 12 - Intangible assets 
Amortization expense for the nine months ended July 31, 2019 and the year ended October 31, 2018 was $206,000 and $275,000, respectively. As of July 31, 2019, the weighted-average amortization period for the amortizable intangible assets is 10.98 years. 
Note 13 - Commitments 
The Company currently leases its corporate headquarters and RF connector and cable assembly manufacturing facilities in San Diego, California. On June 5, 2017, the Company entered into a fifth amendment to its lease for its facility in San Diego, California. As a result, the Company now leases a total of approximately 21,908 square feet of office, warehouse and manufacturing space at its San Diego location. The term of the lease expires on July 31, 2022, and the rental payments under the lease currently are $26,176 per month.
