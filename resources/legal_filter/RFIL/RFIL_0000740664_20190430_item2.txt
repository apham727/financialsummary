Critical Accounting Policies 
On March 15, 2019, through C Enterprises, Inc. (“C Enterprises”), its newly formed subsidiary, the Company purchased the business and assets of C Enterprises L.P., a California based designer and manufacturer of quality connectivity solutions to telecommunications and data communications distributors. The acquisition was determined not to be material and was accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, and the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were recorded by the Company at their estimated fair values in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. 
Inventories 
The Company assesses property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which are considered definite-lived assets, for impairment. Definite-lived assets are reviewed when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. 
The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. 
We test our goodwill and trademarks and indefinite-lived assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances requires significant judgment and could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition and sale or disposition of all or a portion of a division. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.

Overview 
RF Industries, Ltd. (together with subsidiaries, the “Company”) is a national manufacturer and marketer of interconnect products and systems, including coaxial and specialty cables and connectors, fiber optic cables and connectors, and electrical and electronic specialty cables and components. Through its manufacturing and production facilities, the Company provides a wide selection of interconnect products and solutions primarily to telecommunications carriers and equipment manufacturers, wireless and network infrastructure carriers and manufacturers and to various original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in several market segments. 
For the six months ended April 30, 2019, most of the Company’s revenues were generated from the Custom Cabling segment from the sale of fiber optics cable, copper cabling, custom patch cord assemblies, and wiring harnesses (which accounted for 73% of the Company’s total sales for the six months ended April 30, 2019). Revenues from the RF Connector segment were generated from the sales of RF connector products and connector cable assemblies and accounted for 27% of the Company’s total sales for the six months ended April 30, 2019. 
 ·As of April 30, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents equal to $13.9 million. 
 ·As of April 30, 2019, the Company had $30.5 million in current assets and $4.7 million in current liabilities. 
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, the Company’s backlog increased significantly to $11 million as of October 31, 2018. Since the end of fiscal year 2018, the Company has filled most of the October 31, 2018 backlog. However, the Company has continued to receive additional bookings while maintaining its level of shipments. As a result, the Company had $10 million of backlog as of the current quarter ended April 30, 2019. Since purchase orders are submitted from customers based on the timing of their requirements, the Company’s ability to predict orders in future periods or trends in future periods is limited. Furthermore, purchase orders may be subject to cancellation from customers, although the Company has not historically experienced material cancellations of purchase orders. As a result of the Company’s backlog balance as of April 30, 2019, the Company’s liquidity and available capital resources are expected to continue to improve during the balance of the current fiscal year. 
The Company used cash of $2.6 million during the six months ended April 30, 2019 due largely to an increase in sales, which resulted in increased inventory purchases and an increase in outstanding accounts receivables as of quarter-end. Net income of $1.7 million, with an added increase in cash from noncash credits of $0.3 million from depreciation and amortization and $0.2 million from stock-based compensation expense, was offset by an increase in accounts receivable ($2.4 million) and inventories ($0.3 million) as well as a decrease in accrued expenses primarily due to the payout of prior year bonuses ($0.8 million) and an increase in accounts payable ($0.7 million). 
The Company used $0.8 million during the six months ended April 30, 2019 for capital expenditures and the purchase of the assets and business of C Enterprises. In addition, during the six months ended April 30, 2019, the Company paid $0.4 million of cash as dividends. These net cash outlays were partially offset by $0.4 million that the Company received from the exercise of stock options. 
The Company does not anticipate needing material additional capital equipment in the next twelve months. In the past, the Company has financed some of its equipment and furnishings requirements through capital leases. No additional capital equipment purchases have been currently identified that would require significant additional leasing or capital expenditures during the next twelve months. Management also believes that based on the Company’s current financial condition, its current backlog of unfulfilled orders and its anticipated future operations, the Company would be able to finance its expansion, if necessary. 
From time to time, the Company may undertake acquisitions of other companies or product lines in order to diversify its product and solutions offerings and customer base. Conversely, the Company may undertake the disposition of a division or product line due to changes in the Company’s business strategy or market conditions. Acquisitions may require the outlay of cash, which may reduce the Company’s liquidity and capital resources while dispositions may increase the Company’s cash position, liquidity and capital resources. For example, on March 15, 2019, the Company purchased all of the assets of C Enterprises for $600,000 in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. C Enterprises is a California based designer, manufacturer, and distributor of fiber and copper custom cables and cable assembles, and other related products used in the data center, networking, and wireless markets. If the Company acquires other businesses in the future for a purchase price payable in whole or in part in cash, its future liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected. The Company has previously announced its intention to make additional acquisitions in order to expand its product offerings and customer base. 
We are currently evaluating the financial impact of the import tariffs that were recently enacted in the U.S. and abroad. While we do not believe that the financial impact on the Company of the enacted tariffs will be material, we recognize that there is uncertainty related to potential costs related to these actions. 
Results of Operations 
On October 31, 2018, the Company sold all of the shares of Comnet Telecom Supply, Inc. (“Comnet”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that was part of the Company’s Custom Cabling segment. Accordingly, the Company’s results of operations for the both three and six month periods ended April 30, 2018 have been adjusted to remove the results of Comnet; the operating results of Comnet in 2018 are reported in the attached condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations on the statement of operations. During the three months ended April 30, 2018, Comnet had net sales of $1.9 million and income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes of $0.1 million. During the six months ended April 30, 2018, Comnet had net sales of $4.2 million and income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes of $0.3 million. Comnet was sold as part of the Company’s business transformation toward a one company culture and operating structure to more efficiently leverage its capabilities across the entire business; Comnet’s business did not match the Company’s go-to-market strategy since it operated with a different sales model and margin profile than the rest of the Company. 
On March 15, 2019, the Company acquired the assets and business of C Enterprises, L.P. The C Enterprises business is now conducted by the Company through its new C Enterprises, Inc. subsidiary. The Company paid $600,000 of cash, and assumed certain liabilities for the purchase of the C Enterprises business. The financial results of C Enterprises during the period from March 15, 2019 to April 30, 2019 are included in the results of operations for 2019. 
Three Months Ended April 30, 2019 vs. Three Months Ended April 30, 2018 
Net sales of $13.6 million decreased by 34%, or $6.9 million, for the three months ended April 30, 2019 (the “fiscal 2019 quarter”) when compared to the three months ended April 30, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 quarter”). Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment decreased by $7.5 million, or 42%, when compared to the fiscal 2018 quarter. The year-over-year decline in sales was primarily due to the largest series of orders the Company has ever received in the 2018 fiscal quarter, which orders significantly enhanced net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The net sales at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment in the fiscal 2019 second quarter were supplemented by $1.7 million of net sales that the Company generated from its newly acquired C Enterprises subsidiary. The Company did not own C Enterprises in the 2018 fiscal year. However, net sales at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment for the second quarter ended April 30, 2019 increased over the first quarter ended January 31, 2019. Even excluding the additional net sales generated by C Enterprises in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, net sales in the Company’s Custom Cabling segment increased by $0.7 million over the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Net sales for the fiscal 2019 quarter at the RF Connector segment increased by $0.6 million, or 22%, to $3.3 million as compared to $2.7 million for the fiscal 2018 quarter. 
Engineering expenses decreased $0.3 million during the fiscal 2019 quarter to $0.3 million compared to $0.6 million for the fiscal 2018 quarter due to higher compensation expense related to engineering activities in the fiscal 2018 quarter to support the higher net sales in the fiscal 2018 quarter. Engineering expenses represent costs incurred relating to the ongoing development of new products. 
For the fiscal 2019 quarter, income (loss) from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $1.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, as compared to $4.4 million and ($0.5) million for the comparable second quarter last year. The decrease in income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling segment was primarily due to the higher sales in the fiscal 2018 quarter, while the RF Connector segment had an increase in income (loss) from continuing operations due in part to the increase in sales and an increase in gross margins. 
The provision for income taxes was 23% and 20% of income before income taxes for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate from period to period was primarily driven by the elimination of the benefit from the domestic production activities deduction and the one-time benefit recorded in the prior year related to the reduction in the Company’s deferred tax liability due to the change in the federal tax rate, both as a result of the Tax Act. 
All of the income from discontinued operations, net of tax, during the fiscal 2018 quarter represents the results from the operations of Comnet Telecom Supply, Inc., a former subsidiary of the Company that was discontinued on October 31, 2018. 
For the fiscal 2019 quarter, net income was $1.1 million and fully diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.11 per share as compared to an income from continuing operations of $3.2 million and fully diluted EPS of $0.34 per share for the fiscal 2018 quarter. For the fiscal 2019 quarter, the diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 9,837,964 as compared to 9,386,194 for the fiscal 2018 quarter. 
Six Months Ended April 30, 2019 vs. Six Months Ended April 30, 2018 
Net sales of $24.3 million decreased by 15%, or $4.2 million, for the six months ended April 30, 2019 (the “fiscal 2019 six month period”) when compared to the six months ended April 30, 2018 (the “fiscal 2018 six month period”). The decrease in net sales is attributable to a decrease in net sales at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment. Net sales for the fiscal 2019 six month period at the Company’s Custom Cabling segment decreased $5.4 million, or 24%, to $17.7 million when compared to the fiscal 2018 six month period net sales of $23.1 million. The year-over-year decline in sales was a result of the largest series of orders that the Company has ever received, which orders it received in the year ago six month period ended April 30, 2018. Net sales for the fiscal 2019 six month period at the RF Connector segment increased by $1.2 million, or 23%, to $6.6 million as compared to $5.4 million for the fiscal 2018 six month period. 
The Company’s gross profit as a percentage of sales in the fiscal 2019 six month period decreased by 6% to 30% compared to 36% in the fiscal 2018 six month period due primarily to the substantially higher revenues at the Custom Cabling division in the fiscal 2018 six month period. 
Selling and general expenses decreased by $0.4 million during the fiscal 2019 six month period to $4.4 million from $4.8 million in the fiscal 2018 six month period. The decrease in selling and general expenses was primarily due to the higher compensation resulting from the higher net sales in the fiscal 2018 six month period. Selling and general expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 18% for the fiscal 2019 six month period as compared to 17% for the fiscal 2018 six month period partially due to one-time costs of $100,000 related to the acquisition of C Enterprises in the fiscal 2019 quarter, and partially due to the absorption of the selling and general expenses of the newly acquired C Enterprises. 
For the fiscal 2019 six month period, income (loss) from continuing operations for the Custom Cabling segment and the RF Connector segment was $1.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, as compared to $5.0 million and $(0.6) million for the comparable six months last year. The decrease in income from continuing operations at the Custom Cabling segment was primarily due to the higher sales in the fiscal 2018 six month period, while the increase at RF Connector was primarily due in part to the increase in sales and an increase in gross margins. 
The provision for income taxes was 22% and 20% of income before income taxes for the six months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate from period to period was primarily driven by the elimination of the benefit from the domestic production activities deduction and the one-time benefit recorded in the prior year related to the reduction in the Company’s deferred tax liability due to the change in the federal tax rate, both as a result of the Tax Act. 
For the fiscal 2019 six month period, net income was $1.7 million and fully diluted EPS was $0.17 per share as compared to an income from continuing operations of $3.5 million and fully diluted EPS of $0.38 per share for the fiscal 2018 six month period.
