(4) Revenue Recognition  



On February 1, 2018 we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 606), which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
The core principle of ASC Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.
ASC Topic 606 defines a five step process to recognize revenue and requires more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process than required under previous U.S. GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, determining and estimating the amount of any variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.
We adopted this standard using the modified retrospective method and have applied the guidance to all contracts within the scope of ASC Topic 606 as of the February 1, 2018 adoption date.
Accordingly, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our revenue recognition and there was no cumulative effective adjustment as of February 1, 2018 as a result of the adoption of ASC Topic 606.
Significant judgments primarily include the identification of performance obligation arrangements as well as the pattern of delivery for those services.
We derive revenue from the sale of (i) hardware including, digital color label printers and specialty OEM printing systems, portable data acquisition systems and airborne printers used in the flight deck and in the cabin of military, commercial and business aircraft, (ii) related supplies required in the operation of the hardware, (iii) repairs and maintenance of equipment and (iv) service agreements.
The transfer of control generally occurs at one point in time, upon shipment, when title and risk of loss pass to the customer.
Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as a reduction to revenue.
Many of the contracts entered into with customers are commonly comprised of a combination of equipment, supplies, installation and/or training services.
In order to be distinct, the product must perform either on its own or with readily available resources and must be separate within the context of the contract.
The majority of our hardware products contain embedded operating systems and data management software which is included in the purchase price of the equipment.
Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and are accounted for as a single performance obligation for which revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to the customer.
The delivery of installation and training services are not assessed to determine whether they are separate performance obligations, as the amounts are not material to the contract.
Shipping and handling activities that occur after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations, as allowed under a practical expedient provided by ASC Topic 606.
These services are short in duration, typically less than one month, and total less than 9.0% of revenue for the six months ended July 28, 2018.
Revenue is recognized as services are rendered and accepted by the customer.
We also provide service agreements on certain of our Product Identification equipment.
Service agreements are purchased separately from the equipment and provide for the right to obtain service and maintenance on the equipment for a period of typically one to two years.
Accordingly, revenue on these agreements is recognized over the term of the agreements.
The portion of service agreement contracts that are uncompleted at the end of any reporting period are included in deferred revenue.

Table of Contents 



We generally provide warranties for our products.
The standard warranty period is typically 12 months for most hardware products except for airborne printers, which typically have warranties that extend for 4-5 years, consistent with industry practice.
On occasion, customers request a warranty period longer than our standard warranty.
In those instances, in which extended warranty services are separately quoted to the customer, an additional performance obligation is created, and the associated revenue is deferred and recognized as service revenue ratably over the term of the extended warranty period.
The portion of service contracts and extended warranty services agreements that are uncompleted at the end of any reporting period are included in deferred revenue.
Revenues disaggregated by primary geographic markets and major product type are as follows:  



Primary geographical markets:

Accounts Receivable  



Credit is extended based upon an evaluation of the customers financial condition.
Accounts receivable are stated at their estimated net realizable value.
Standard payment terms are typically 30 days after shipment, but vary by type and geographic location of our customers.
Contract Assets and Liabilities  



We normally do not have contract assets, which are primarily unbilled accounts receivable that are conditional on something other than the passage of time.
The slight decrease in the deferred revenue at July 28, 2018 is primarily due to approximately $403,000 of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2018, offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations.
These costs are deferred and amortized based on the forecasted number of units sold over the estimated benefit term, which is currently estimated to be approximately 10 years.
There has been no change in the Companys accounting for these contracts as a result of the adoption of ASC Topic 606.
The balance of these contract assets at January 31, 2018 was $832,000 and was reported in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company incurred an additional $150,000 in incremental direct costs which were deferred.
The amortization of incremental direct costs was $9,000 and $18,000 for the three and six months periods ended July 28, 2018.
The balance of the deferred incremental direct contract costs net of accumulated amortization at July 28, 2018 is $967,000 and is reported in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
This amount is expected to be amortized over its estimated remaining period of benefit, which we currently estimate to be approximately 8 years.
These costs include sales commissions paid to the internal direct sales team as well as to third-party representatives and distributors.
Contractual agreements with each of these parties outline commission structures and rates to be paid.
Generally speaking, the contracts are all individual procurement decisions by the customers and do not include renewal provisions and as such the majority of the contracts have an economic life of significantly less than a year.
The purchase price consisted of an initial upfront payment of $14.6 million in cash.
The Honeywell Agreement also provided for guaranteed minimum royalty payments of $15.0 million, to be paid to Honeywell over the next ten years, based on gross revenues from the sales of the printers, paper and repair services of the licensed products.
The royalty rates vary based on the year in which they are paid or earned and product sold or service provided, and range from single-digit to mid double-digit percentages of gross revenue.

This transaction was evaluated under Accounting Standard Update 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, and was accounted for as an asset acquisition.
The initial upfront payment of $14.6 million was paid at the closing of this transaction using borrowings from the Companys revolving credit facility under its amended Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A.
The minimum royalty payment obligation of $15.0 million was recorded at the present value of the annual minimum royalty payments using a present value factor of 2.8%, which is based on the estimated after tax cost of debt for similar companies.
At July 28, 2018, the current portion of the minimum royalty obligation to be paid over the next twelve months is $1.6 million and is reported as a current liability; and the remainder of $10.9 million is reported as a long-term liability on the Companys condensed consolidated balance sheet.
For the three and six months ended July 28, 2018, the Company incurred $0.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, in excess royalty expense, which is included in cost of revenue in the Companys condensed consolidated statement of income for the period ended July 28, 2018.
A total of $1.4 million of excess royalty is payable at July 28, 2018 and reported as a current liability on the Companys condensed consolidated balance sheet.
In connection with the Honeywell Agreement, the Company also entered into a Transition Services Agreement (TSA) with Honeywell related to the transfer of the manufacturing and repair of the licensed printers from their current locations to AstroNovas plant in West Warwick, Rhode Island.
During the current year, the Company paid $0.4 million to acquire an additional repair facility revenue stream in accordance with the terms of the TSA.
The additional $0.4 million TSA obligation payment was included as part of the Honeywell Agreement purchase price and recorded as an increase to the related intangible asset.
Under the terms of the TSA, the Company is required to pay for certain expenses incurred by Honeywell during the period in which product manufacturing is transferred to the Companys facilities.
In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, a change in accounting estimates for revenue subject to customer rebates under the Honeywell Agreement increased operating income by $0.4 million ($0.3 million net of tax or $0.05 per diluted share).
Transaction costs incurred for this acquisition were $0.3 million and were included as part of the purchase price.
The assets acquired in connection with the acquisition were recorded by the Company at their estimated relative fair values as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The purchase price, including the initial payment, the minimum royalty payment obligation, transaction costs, and the subsequent TSA $0.4 million obligation payment, were allocated based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired.
The fair value of the intangible assets acquired was estimated by applying the income approach.
These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and therefore represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure. Key assumptions in estimating the fair value of the intangibles include (1) the remaining life of the intangibles based on the term of the Honeywell Asset Purchase and License Agreement of 10 years, (2) a range of annual earnings projections from $3.9 million  $5.4 million and (3) the Companys internal rate of return of 21.0%.
The acquired identifiable intangible assets are as follows:

Trojan Label  



On February 1, 2017, our wholly-owned Danish subsidiary, ANI ApS, completed the acquisition of the issued and outstanding equity interests of TrojanLabel ApS (TrojanLabel).
The purchase price of this acquisition was 62.9 million Danish Krone (approximately $9.1 million), net of cash acquired of 976,000 Danish Krone (approximately $0.1 million), of which 6.4 million Danish Krone (approximately $0.9 million) was placed in escrow to secure certain post-closing working capital adjustments and indemnification obligations of the sellers.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company settled the post-closing adjustments with TrojanLabel and recovered approximately 891,000 Danish Krone (approximately $145,000) of the amount held in escrow account, which was recognized as an adjustment to the allowance account for TrojanLabel receivables.
The remaining escrow balance was retained by TrojanLabel.
(6) Net Income Per Common Share  



Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares and, if dilutive, common equivalent shares, determined using the treasury stock method for stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units outstanding during the period.
A reconciliation of the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per share is as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



For the three and six months ended July 28, 2018, the diluted per share amounts do not reflect common equivalent shares outstanding of 273,275 and 340,575, respectively.
For the three and six months ended July 29, 2017, the diluted per share amounts do not reflect common equivalent shares outstanding of 591,359 and 591,309, respectively.
These outstanding common equivalent shares were not included due to their anti-dilutive effect.
Restricted stock units which vest based upon achievement of performance targets are excluded from the diluted shares outstanding unless the performance targets have been met as of the end of the reporting period, regardless of whether such performance targets are probable of achievement as of the end of the measurement period.

Includes additional $0.4 million related to the payment in fiscal 2019 in accordance with the terms of the TSA.
There were no impairments to intangible assets during the periods ended July 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017.
With respect to the acquired intangibles included in the table above, amortization expense of $1,022,000 and $304,000 related to the above acquired intangibles has been included in the condensed consolidated statement of income for the three months ended July 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017, respectively.
Amortization expense of $2,046,000 and $603,000 related to the above acquired intangibles has been included in the condensed consolidated statement of income for the six months ended July 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017, respectively.
Estimated amortization expense for the next five fiscal years is as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



(8) Share-Based Compensation  



At the Companys annual meeting of shareholders held on June 4, 2018, the Companys shareholders approved the AstroNova, Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2018 Plan).
Following the approval of the 2018 Plan at the Companys annual meeting of shareholders, the Company ceased granting new equity awards pursuant to the 2015 Plan.
The Company has a Non-Employee Director Annual Compensation Program (the Program) under which each non-employee director receives an automatic grant of restricted stock awards (RSAs) on the first business day of each fiscal quarter.
Under the Program, the number of whole shares to be granted each quarter is equal to 25% of the number calculated by dividing the director compensation amount by the fair market value of the Companys stock on such day.
The director annual compensation amount was $65,000 in fiscal year 2018 and is $75,000 in fiscal year 2019.
In addition, the Chairman of the Board receives RSAs with an aggregate value of $6,000, and the Chairs of the Audit and Compensation Committees each receive RSAs with an aggregate value of $4,000, also issued in quarterly installments and calculated in the same manner as the directors RSA grants.
RSAs granted prior to March 30, 2017 became fully vested on the first anniversary of the date of grant.
RSAs granted subsequent to March 30, 2017 become vested three months after the date of grant.
A total of 5,370 and 7,314 shares were awarded to the non-employee directors as compensation under the Program in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.

In April 2013 (fiscal year 2014), the Company granted options and RSUs to officers (2014 RSUs).
The 2014 RSUs vested as follows: twenty-five percent vested on the third anniversary of the grant date, fifty percent vested upon the Company achieving its cumulative budgeted net revenue target for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 (the Measurement Period), and twenty-five percent vested upon the Company achieving a target average annual ORONA (operating income return on net assets as calculated under the Domestic Management Bonus Plan) for the Measurement Period.
The grantee may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of more than fifty percent of the common stock issued upon vesting of the 2014 RSUs until the first anniversary of the vesting date.
In April 2016, 9,300 of the 2014 RSUs vested, as the Company achieved the targeted average annual ORONA, as defined in the plan, for the Measurement Period and another 9,300 vested as a result of the third year anniversary date of the grant.
Additionally, on February 1, 2014, the Company accelerated the vesting of 4,166 of the 2014 RSUs held by Everett Pizzuti in connection with his retirement.

In May 2015 (fiscal year 2016), the Company granted an aggregate of 80,000 time-based and 155,000 performance-based RSUs (2016 RSUs) to certain officers of the Company.
The time-based 2016 RSUs vest in four equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date.
The performance-based 2016 RSUs vest over three years based upon the increase in revenue, if any, achieved each fiscal year relative to a three-year revenue increase goal.
Performance-based 2016 RSUs that are earned based on organic revenue growth are fully vested when earned, while those earned based on revenue growth via acquisitions vest annually over a three-year period following the fiscal year in which the revenue growth occurs.
Any performance-based 2016 RSUs that were not earned at the end of fiscal 2018 were forfeited.
The expense for such shares was recognized in the fiscal year in which the results were achieved, however, the shares were not fully earned until approved by the Compensation Committee in the first quarter of the following fiscal year.
Based upon revenue in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, 33,638, 9,025 and 15,810 shares of the performance based RSUs were earned in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

No adjustments have been raised at this time.
We were capable of reasonably estimating the one-time deemed repatriation tax and recorded a provisional expense of $0.1 million at January 31, 2018.
ASU 2018-05 allows a company to record a provisional amount when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the changes in the Tax Reform Act.
The measurement period ends when the company has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year from the date of enactment of the Tax Reform Act.
During the six months ended July 28, 2018, there were no changes made to the provisional amounts recognized in fiscal 2018.
We will complete our analysis over a one-year measurement period ending December 22, 2018, and any adjustments during this measurement period will be included in net earnings from continuing operations as an adjustment to income tax expense in the reporting period when such adjustments are determined.
(11) Credit Agreement  



On February 28, 2017, the Company and its wholly owned Danish subsidiaries, ANI ApS and TrojanLabel ApS (together, the Parties), entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A.
(the Lender).
The Credit Agreement provided for a term loan to ANI ApS in the principal amount of $9.2 million.
The Credit Agreement also provided for a $10.0 million revolving credit facility available to the Company for general corporate purposes.
In connection with the Honeywell Purchase and License Agreement, on September 28, 2017, the Parties entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender.
The initial upfront payment of $14.6 million for the Honeywell Agreement was paid using borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility.
On November 30, 2017, the Parties entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender.
The Second Amendment provided for a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million, in addition to the revolving credit facility for the Company and the term loan previously borrowed by ANI ApS at the original closing under the Credit Agreement.
The proceeds from the term loan were used to repay the entire $14.6 million principal balance of the revolving loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
The principal amount of the revolving credit facility which had been temporarily increased to $15.0 million was reduced to $10.0 million effective upon the closing of the Second Amendment and the maturity date for the revolving credit facility was extended to November 30, 2022.
On April 17, 2018, the Parties entered into a Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender.
The Third Amendment provides that no Immaterial Subsidiary will be required to become a guarantor or securing party under (unless requested by the Lender during default) or have its equity pledged pursuant to the Credit Agreement.
The Third Amendment defines Immaterial Subsidiary as any subsidiary of the Company with (a) consolidated total assets that do not exceed 5.0% of the consolidated total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and (b) revenues that do not exceed 5.0% of the consolidated revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries, as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter; provided that Immaterial Subsidiaries shall not account for, in the aggregate, more than 10% the of consolidated total assets or consolidated revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries.
In connection with the Credit Agreement, AstroNova and ANI ApS entered into certain hedging arrangements with the Lender to manage the variable interest rate risk and currency risk associated with its payments in respect of the term loans.
Refer to Note 13, Derivative Financial Instruments and Risk Management for further information about these arrangements.
Revolving credit loans may be borrowed, at the Companys option, in U.S.
Dollars or, subject to certain conditions, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars or Danish Krone.
Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, either (a) the LIBOR rate (or in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in a currency other than U.S.
Dollars, the applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of Americas publicly announced prime rate or (iii) the LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.0% to 0.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.
The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility at the rate of 0.25% per annum.
The Parties must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.
The financial covenants consist of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio.
The Credit Agreement contains limitations, in each case subject to various exceptions and thresholds, on the Companys and its subsidiaries ability to incur future indebtedness, to place liens on assets, to conduct mergers or acquisitions, to sell assets, to alter their capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of their business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness.
The Credit Agreement permits the Company to pay cash dividends on and repurchase shares of its common stock, subject to certain limitations.
The Company believes it is in compliance with all of the covenants in the Credit Agreement as of July 28, 2018.

(13) Derivative Financial Instruments and Risk Management  



The Company has entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap to manage the interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the floating-rate foreign currency-denominated term loan borrowing by our Danish Subsidiary and an interest rate swap to manage the interest rate risk associated with the variable rate $15.0 million term loan borrowing by the Company.
In accordance with the guidance in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, both swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of floating-rate borrowings.

Revenue Recognition  



In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.
ASU 2014-09 applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services.
Under this guidance, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company adopted this guidance effective February 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.
Refer to Note 4, Revenue Recognition for further details.
Derivatives and Hedging  



In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The objective of this new guidance is to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships by, among other things, eliminating the requirement to separately measure and record hedge ineffectiveness.
ASU 2017-12 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted.
We adopted the provisions of this guidance effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

Leases  



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 supersedes current guidance related to accounting for leases and is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities in the balance sheet for operating leases with lease terms greater than twelve months.
The update also requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements, which amends ASU 2016-02 to provide an additional (and optional) transition method to adopt the new lease standard.
These ASUs will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years (Q1 fiscal 2020 for AstroNova), with early adoption permitted.

(17) Fair Value  



Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  



Fair value is applied to our financial assets and liabilities including money market funds, available for sale securities, derivative instruments and a contingent consideration liability relating to an earnout payment on future TrojanLabel operating results.
The following tables provide a summary of the financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as of July 28, 2018 and January 31, 2018:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



For our money market funds and municipal obligations, we utilize the market approach to measure fair value.
The market approach is based on using quoted prices for identical or similar assets.
We also use the market approach to measure fair value of our derivative instruments.
Derivative instruments were measured at fair value using readily observable market inputs, such as quotations on interest rates and foreign exchange rates, and is classified as Level 2 because they are an over-the-counter contract with a bank counterparty that is not traded in an active market.
The fair value of the earnout liability incurred in connection with the Companys acquisition of TrojanLabel was determined using the option approach methodology which includes using significant inputs that are not observable in the market and therefore classified as Level 3.
Key assumptions in estimating the fair value of the contingent consideration liability included (1) the estimated earnout targets over the next seven years of $0.5 million-$1.4 million, (2) the probability of success (achievement of the various contingent events) from 0.0%-0.9% and (3) a risk-adjusted discount rate of approximately 2.68%-4.9% used to adjust the probability-weighted earnout payments to their present value.
There was no change in the fair value of the earnout liability for the six months ended July 28, 2018.

Assets and Liabilities Not Recorded at Fair Value  



As of July 28, 2018 and January 31, 2018, the Companys long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt not reflected in the financial statements at fair value, is reflected in the table below:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The fair value of the Companys long-term debt, including the current portion, is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar borrowings with the same maturities would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and is classified as Level 3.
