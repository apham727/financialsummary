Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



Basis of Presentation



The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X.
The January 28, 2018 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments except as otherwise noted, considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position have been included.
The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period.
The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018.
Significant Accounting Policies



Except for the accounting policy for revenue recognition, which was updated as a result of adopting a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018.
We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.
For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.
Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products.
As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed.
We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.

Software Licensing



Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer.
Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software.
Software licenses are frequently sold along with post contract customer support, or PCS.
For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation.
Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer.
PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.
Fiscal Year



We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January.
Fiscal years 2019 and 2018 are both 52-week years.
The second quarters of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 were both 13-week quarters.
Reclassifications



Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.
Principles of Consolidation



Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies, in all industries.
We adopted this guidance on January 29, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach.
Refer to Note 2 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and applied it prospectively.
Recent Accounting Pronouncement Not Yet Adopted



In February 2016 and July 2018, the FASB issued accounting standards updates regarding the accounting for leases by which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for lease terms of more than 12 months.
The FASB also recently provided a practical expedient transition method to adopt the new lease accounting requirements.
We are evaluating the impact of adopting the new lease accounting standards on our consolidated financial statements, systems and processes in conjunction with our review of lease agreements.
The updates will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
We expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 2 - New Revenue Accounting Standard



Method and Impact of Adoption



On January 29, 2018, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard using the modified retrospective method and applied it to contracts that were not completed as of that date.
Upon adoption, we recognized the cumulative effect of the new standard as a $7 million increase to opening retained earnings, net of tax.
Comparative information for prior periods has not been adjusted.
Deferred Revenue and Performance Obligations



Deferred revenue is comprised mainly of customer advances and deferrals related to license and development arrangements and PCS related to software licensing.
The following table shows the changes in deferred revenue during the first half of fiscal year 2019:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Revenue related to remaining performance obligations represents the amount of contracted license and development arrangements and PCS that has not been recognized.
This amount excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.
Refer to Note 15 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including disaggregated revenue disclosures.
Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts allocated to inventory, as follows:

Equity Award Activity



The following is a summary of equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Of the total fair value of equity awards granted during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards that are not expected to vest was $12 million and $31 million, respectively.
Of the total fair value of equity awards granted during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards that are not expected to vest was $10 million and $39 million, respectively.
The following summarizes the aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense and estimated weighted average amortization period as of July 29, 2018 and January 28, 2018:

Note 4 – Net Income Per Share



The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares.
(2)Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.
The 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018, or the Convertible Notes, are included in the calculation of diluted net income per share.
The Convertible Notes have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the reporting period exceeds the adjusted conversion price of $20.02 per share.
The warrants associated with our Convertible Notes, or the Warrants, outstanding are also included in the calculation of diluted net income per share.
As of July 29, 2018, there were no warrants outstanding.
Refer to Note 12 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Convertible Notes and Note Hedges.
Note 5 – Income Taxes



We recognized income tax expense of $79 million and $146 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, respectively, and $101 million and $130 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, respectively.
Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019 was 6.7% and 5.9%, respectively, and 14.8% and 10.7% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, respectively.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of U.S. tax reform, partially offset by a decrease in the impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

(Unaudited)



In December 2017, the SEC issued guidance that allows companies to record provisional amounts for the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Job Acts, or TCJA, during a measurement period not to exceed one year.
The TCJA was effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 and we have recorded provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects.
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we have not recorded any adjustments to our provisional amounts.
Given the complexity of the GILTI provisions, we are still evaluating its effects and have not yet determined our accounting policy.
We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period.
As of July 29, 2018, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
On August 1, 2018, the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of the Treasury issued proposed regulations relating to the one-time transition tax provision of the TCJA.
Any required adjustment must be recorded during the measurement period as determined in accordance with the SEC guidance.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The following table provides the breakdown of unrealized losses as of July 29, 2018, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The gross unrealized losses related to fixed income securities were primarily due to changes in interest rates, which we believe are temporary in nature.
We have the intent and ability to hold our investments until maturity.
For the second quarter and first half of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, there were no other-than-temporary impairment losses and net realized gains were not significant.
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of cash equivalents and marketable securities as of July 29, 2018 and January 28, 2018 are shown below by contractual maturity.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Note 7 – Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities



The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets.
We review fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis.
There were no significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2 financial assets and liabilities for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Refer to Note 12 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Note 8 - Amortizable Intangible Assets



The components of our amortizable intangible assets are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The increase in gross carrying amount of intangible assets is due to purchases of licensed technology during the first half of fiscal year 2019.
Amortization expense associated with intangible assets was $6 million and $17 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, respectively, and $14 million and $29 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, respectively.
Future amortization expense related to the net carrying amount of intangible assets as of July 29, 2018 is estimated to be $12 million for the remainder of fiscal year 2019, $20 million in fiscal year 2020, $11 million in fiscal year 2021, $4 million in fiscal year 2022, $3 million in fiscal year 2023, and $1 million in fiscal 2024.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(2)Deferred revenue primarily includes deferrals related to license and development arrangements and PCS.
Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments



We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses.
We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis.
The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of July 29, 2018 and January 28, 2018.
We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar.
These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of July 29, 2018 and January 28, 2018:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of July 29, 2018, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months.
Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.
Note 11 - Guarantees



U.S. GAAP requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee.
Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities



We record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized primarily based on historical return rates.
Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products.
The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty liabilities was $16 million and $15 million as of July 29, 2018 and January 28, 2018, respectively.
Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability.
Note 12 - Debt



Long-Term Debt



2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026



In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021, and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the Notes.
Interest on the Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year, beginning on March 16, 2017.
Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium.
However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026.
The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs.

The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.
All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.
The carrying value of the Notes and the associated interest rates were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Convertible Debt



1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018



In fiscal year 2014, we issued $1.50 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018.
Through the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we had settled an aggregate of $1.49 billion of the Convertible Notes.
The Convertible Notes will mature on December 1, 2018 and we had $14 million in principal amount outstanding as of July 29, 2018.
Effective August 1, 2018, holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes before the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of December 1, 2018 regardless of conversion conditions.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we paid cash to settle an insignificant amount of the Convertible Notes.
Subsequently, we received additional conversion notices for an aggregate of $11 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes which are expected to be settled in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Based on the closing price of our common stock of $252.02 on the last trading day of the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, the if-converted value of the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $162 million.
As of July 29, 2018, the conversion rate was 49.94 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes.
Note Hedges



Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into the Note Hedges.
The Note Hedges have an adjusted strike price of $20.02 per share and allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would deliver and/or pay, respectively, to the holders of the Convertible Notes upon conversion.
Through July 29, 2018, we had received 56 million shares of our common stock from the exercise of a portion of the Note Hedges related to the settlement of $1.49 billion in principal amount of the Convertible Notes.
Revolving Credit Facility



We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million.
As of July 29, 2018, we had not borrowed any amounts under this agreement.
Commercial Paper



We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes.
As of July 29, 2018, we had not issued any commercial paper.

Note 14 - Shareholders’ Equity 



Capital Return Program 



Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.
During the first half of fiscal year 2019, we repurchased a total of 3 million shares for $655 million.
During the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, we also paid $91 million and $182 million, respectively, in cash dividends to our shareholders.
Through July 29, 2018, we have repurchased an aggregate of 254 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $6.16 billion.
All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock.
As of July 29, 2018, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $1.16 billion through December 2020.
Preferred Stock



As of July 29, 2018 and January 28, 2018, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.
Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments.
We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying architecture.
While our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for artificial intelligence, or AI, data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users.
Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.

(Unaudited)



Under the single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business.
In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most.
Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis.
Reportable segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported.
The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for NVIDIA as a whole.
