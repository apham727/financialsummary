The Company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not economically hedged.
Avnet’s exposure to such risks has not changed materially since July 1, 2017, as the Company continues to economically hedge the majority of its foreign currency exchange exposures.
Thus, any increase or decrease in fair value of the Company’s forward foreign currency exchange contracts is generally offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged position.
For interest rate risk, the Company continues to maintain a combination of fixed and variable rate debt to mitigate the exposure to fluctuation in market interest rates.
The Company’s exposure to market price risk related to marketable securities is mitigated through the purchase of a derivative financial instrument that economically fixes the value of the marketable securities.
