Item 3.
During the first half of 2019, the U.S. Dollar was stronger against most other currencies in which the Company pays its expenses.
In comparing average exchange rates during the first half of 2019 versus those during the first half of 2018, the Euro depreciated by 7%, the Pound depreciated by 6%, the Peso depreciated by 1% and the Renminbi depreciated by 6% against the U.S. Dollar.
This offset the foreign exchange loss recognized in the first half of 2019 of $0.1 million on translation of local currency balance sheet accounts to the U.S. Dollar in consolidation, resulting from foreign currency fluctuations since December 31, 2018.
Refer to Item 7A, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for further discussion of market risks.
