 Item 3.
Concentration of Revenue and Credit Risk  



Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables.
Cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposits and certain investments, such as commercial paper, corporate debt and municipal securities, with maturities less than 90 days.
Deposits of cash held outside the United States totaled approximately $17.6 million and $21.1 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
We grant credit to customers in the ordinary course of business.
Credit evaluations are performed on an ongoing basis to reduce credit risk, and no collateral is required from our customers.
An allowance for uncollectible accounts is provided for those accounts receivable considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and credit evaluation.
As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, one customer individually accounted for 12.8% and 10.8% of our gross accounts receivable, respectively.
Historically, we have not recorded material losses due to customers nonpayment.
Our Creative Professional business consists of a higher volume of lower dollar value transactions.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.
Interest Rate Risk  



Our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt.
At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility of $70.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively.
The interest rate on our Credit Facility fluctuates with either the prime rate or the LIBOR interest rate and at March 31, 2019, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.6% for LIBOR.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, a 10% increase in the rate would have increased our annual interest expense by $0.2 million.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  



In accordance with ASC Topic No.
830, Foreign Currency Matters, or ASC 830, all assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate as of the balance sheet date or historical rates, as appropriate.
As discussed in Note 1, our wholly-owned Olapic Argentina S.A. subsidiary employs 99 people whose functions mainly include development, sales support and administration.
The Argentinian economy was recently determined to be highly inflationary.
Argentinas inflation rate reached this threshold with the quarterly period ended June 30, 2018.
In accordance with this designation,

 we were required to apply the guidance in ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters, (Subtopic ASC 830-10-45-10), and account for a change in functional currency from the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar effective July 1, 2018.
While we conduct our operation in Argentine pesos, effective July 1, 2018, the functional currency was changed to the U.S. dollar.
The operation is a service center supporting the companys products and generates no revenue.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, revenue from customers outside the United States, particularly EMEA and Japan, comprised 54.8% and 56.2 %, respectively, of our total revenue.
In the period from that date until payment in the customers functional currency is received and converted into U.S. dollars, we can incur realized gains and losses.
We are currently utilizing 30-day forward contracts to mitigate our exposure on these currency fluctuations.
Any increase or decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged assets of our consolidated foreign affiliate.
At March 31, 2019, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.6 million British pound sterling and to purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value.
At December 31, 2018, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.7 million British pound sterling and to purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value.
