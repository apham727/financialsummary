Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



Basis of Presentation



The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include Belden Inc. and all of its subsidiaries (the Company, us, we, or our).
We eliminate all significant affiliate accounts and transactions in consolidation.
The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented as of any date other than December 31, 2018:



•Are prepared from the books and records without audit, and



•Are prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete statements, but



•Include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements.
These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Business Description



We are a global supplier of specialty networking solutions built around two global business platforms - Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions.
Our comprehensive portfolio of solutions enables customers to transmit and secure data, sound, and video for mission critical applications across complex enterprise and industrial environments.
Reporting Periods



Our fiscal year and fiscal fourth quarter both end on December 31.
Our fiscal first quarter ends on the Sunday falling closest to 91 days after December 31, which was March 31, 2019, the 90th day of our fiscal year 2019.
Our fiscal second and third quarters each have 91 days.
The nine months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 included 272 and 273 days, respectively.
The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows:



•Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;



•Level 2 – Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and



•Level 3 – Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
As of and during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we utilized Level 1 inputs to determine the fair value of cash equivalents, and we utilized Level 2 and Level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations (see Note 3).
We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the nine months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018.
Cash and Cash Equivalents



We classify cash on hand and deposits in banks, including commercial paper, money market accounts, and other investments with an original maturity of three months or less, that we hold from time to time, as cash and cash equivalents.
We periodically have cash equivalents consisting of short-term money market funds and other investments.
As of September 29, 2019, we did not have any such cash equivalents on hand.
The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations.
- 7-



Contingent Liabilities



We have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies that are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable, the amounts of which are currently not material.
We accrue environmental remediation costs based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposures developed in consultation with our environmental consultants and legal counsel.
We are, from time to time, subject to routine litigation incidental to our business.
As of September 29, 2019, we were party to standby letters of credit, bank guaranties, and surety bonds totaling $9.7 million, $3.9 million, and $3.3 million, respectively.
Revenue Recognition



We recognize revenue consistent with the principles as outlined in the following five step model: (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.
See Note 2.
See Note 17.
Current-Year Adoption of Accounting Pronouncements



In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02"), a leasing standard for both lessees and lessors that supersedes the lease requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 840, "Leases."
Under its core principle, a lessee will recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for nearly all leased assets, and additional disclosures are required to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
Lessor accounting remains largely consistent with existing U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 using the permitted transition method issued in July 2018, under ASU No.
2018-11 (“ASU 2018-11”), Leases: Targeted Improvements, which provides an additional (and optional) transition method for adopting the new lease standard.
Furthermore, we elected the following practical expedients and accounting policy elections upon adoption: (i) the package of practical expedients as defined in ASU 2016-02, (ii) the short-term lease accounting policy election, (iii) the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components, and (iv) the easement practical expedient, which permits an entity to continue applying its current policy for accounting for land easements that existed as of the effective date of ASU 2016-02.
The adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets of approximately $90.5 million and lease liabilities for operating leases of approximately $103.4 million on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, with no material impact to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations or Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.
The difference between the initial lease liabilities and the ROU assets is related primarily to previously existing lease liabilities.
See Note 7 for further information regarding the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company's financial statements.
In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”).
The new guidance also makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance and ease the administrative burden of hedge documentation requirements and assessing hedge effectiveness.
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
We adopted ASU 2017-12 effective January 1, 2019.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
- 8-



In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
2018-07 (“ASU 2018-07”), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
The amendments in ASU 2018-07 expand the scope of Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees, and provide that non-employee share-based payment awards be measured at their grant-date fair value and the probability of satisfying performance conditions be taken into account when non-employee share-based payment awards contain such conditions.
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
We adopted ASU 2018-07 effective January 1, 2019.
In August 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) adopted the final rule under SEC Release No.
33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification, amending certain disclosure requirements that were redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated or superseded.
Additionally, the amendments expanded the disclosure requirements on the analysis of stockholders' equity for interim financial statements.
Under the amendments, an analysis of changes in each caption of stockholders' equity presented in the balance sheet must be provided in a note or separate statement.
The analysis should present a reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance of each period presented.
This final rule was effective on November 5, 2018.
We implemented SEC Release No.
Pending Adoption of Recent Accounting Pronouncements



In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-13 (“ASU 2016-13”), Financial Instruments - Credit Losses.
The new standard will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2020.
Early adoption is permitted.
The following tables present our revenues disaggregated by major product category.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 - 9-



The following tables present our revenues disaggregated by geography, based on the location of the customer purchasing the product.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The following tables present our revenues disaggregated by products, including software products, and support and services.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We generate revenues primarily by selling products that provide secure and reliable transmission of data, sound, and video for mission critical applications.
We also generate revenues from providing support and professional services.
We sell our products to distributors, end-users, installers, and directly to original equipment manufacturers.
At times, we enter into arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple performance obligations.
For these arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative selling price and recognized when or as each performance obligation is satisfied.
Generally, we determine relative selling price using the prices charged to customers on a standalone basis.
Adjustments to revenue for performance obligations satisfied in prior periods were not significant during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018.
The following table presents estimated and accrued variable consideration:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Depending on the terms of an arrangement, we may defer the recognition of some or all of the consideration received because we have to satisfy a future obligation.
Consideration allocated to support services under a support and maintenance contract is typically paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the service.
Consideration allocated to professional services is typically recognized when or as the services are performed depending on the terms of the arrangement.
As of September 29, 2019, total deferred revenue was $99.2 million, and of this amount, $86.5 million is expected to be recognized within the next twelve months, and the remaining $12.7 million is long-term and is expected to be recognized over a period greater than twelve months.
Total capitalized sales commissions was $3.0 million as of September 29, 2019 and $2.3 million as of September 30, 2018.
The following table presents sales commissions that are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Note 3: Acquisitions



Opterna International Corp.



We acquired 100% of the shares of Opterna International Corp. (Opterna) on April 15, 2019 for a preliminary purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $51.7 million.
Of the $51.7 million purchase price, $45.5 million and $0.4 million was paid on April 15, 2019 and September 25, 2019, respectively, with cash on hand.
The acquisition included a potential earnout, which is based upon future Opterna financial targets through April 15, 2021.
The maximum earnout consideration is $25.0 million, but based upon a third party valuation specialist using certain assumptions in a discounted cash flow model, the estimated fair value of the earnout included 



 - 11-



in the purchase price is $5.8 million.
Opterna is an international fiber optics solutions business based in Sterling, Virginia, which designs and manufactures a range of complementary fiber connectivity, cabinet, and enclosure products used in optical networks.
Certain subsidiaries of Opterna include noncontrolling interests.
Because Opterna has a controlling financial interest in these subsidiaries, they are consolidated into our financial statements.
The results that are attributable to the noncontrolling interest holders are presented as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
An immaterial amount of Opterna's revenues are generated from transactions with the noncontrolling interests.
The following table summarizes the estimated, preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as of April 15, 2019 (in thousands):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The above purchase price allocation is preliminary, and is subject to revision as additional information about the fair value of individual assets and liabilities becomes available.
A change in the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired or noncontrolling interests will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill.
During the third quarter 2019, we recorded measurement-period adjustments that decreased goodwill by approximately $9.4 million primarily for changes in the fair value of the earnout.
The impact of these adjustments to the consolidated statement of operations was immaterial.
The preliminary fair value of acquired receivables is $5.3 million, which is equivalent to its gross contractual amount.
For purposes of the above allocation, we based our preliminary estimate of the fair values for the acquired inventory, intangible assets, and noncontrolling interests on valuation studies performed by a third party valuation firm.
We used various valuation methods including discounted cash flows, lost income, excess earnings, and relief from royalty to estimate the preliminary fair value of the identifiable intangible assets (Level 3 valuation).
- 12-



Our preliminary estimate of the fair values for the noncontrolling interests were based on the comparable EBITDA multiple valuation technique (Level 3 valuation).
Goodwill and other intangible assets reflected above were determined to meet the criteria for recognition apart from tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The goodwill is primarily attributable to expansion of product offerings in the optical fiber market.
The intangible assets related to the acquisition consisted of the following:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The amortizable intangible assets reflected in the table above were determined by us to have finite lives.
The useful life for the customer relationship intangible asset was based on our forecasts of estimated sales from recurring customers.
The useful life of the backlog intangible asset was based on our estimate of when the ordered items would ship and control of the items transfers.
The useful life for the trademarks was based on the period of time we expect to continue to go to market using the trademarks.
Our consolidated revenues for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019 included $9.1 million and $17.9 million, respectively, from Opterna.
Our consolidated loss before taxes for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019 included $(0.2) million and $(0.3) million, respectively, from Opterna.
For the three months ended September 29, 2019, the loss before taxes included $3.1 million of severance and other restructuring costs, $1.4 million of amortization of intangible assets, and $(0.1) million of cost of sales related to the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value.
For the nine months ended September 29, 2019, the loss before taxes included $5.6 million of severance and other restructuring costs, $2.3 million of amortization of intangible assets, and $0.5 million of cost of sales related to the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value.
Our consolidated loss for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019 included $0.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of Opterna.
The following table illustrates the unaudited pro forma effect on operating results as if the Opterna acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2018.
Pro forma adjustments exclude cost savings from any synergies resulting from the acquisition.
FutureLink



We acquired the FutureLink product line and related assets from Suttle, Inc. on April 5, 2019 for a purchase price of $5.0 million, which was funded with cash on hand.
The acquisition of FutureLink allows us to offer a more complete set of fiber product offerings.
Net-Tech Technology, Inc.



We acquired 100% of the shares of Net-Tech Technology, Inc. (NT2) on April 25, 2018 for a purchase price of $8.5 million, which was funded with cash on hand.
NT2 is an integrator of optical passive components and network optimization products used within broadband network applications where optical backhaul is used.
NT2 is located in the United States.
Snell Advanced Media



We acquired 100% of the outstanding ownership interest in Snell Advanced Media (SAM) on February 8, 2018 for a purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $104.6 million.
Of the $104.6 million purchase price, $75.2 million was paid on February 8, 2018 and was funded with cash on hand.
The acquisition included a potential earnout, which is based upon future combined earnings of SAM and Grass Valley through December 31, 2019.
The maximum earnout consideration is $31.4 million, but based upon a third party valuation specialist using certain assumptions in a discounted cash flow model, the estimated fair value of the earnout included in the purchase price was $29.3 million.
We assumed debt of $19.3 million and paid it off during the first quarter of 2018.
During the first quarter of 2019, we signed a settlement agreement with the sellers of SAM for claims arising over the timing of the earnout consideration outlined in the purchase agreement, and as part of the settlement, the parties agreed that the maximum earnout consideration of $31.4 million would be payable during the first quarter 2020, unless earlier payment is required as per the terms of the purchase agreement.
SAM designs, manufactures, and sells innovative content production and distribution systems for the broadcast and media markets.
SAM is located in the United Kingdom.
The fair value of acquired receivables is $16.6 million, which is equivalent to its gross contractual amount.
For purposes of the above allocation, we based our estimate of the fair values for the acquired inventory; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and deferred revenue on valuation studies performed by a third party valuation firm.
To determine the value of the acquired property, plant, and equipment, we used various valuation methods, including both the market approach, which considers sales prices of similar assets in similar conditions (Level 2 valuation), and the cost approach, which considers the cost to replace the asset adjusted for depreciation (Level 3 valuation).
We used various valuation methods including discounted cash flows, lost income, excess earnings, and relief from royalty to estimate the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets and deferred revenue (Level 3 valuation).
Goodwill and other intangible assets reflected above were determined to meet the criteria for recognition apart from tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies and the assembled workforce.
The expected synergies for the SAM acquisition may be gained from helping broadcast and media content creators, aggregators and distributors significantly improve their effectiveness and efficiency during a period of rapid change in technology, viewer and advertiser behavior and business models.
The intangible assets related to the acquisition consisted of the following:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The amortizable intangible assets reflected in the table above were determined by us to have finite lives.
The useful life for the customer relationship intangible asset was based on our forecasts of estimated sales from recurring customers.
The useful life of the backlog intangible asset was based on our estimate of when the ordered items would ship.
The useful life for the trademarks was based on the period of time we expect to continue to go to market using the trademarks.
SAM is included in our Grass Valley reporting unit, and as discussed further in Note 8, during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, we recognized a total goodwill and other asset impairment charge of $342.1 million for the Grass Valley reporting unit.
Our consolidated revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 included an estimated $25.3 million and $77.2 million, respectively, from SAM.
Due to the integration of SAM into our existing business, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount of income before taxes from SAM included in our consolidated financial statements.
Our consolidated income before 



 - 15-



taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2018 included $7.1 million of severance and other restructuring costs, $3.7 million of amortization of intangible assets, and $0.6 million of cost of sales related to the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value from SAM.
Our consolidated income before taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 included $36.6 million of severance and other restructuring costs, $8.7 million of amortization of intangible assets, and $1.8 million of cost of sales related to the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value from SAM.
The following table illustrates the unaudited pro forma effect on operating results as if the SAM acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2017.
Pro forma adjustments exclude cost savings from any synergies resulting from the acquisition.
Note 4: Reportable Segments



We are organized around two global business platforms: Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions.
Each of the global business platforms represents a reportable segment.
The key measures of segment profit or loss are Segment Revenues and Segment EBITDA.
Segment EBITDA excludes certain items, including depreciation expense; amortization of intangibles; asset impairment; severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; purchase accounting effects related to acquisitions, such as the adjustment of acquired inventory and deferred revenue to fair value; and other costs.
We allocate corporate expenses to the segments for purposes of measuring Segment EBITDA.
Corporate expenses are allocated on the basis of each segment’s relative EBITDA prior to the allocation.
Our measure of segment assets does not include cash, goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets, or corporate assets.
All goodwill is allocated to reporting units of our segments for purposes of impairment testing.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Our segment results include revenues that would have been recorded by acquired businesses had they remained as independent entities.
See Note 3, Acquisitions, for details.
(2) For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, we recognized a $342.1 million goodwill and other asset impairment charge for our Grass Valley reporting unit.
See Note 8, Long-Lived Assets, for details.
(3) See Note 9, Severance, Restructuring, and Acquisition Integration Activities, for details.
(4) For the nine months ended September 29, 2019, we recognized expenses related to the earnout consideration for the SAM acquisition.
For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, we recognized cost of sales for the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value related to the Opterna and FutureLink acquisitions.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, we recognized cost of sales for the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value related to the SAM and NT2 acquisitions.
Note 5: Income per Share



The following table presents the basis for the income per share computations:



 - 18-



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include outstanding equity awards of 1.4 million and 1.2 million, respectively, because to do so would have been anti-dilutive.
In addition, for both the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include outstanding equity awards of 0.3 million because the related performance conditions have not been satisfied.
Furthermore, for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include the weighted average impact of 1.1 million and 4.9 million shares, respectively, related to converting preferred shares into common shares because deducting the preferred stock dividends from net income was more dilutive.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include outstanding equity awards of 0.9 million and 0.8 million, respectively, because to do so would have been anti-dilutive.
In addition, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include outstanding equity awards of 0.3 million and 0.2 million, respectively, because the related performance conditions have not been satisfied.
Furthermore, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include the impact of preferred shares that were converted into 6.9 million common shares, because deducting the preferred stock dividends from net income was more dilutive.
For purposes of calculating basic earnings per share, unvested restricted stock units are not included in the calculation of basic weighted average shares outstanding until all necessary conditions have been satisfied and issuance of the shares underlying the restricted stock units is no longer contingent.
For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, unvested restricted stock units are included to the extent that they are dilutive.
In determining whether unvested restricted stock units are dilutive, each issuance of restricted stock units is considered separately.
Once a restricted stock unit has vested, it is included in the calculation of both basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
Note 6: Inventories



The major classes of inventories were as follows:



 - 19-



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Note 7: Leases



We have operating and finance leases for properties, including manufacturing facilities, warehouses, and office space; as well as vehicles and certain equipment.
We make certain judgments in determining whether a contract contains a lease in accordance with ASU 2016-02.
Our leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to 16 years, some of which include options to extend the lease for a period of up to 15 years and some include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.
We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably certain as of the commencement date of the lease.
We have entered into various short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less.
These leases are not recorded on our balance sheet, and for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, the rent expense for short-term leases was not material.
As the rate implicit in most of our lease is not readily determinable, we use the incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments, which is unique to each leased asset, and is based upon the term of the lease, commencement date of the lease, local currency of the leased asset, and the credit rating of the legal entity leasing the asset.
The components of lease expense were as follows:

Note 8: Long-Lived Assets



Depreciation and Amortization Expense



We recognized depreciation expense of $12.1 million and $37.2 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively.
We recognized depreciation expense of $11.7 million and $35.6 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
We recognized amortization expense related to our intangible assets of $23.4 million and $71.2 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019.
We recognized amortization expense related to our intangible assets of $26.2 million and $76.3 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
- 21-



Impairment



Due to its overall financial performance during the fiscal third quarter and a potential divestiture of the reporting unit, we performed an interim impairment test on the Grass Valley reporting unit, which resulted in a total goodwill and other asset impairment charge of $342.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019.
The Grass Valley reporting unit is part of our Enterprise Solutions Segment.
The impairment charge consisted of impairments to goodwill, customer relationships, and trademarks of $326.1 million, $14.4 million, and $1.6 million, respectively.
Note 9: Severance, Restructuring, and Acquisition Integration Activities



Opterna and FutureLink Integration program: 2019



In 2019, we began a restructuring program to integrate Opterna and FutureLink with our existing businesses.
The restructuring and integration activities were focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions.
We recognized $3.1 million and $5.6 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively.
These costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment.
Grass Valley and SAM Integration Program: 2018 - 2019



In 2018, we began a restructuring program to integrate SAM with Grass Valley.
The restructuring and integration activities were focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions.
We did not recognize severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three months ended September 29, 2019, and we recognized $3.0 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the nine months ended September 29, 2019.
We recognized $7.1 million and $36.6 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment.
The integration of these businesses is complete, and thus, we do not expect to incur any more costs for this program.
Industrial Manufacturing Footprint Program: 2016 - 2018



In 2016, we began a program to consolidate our manufacturing footprint.
The manufacturing consolidation was complete as of December 31, 2018.
We recognized $4.3 million and $15.8 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018.
The following table summarizes the costs by segment of the various programs described above as well as other immaterial programs and acquisition integration activities:

The following table summarizes the costs of the various programs described above as well as other immaterial programs and acquisition integration activities by financial statement line item in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The other restructuring and integration costs primarily consisted of equipment transfer, costs to consolidate operating and support facilities, retention bonuses, relocation, travel, legal, and other costs.
The majority of the other restructuring and integration costs related to these actions were paid as incurred or are payable within the next 60 days.
There were no significant severance accrual balances as of September 29, 2019 or December 31, 2018.
Note 10: Long-Term Debt and Other Borrowing Arrangements



The carrying values of our long-term debt were as follows:



 - 23-



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Revolving Credit Agreement due 2022



Our Revolving Credit Agreement provides a $400.0 million multi-currency asset-based revolving credit facility (the Revolver).
The borrowing base under the Revolver includes eligible accounts receivable; inventory; and property, plant and equipment of certain of our subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada, Germany, and the Netherlands.
The maturity date of the Revolver is May 16, 2022.
Interest on outstanding borrowings is variable, based upon LIBOR or other similar indices in foreign jurisdictions, plus a spread that ranges from 1.25%-1.75%, depending upon our leverage position.
In the event we borrow more than 90% of our borrowing base, we are subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant.
Senior Subordinated Notes



We have outstanding €350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior subordinated notes due 2028 (the 2028 Notes).
The carrying value of the 2028 Notes as of September 29, 2019 is $383.5 million.
The 2028 Notes rank equal in right of payment with our senior subordinated notes due 2027, 2026, and 2025 and with any future subordinated debt, and they are subordinated to all of our senior debt and the senior debt of our subsidiary guarantors, including our Revolver.
Interest is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year.

Note 17: Subsequent Events



Assets Held for Sale



We classify assets and liabilities as held for sale (disposal group) when management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group, the sale is probable within one year, and the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
We also consider whether an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated, whether the disposal group is marketed actively for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and whether actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we committed to a plan to sell Grass Valley, and at such time, met all of the criteria to classify the assets and liabilities of this business as held for sale.
As a result, the Grass Valley disposal group, which is currently part of the Enterprise Solutions segment, will be included in discontinued operations commencing in the fourth quarter.
We also ceased 



 - 27-



depreciating and amortizing the assets of the disposal group once they met the held for sale criteria in the fourth quarter.
We intend to complete the sale of the Grass Valley disposal group during the next twelve months.
As discussed in Note 8, we recognized an impairment charge for the disposal group of $342.1 million during the third quarter of 2019, which consisted of impairments to goodwill, customer relationships, and trademarks of $326.1 million, $14.4 million, and $1.6 million, respectively.
As of September 29, 2019, Grass Valley had total assets and total liabilities of $491.8 million and $194.0 million, respectively, and accumulated other comprehensive losses of $73.2 million.
Our comprehensive portfolio of solutions enables customers to transmit and secure data, sound, and video for mission critical applications across complex enterprise and industrial environments.
We strive for operational excellence through the execution of our Belden Business System, which includes three areas of focus: Lean enterprise initiatives, our Market Delivery System, and our Talent Management System.
Through operational excellence we generate free cash flow on an annual basis.
We utilize the cash flow generated by our business to fuel our continued transformation and generate shareholder value.
We believe our business system, balance across markets and geographies, systematic go-to-market approach, extensive portfolio of innovative solutions, commitment to Lean principles, and improving margins present a unique value proposition for shareholders.
We consider revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flows, and return on invested capital to be our key operating performance indicators.
We also seek to acquire businesses that we believe can help us achieve these objectives.
Foreign currency



Our exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relates to exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the euro, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, British pound, Indian rupee, and Brazilian real.
During the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, approximately 48% of our consolidated revenues were to customers outside of the U.S.
As such, all references to the effect of channel inventory changes are estimates.
Our strategic goal is to utilize our Market Delivery System to target faster growing geographies, applications, and trends within our end markets, in order to achieve growth that is higher than the general market growth rate.
To the extent that we exceed the market growth rates, we consider it to be the result of capturing market share.
Acquisitions



We completed the acquisitions of Opterna International Corp. (Opterna) on April 15, 2019 and FutureLink on April 5, 2019.
See Note 3.
Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment

See Note 8.
Opterna and FutureLink Integration Program



In 2019, we began a restructuring program to integrate Opterna and FutureLink with our existing businesses.
The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions.
We recognized $3.1 million and $5.6 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively.
The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment.
Grass Valley and SAM Integration Program



In 2018, we began a restructuring program to integrate SAM with Grass Valley.
The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions.
We recognized $3.0 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the nine months ended September 29, 2019.
The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment.
The integration of these businesses is complete, and thus, we do not expect to incur any more costs for this program.
Preferred Stock Conversion



On July 15, 2019, all outstanding Preferred Stock was automatically converted into shares of Belden common stock at the conversion rate of 132.50, resulting in the issuance of approximately 6.9 million shares of Belden common stock.
Upon conversion, the Preferred Stock was automatically extinguished and discharged, is no longer deemed outstanding for all purposes, and delisted from trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
During the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, dividends on the Preferred Stock were $1.0 million and $18.4 million, respectively.
See Note 15.
Subsequent Events

We intend to complete the sale of the Grass Valley disposal group during the next twelve months.
During the fourth quarter, we announced a cost reduction program designed to improve performance and enhance margins by streamlining the organizational structure and investing in technology to drive productivity.

 - 31-



and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 29, 2019 as compared to the year ago period; partially offset by the impact of acquisitions, which increased selling, general and administrative expenses by $9.1 million.

The loss on debt extinguishment recognized in 2018 represents the premium paid to the bond holders to retire a portion of the 2023 and 2024 notes and the unamortized debt issuance costs written-off.
Income (loss) before taxes decreased $412.4 million and $379.3 million in the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2018.
The decrease is primarily a result of the operating loss during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2019; partially offset by the loss on debt extinguishment in the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
