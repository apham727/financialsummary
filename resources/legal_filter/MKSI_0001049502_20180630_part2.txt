 ITEM 1A.
General trade tensions between the U.S. and China have been escalating in 2018, with one round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods taking effect in July 2018, and a second round expected to be implemented before the end of September 2018.
In July 2018, the Trump Administration proposed a new list of thousands of categories of goods, including electronics, that could face tariffs of 10%.
The Trump Administration subsequently proposed that the third round tariffs be increased from 10% to 25%.
Additionally, the Trump Administration continues to signal that it may alter trade agreements and terms between China and the United States, including limiting trade with China, and may impose additional tariffs on imports from China.
