There are references to the impact of foreign currency translation in the discussion of the Company’s results of operations.
In the discussion that follows, results excluding this impact, primarily for subsidiaries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia/Pacific, are referred to as “constant currency.”  



 In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”), the Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial information, including:  



   ·    Sales adjusted for certain items that impact the year-over-year analysis, which includes the impact of certain acquisitions by adjusting Avnet’s prior periods to include the sales of acquired businesses, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes.
However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

24  



 Table of Contents  



 The Company evaluates each quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than their carrying value, which would require the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test.
Each fiscal year, during the fiscal fourth quarter, the Company is required to perform an annual goodwill impairment test.
The annual goodwill impairment testing typically includes consideration of the Company’s annual long-term planning as well as current market conditions when determining whether there is a goodwill impairment for any of the Company’s reporting units.
The results of a quantitative annual goodwill impairment test may result in the impairment of goodwill at one or more of the Company’s reporting units even if a qualitative assessment concludes that goodwill is not impaired.
These costs also related to the continued transformation of the Company’s information technology, distribution center footprint and business operations including the re-prioritization of its information technology initiatives and resources.
In addition, the Company incurred integration, accelerated depreciation and other costs.
Integration costs are primarily related to the integration of acquired businesses including Farnell, the integration of certain regional and global businesses including Avnet after the sale of the TS business, and incremental costs incurred as part of the consolidation, relocation, sale and closure of warehouse and office facilities.
Accelerated depreciation relates to the incremental depreciation expense incurred related to the shortening of the estimated useful life for certain information technology assets and from the integration of Farnell.
The Company recorded restructuring, integration and other expenses of $2.9 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company also incurred integration costs of $2.4 million, accelerated depreciation expense of $2.7 million, partially offset by a gain on the sale of real estate of $15.1 million and a reversal of $0.5 million for changes in estimates for costs associated with prior year restructuring actions.
The after tax impact of restructuring, integration and other expenses were $2.6 million and $0.02 per share on a diluted basis.
The after tax impact of restructuring, integration and other expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was $60.7 million and $0.54 per share on a diluted basis.

The increase in interest and other financing expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 was primarily related to increased expenses in foreign regions to finance working capital needs including increases in average debt outstanding and from lower interest income from investments in cash equivalents between the fiscal years.

Contractual Obligations  



 For a detailed description of the Company’s long-term debt and lease commitments for the next five years and thereafter, see Long-Term Contractual Obligations appearing in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
With the exception of the Company’s debt transactions discussed herein, there are no material changes to this information outside of normal borrowings and repayments of long-term debt and operating lease payments.
Financing Transactions  



 See Note 5, “Debt” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on financing transactions including the Credit Facility, the Securitization Program, and other outstanding debt as of March 30, 2019.
The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program as of March 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.
The Company has various lines of credit, financing arrangements and other forms of bank debt in the U.S. and various foreign locations to fund the short-term working capital, foreign exchange, overdraft and letter of credit needs of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Outstanding borrowings under such forms of debt at the end of third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.8 million.
28  



 Table of Contents  



 As an alternative form of financing outside of the United States, the Company sells certain of its trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements.
The Company accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Liquidity  



 The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $725.3 million as of March 30, 2019, of which $660.7 million was held outside the United States.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $621.1 million, of which $545.3 million was held outside of the United States.
As of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company had a combined total borrowing capacity of $1.75 billion under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program.
There were $85.6 million in borrowings outstanding and $3.0 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility and $447.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Securitization Program, resulting in approximately $1.21 billion of total availability as of March 30, 2019.
Availability under the Securitization Program is subject to the Company having sufficient eligible trade accounts receivable to support desired borrowings.
The Company currently expects to utilize availability under credit facilities to support working capital and other general corporate purposes to the extent such incremental borrowings do not impact the Company’s investment grade credit rating.
During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $29.8 million and $71.2 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility and approximately $456.0 million and $259.0 million, respectively, under the Securitization Program.

During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities.
Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth.
The Company generated $492.0 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended March 30, 2019 from continuing operations.
To the extent the cash balances held in foreign locations cannot be remitted back to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner, those cash balances are generally used for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure needs and to support acquisitions, and are currently expected to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S.
The Company is still evaluating the impact of repatriating any additional foreign cash as a result of the Act.
In addition, local government regulations may restrict the Company’s ability to move funds among various locations under certain circumstances.
Management does not believe such restrictions would limit the Company’s ability to pursue its intended business strategy.
Management believes that Avnet’s available borrowing capacity including capacity for the non-recourse sale of accounts receivable and the Company’s expected ability to generate operating cash flows in the future will be sufficient to meet its future liquidity needs.
Additionally, as the Company integrates Farnell, the Company expects to use cash for restructuring, integration and other expenses.
