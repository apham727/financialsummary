Net Sales 
The Company's total net sales from continuing operations in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended September 1, 2019 were $13.7 million and $28.7 million, respectively, compared to $11.2 million and $21.6 million in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks, respectively, ended August 26, 2018.

The higher gross profit margin for the 26 weeks ended September 1, 2019 compared to the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 was principally a result of higher sales and the partially fixed nature of overhead expenses in the 26 weeks ended September 1, 2019 compared to the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, partially offset by increased direct labor and supplies expenses.
