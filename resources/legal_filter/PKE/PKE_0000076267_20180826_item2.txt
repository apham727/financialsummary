Gross Profit 
The Company’s gross profit from continuing operations in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 was lower than its gross profit from continuing operations in the prior year’s comparable period, and the gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales for the Company’s worldwide operations in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 decreased to 28.1% from 28.3% in the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017.

The lower gross profit margin from continuing operations for the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017 was principally due to the lower sales in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017. The higher gross profit margin from continuing operations for the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017 was principally a result of higher sales in the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017.

Interest Expense 
Interest expense in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 27, 2017 related to the Company’s borrowings under the three-year revolving credit facility agreement that the Company entered into with HSBC Bank in the fourth quarter of the 2017 fiscal year. The agreement provided for an interest rate on the outstanding loan balance of LIBOR plus 1.15% to 2.65%. Other interest rate options were available to the Company under the agreement.

Interest income decreased 52% and 54%, respectively, for the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018 primarily as a result of lower average balances of marketable securities held by the Company in the 13 weeks and 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, compared to last fiscal year's comparable periods, partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates. During the 26 weeks ended August 26, 2018, the Company earned interest income principally from its investments, which consisted primarily of short-term instruments and money market funds.

The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 13 weeks ended August 26, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 27, 2017 primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges, partially offset by lower sales, compared to last year’s comparable period. The Company’s net earnings from discontinued operations were higher in the 26-week period ended August 26, 2018 than in last fiscal year’s comparable period, primarily as a result of lower restructuring charges and higher sales, compared to last year’s comparable period, and a one-time litigation expense of $375,000 in the 26-week period ended August 27, 2017. 
During the 2018 fiscal year, the Company consolidated its Nelco Products, Inc. Electronics Business Unit located in Fullerton, California and its Neltec, Inc.

accounts receivable decreased by 16% at August 26, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 primarily due to lower sales in the quarter ended August 26, 2018 than in the fourth quarter of the 2018 fiscal year;    
prepaid expenses increased by 7% at August 26, 2018 compared to February 25, 2018 primarily due to an increase in accrued interest on our marketable securities;

In addition, the Company paid $4.0 million in cash dividends in each of the 26-week periods ended August 26, 2018 and August 27, 2017.

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. This guidance requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and expands the related disclosure requirements. The new standard was originally scheduled to be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those fiscal years. In August 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date of this guidance for one year. With the delay, the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and the interim periods within those fiscal years, with an option to adopt the standard on the originally scheduled effective date. The Company has adopted the guidance effective February 26, 2018, the first day of the 2019 fiscal year, and the adoption of this guidance did not impact its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial position or disclosures.
