NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 



Note 1 – Basis of presentation 



The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2017, included in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the results of our operations and comprehensive income for three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, and the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.
Our operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2018.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Out of Period Adjustments



During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded a non-cash out of period adjustment of $2.3 million related to the deferral of gross profit associated with intercompany purchases from our equity-method investee that should have been recognized when realized, through transactions with third-parties, beginning in January 2011.
We evaluated the adjustment from a qualitative and quantitative perspective and concluded that the amount of income was not material to any individual prior quarter or year and that the cumulative out of period adjustment was not expected to be material to our full year 2018 results.
Earnings Per Share



Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding (if dilutive) during each period.
The number of common share equivalents, which includes restricted stock units (“RSUs”), is computed using the treasury stock method.
The reconciliation of the denominators used to calculate basic EPS and diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Stock awards to acquire 36,600 shares and 40,700 shares for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 537,000 shares and 22,300 shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were excluded in the computations of diluted EPS because the effect of including the stock awards would have been anti-dilutive.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



We adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments ("new revenue standard") as of January 1, 2018.
The impact of this new guidance on our accounting policies and operating results is described below.
There were no other significant changes in our accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
7



Accounts Receivable, net 



Accounts receivable are recorded net of allowances for doubtful accounts.
Our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical experience.
We analyze historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts.
Unbilled receivables represent amounts for which revenue has been recognized but which have not yet been invoiced to the customer.
The current portion of unbilled receivables is included in "accounts receivable, net" on the consolidated balance sheet and is not material.
Sales Tax 



Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected from our customers, are excluded from revenue.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



Revenue from Contracts with Customers



On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue standard using the modified retrospective transition method.
Under this method, we evaluated all contracts that were in effect at the beginning of 2018 as if those contracts had been accounted for under the new revenue standard.
We did not evaluate individual modifications for those periods prior to the adoption date, but the aggregate effect of all modifications as of the adoption date and such effects are provided below.
Under the modified retrospective transition approach, periods prior to the adoption date were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with historical GAAP.
A cumulative catch-up adjustment was recorded to beginning retained earnings to reflect the impact of all existing arrangements under the new revenue standard.
We do not expect the impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard to be material to our annual net income on an ongoing basis.
Historically, we have had to defer revenue for certain types of licenses arrangements and recognize revenue for such licenses ratably over the license term.
Under the new revenue standard, we are no longer required to establish vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") to recognize software license revenue separately from the other elements, and we are able to recognize all software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license, which will generally occur at the start of each license term.
The cumulative effects of the changes made to our consolidated January 1, 2018 balance sheet for the adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue - Revenue from Contracts with Customers were as follows (in thousands):

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



In August 2018, the SEC issued Release No.
33-10532 that amends and clarifies certain financial reporting requirements.
The principal change to our financial reporting will be the inclusion of the annual disclosure requirement of changes in stockholders’ equity in Rule 3-04 of Regulation S-X to interim periods.
We will adopt this new rule beginning with our financial reporting for the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
Upon adoption, we will include our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity with each quarterly filing on Form 10-Q.
In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") related to items that the FASB refers to as having been stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI").
The new guidance may be applied retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the Act is recognized or in the period of adoption.
We must adopt this guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is permitted for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued or made available for issuance, including the period the Act was enacted.
The guidance, when adopted, will require new disclosures regarding a company’s accounting policy for releasing the tax effects in accumulated OCI and permit the company the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Act that are stranded in accumulated OCI.
The adoption of ASU 2018-02 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
We do not plan to adopt the new standard prior to the required effective date and we do not plan to elect the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Act that are stranded in accumulated OCI.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.
The ASU simplifies certain aspects of hedge accounting and improves disclosures of hedging arrangements through the elimination of the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness.
The ASU generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item in order to align financial reporting of hedge relationships with the associated economic results.
Entities must apply the amendments to cash flow and net investment hedge relationships that exist on the date of adoption using a modified retrospective approach.
The presentation and disclosure requirements must be applied prospectively.
Our effective date for adoption of this guidance is our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019.
We are currently evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes ASC 840, Leases.
The guidance requires lessees to recognize most lease liabilities on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice.
The update states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
The update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted.We do not expect to adopt the new standard prior to the required effective date.
We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
We have completed a qualitative and quantitative assessment of our lease portfolio and are in the process of testing our new real estate lease accounting system, collecting data for leases entered into during 2018 and implementing new processes and controls to account for our leases in accordance with the new standard.
As permitted by ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, we do not expect to adjust comparative-period financial statements.

Note 2 - Revenue 



Revenue Recognition



Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.
We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of our products or services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Nature of Goods and Services 



We derive revenues from two primary sources: products and software maintenance.
Product revenues are primarily generated from the sale of off-the-shelf modular test and measurement hardware components and related drivers, and application software licenses.
Sales of most hardware components may also include optional extended hardware warranties, which typically provide additional service-type coverage for three years from the purchase date.
Our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software.
We also offer some term-based software licenses that expire, which are referred to as subscription arrangements.
We do not customize software for customers and installation services are not required.
The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates and technical support.
We sell our customer support contracts as a percentage of net software purchases the support is related.
Revenues from offerings related to our hardware and software products such as extended hardware warranties, training, consulting and installation services are not significant and presented within product revenues, as further discussed below.
Software maintenance revenues consists of post contract customer support that provides the customer with unspecified upgrades and technical support.
For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct.
The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis.
Standalone selling prices of software licenses are estimated based on our established pricing practices and maximize the use of observable inputs.
Standalone selling prices of hardware products are typically estimated based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis.
Our typical performance obligations include the following:



Performance ObligationWhen performance obligation is typically satisfiedWhen payment is typically dueHow standalone selling price is typically estimated



Product revenue



Modular hardwareWhen customer obtains control of the product (point in time)Within 30-90 days of shipmentObservable in transactions without multiple performance obligations



Software licensesWhen software media is delivered to customer or made available for download electronically, and the applicable license period has begun (point-in-time)Within 30-90 days of the beginning of license periodEstablished pricing practices for software licenses bundled with maintenance, which are separately observable in renewal transactions



Extended hardware warrantyRatably over the course of the support contract (over time)At the beginning of the contract periodObservable in renewal transactions



Other related support offeringsAs work is performed (over time) or course is delivered (point in time)Within 30-90 days of deliveryObservable in transactions without multiple performance obligations



Software maintenance revenue



Software maintenanceRatably over the course of the support contract (over time)At the beginning of the contract periodObservable in renewal transactions



11



Significant Judgments



Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price ("SSP") for each distinct performance obligation.
We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including perpetual and term licenses sold with software maintenance.
We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that needs to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.
Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our enterprise agreement program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.
Additionally, whether a renewal option represents a distinct performance obligation could significantly impact the timing of revenue recognized.
Our products are generally sold with a right of return which is accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize.
Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available and only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur.
During the first quarter of 2018, we began to reclassify our allowance for sales returns to 



"other current liabilities" from "accounts receivable, net" due to the adoption of the new revenue standard.
Disaggregation of Revenues



We disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers based on the timing of transfer of goods or services to customers (point-in-time or over time) and geographic region based on the billing location of the customer.
The geographic regions that are tracked are the Americas (United States, Canada and Latin America), EMEIA (Europe, Middle East, India and Africa) and APAC (Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia and China).
Total net sales based on the disaggregation criteria described above are as follows:

Information about Contract Balances



Amounts collected in advance of services being provided are accounted for as deferred revenue.
Nearly all of our deferred revenue balance is related to extended hardware and software maintenance contracts.
Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although payment is typically due within 30 to 90 days of contract inception.
In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component.
The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers, such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with a portion of the revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, or to provide customers with financing, such as multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.
Changes in deferred revenue, current and long-term, during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material.
Amounts recognized as revenue in excess of amounts billed are recorded as unbilled receivables.
Unbilled receivables which are anticipated to be invoiced in the next twelve months are included in "accounts receivable, net" on the consolidated balance sheet.
Based on the nature of our contracts with customers, we do not typically recognize unbilled receivables related to revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, amounts recognized related to unbilled receivables were not material.
Unsatisfied Performance Obligations



Revenue expected to be recognized in any future period related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less, and excluding contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced, was approximately $54.9 million as of September 30, 2018.
Since we typically invoice customers at contract inception, this amount is included in our current and non-current deferred revenue balances.
As of September 30, 2018, we expect to recognize approximately 12% of the revenue related to these unsatisfied performance obligations during the remainder of 2018, 44% during 2019, and 44% thereafter.
Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer



We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year.
We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized.
Capitalized incremental costs related to initial contracts and renewals are amortized over the same period because the commissions paid on both the initial contract and renewals are commensurate with one another.
Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
13



Practical Expedients



As discussed in "Note 1 - Basis of presentation" and elsewhere in "Note 2 - Revenue," we have elected the following practical expedients in accordance with the new revenue standard:



•We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less.
•We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.
•We do not consider the time value of money for contracts with original durations of one year or less.

Note 4 – Fair value measurements 



We define fair value to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market that market participants may use when pricing the asset or liability.
We follow a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
Fair value measurement is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The three values of the fair value hierarchy are the following: 



Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 



Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly 



Level 3 – Inputs that are not based on observable market data 



Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



15



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We value our available-for-sale short-term investments based on pricing from third party pricing vendors, who may use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 inputs) or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs) in determining fair value.
We classify all of our fixed income available-for-sale securities as having Level 2 inputs.
The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of our financial instruments having Level 2 inputs were derived from non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, or pricing models, such as discounted cash flow techniques.
We believe all of these sources reflect the credit risk associated with each of our available-for-sale short-term investments.
Short-term investments available-for-sale consists of debt securities issued by states of the U.S. and political subdivisions of the U.S., corporate debt securities and debt securities issued by U.S. government organizations and agencies.
All of our short-term investments available-for-sale have contractual maturities of less than 60 months.
Derivatives include foreign currency forward contracts.
Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach (Level 2) based on the spot rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.
We consider counterparty credit risk in the valuation of our derivatives.
However, counterparty credit risk did not impact the valuation of our derivatives during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
There were no transfers in or out of Level 1 or Level 2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
As of September 30, 2018, our short-term investments did not include sovereign debt from any country other than the United States.
We did not have any items that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
The carrying value of net accounts receivable, accounts payable, and long-term debt contained in the consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value.
Note 5 – Derivative instruments and hedging activities 



We recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our statement of financial position at fair value.
The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship.
For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, we designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
16



We have operations in approximately 50 countries.
Sales outside of the Americas accounted for approximately 59% and 58% of our net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, and approximately 61% and 60% of our net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
These financial risks are monitored and managed by us as an integral part of our overall risk management program.
We maintain a foreign currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments (foreign currency forward contracts) to help protect our earnings and cash flows from fluctuations caused by the volatility in currency exchange rates.
The vast majority of our foreign sales are denominated in the customers’ local currency.
We purchase foreign currency forward contracts as hedges of forecasted sales that are denominated in foreign currencies and as hedges of foreign currency denominated financial assets or liabilities.
These contracts are entered into to help protect against the risk that the eventual dollar-net-cash inflows resulting from such sales or firm commitments will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
We also purchase foreign currency forward contracts as hedges of forecasted expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies.
These contracts are entered into to help protect against the risk that the eventual dollar-net-cash outflows resulting from foreign currency operating and cost of sales expenses will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
We designate foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted net sales or forecasted expenses.
In addition, we hedge our foreign currency denominated balance sheet exposures using foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments.
None of our derivative instruments contain a credit-risk-related contingent feature.
Cash flow hedges 



To help protect against the reduction in value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from international sales over the next one to three years, we have instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program.
We hedge portions of our forecasted net sales and forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies with forward contracts.
For forward contracts, when the dollar strengthens significantly against the foreign currencies, the change in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows may be offset by the change in the fair value of the forward contracts designated as hedges.
We purchase foreign currency forward contracts for up to 100% of our forecasted exposures in selected currencies (primarily in Euro, Japanese yen, Hungarian forint, British pound, Malaysian ringgit, Korean won and Chinese yuan) and limit the duration of these contracts to 36 months or less.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and reclassified into earnings in the same line item (net sales, operating expenses, or cost of sales) associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings or expenses during the current period and are classified as a component of “net foreign exchange gain (loss).” Hedge effectiveness of foreign currency forwards designated as cash flow hedges are measured by comparing the hedging instrument’s cumulative change in fair value from inception to maturity to the forecasted transaction’s terminal value.
We held forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges with the following notional amounts:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



17



The contracts in the foregoing table had contractual maturities of 27 months or less and 24 months or less at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
At September 30, 2018, we expect to reclassify $5.1 million of gains on derivative instruments from accumulated OCI to net sales during the next twelve months when the hedged international sales occur, $0.2 million of gains on derivative instruments from accumulated OCI to cost of sales during the next twelve months when the cost of sales are incurred and $0.3 million of gains on derivative instruments from accumulated OCI to operating expenses during the next twelve months when the hedged operating expenses occur.
Expected amounts are based on derivative valuations at September 30, 2018.
The gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness were not material for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 and are included as a component of net income under the line item “net foreign exchange gain (loss).”



Other Derivatives 



Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge our foreign denominated net receivable or net payable positions to help protect against the change in value caused by a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.
We typically attempt to hedge up to 90% of our outstanding foreign denominated net receivables or net payables and typically limit the duration of these foreign currency forward contracts to approximately 90 days or less.
The gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedge item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current earnings under the line item “net foreign exchange gain (loss).” As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we held foreign currency forward contracts that were not designated as hedging instruments with a notional amount of $52 million and $63 million, respectively.
The following tables present the fair value of derivative instruments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

Intangible assets at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Software development costs capitalized for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $1.9 million and $10.1 million, respectively, and related amortization expense was $6.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, capitalized software development costs were $13.8 million and $35.8 million, respectively, and related amortization expense was $19.9 million and $16.5 million, respectively.
Capitalized software development costs for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 included costs related to stock based compensation of $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, capitalized software development costs included costs related to stock based compensation of $0.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
The related amounts in the table above are net of fully amortized assets.
Amortization of capitalized software development costs is computed on an individual product basis for those products available for market and is recognized based on the product’s estimated economic life, generally three to six years.
Acquired technology and other intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives, which range from three to eight years.
Patents are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, generally 10 to 17 years.
Total intangible assets amortization expenses were $9.0 million and $8.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $26.4 million and $25.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Note 8 – Goodwill 



The carrying amount of goodwill as of September 30, 2018, was as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
As we have one operating segment comprised of components with similar economic characteristics, we allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach based on the market capitalization of the reporting unit.
Effective for the annual goodwill impairment test for 2018 and for future testing, we will perform the required annual testing as of November 30 of each year rather than on February 28.
In anticipation of this change, we reperformed our annual goodwill impairment test as of November 30, 2017 and determined that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value for the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount and that no impairment existed as of the assessment date.
We do not believe that the change in the date of the annual goodwill impairment test is a material change in the method of applying an accounting principle nor do we expect that it will result in any delay, acceleration or impact to the results of the impairment testing.
We believe this date is preferable because it aligns with the timing of our annual planning process which largely occurs during the fourth quarter.
Retrospective application to prior periods is impracticable as we are unable to objectively determine, without the use of hindsight, the assumptions that would be used in those earlier periods.
No impairment of goodwill was identified during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 or the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts which are more likely than not to be realized.
We had a valuation allowance of $78 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
A majority of the valuation allowance is related to the deferred tax assets of National Instruments Hungary Kft.
(“NI Hungary”).
We had $9.0 million and $10.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, all of which would affect our effective income tax rate if recognized.
We recorded a gross increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $1 million and $1.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as a result of the tax positions taken during these and prior periods.
We recorded a gross decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $3.1 million for each of the three-and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 as a result of closing open tax years and the enactment-date effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
As of September 30, 2018, it is reasonably possible that we will recognize tax benefits in the amount of $3.4 million in the next twelve months due to the closing of open tax years.
As of September 30, 2018, we had approximately $1.2 million accrued for interest related to uncertain tax positions.
The tax years 2009 through 2018 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.

 Our provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of 11% and 12% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 13% and 15% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In addition, our research and development activities in Hungary benefit from a tax law in Hungary that provides for an enhanced deduction for qualified research and development expenses.
The tax position of our Hungarian operations resulted in income tax benefits of $2.6 million and $4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $7.1 million and $11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Earnings from our operations in Malaysia are free of tax under a tax holiday effective January 1, 2013.
This tax holiday expires in 2027.
The income tax benefits of the tax holiday for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were approximately $0.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
The impact of the tax holiday on a per share basis for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was a benefit of $0.01 per share.
The income tax benefits of the tax holiday for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 were approximately $0.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
The impact of the tax holiday on a per share basis for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 was a benefit of $0.01 per share.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017.
We are applying the guidance in SAB 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the Act.
As of September 30, 2018, we had not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Act.
At December 31, 2017, we recognized a provisional amount of $69.9 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.
During the three month period ended September 30, 2018, we recognized a $(1.8) million adjustment to the provisional amounts recorded at December 31, 2017, primarily related to foreign withholding and distribution taxes.
We expect to finalize our calculation during the fourth quarter of 2018.
The FASB staff Q&A, Topic 740, No.
5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the years the tax is incurred as a period expense only.
Given the complexity of the GILTI provisions, we are still evaluating the effects of the GILTI provisions and have not yet determined our accounting policy.

This repurchase program does not have an expiration date.
Note 12 – Segment and geographic information 



We operate as one operating segment.
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is our chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
Our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis.
Since we operate in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.

We sell our products in three geographic regions which consist of Americas; Europe, Middle East, India, and Africa (EMEIA); and Asia-Pacific (APAC).
Our sales to these regions share similar economic characteristics, similar product mix, similar customers, and similar distribution methods.
Revenue from the sale of our products, which are similar in nature, and software maintenance is reflected as total net sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
(See "Note 2 -Revenue" of Notes to consolidated financial statements for total net sales by the major geographic areas in which we operate).
Based on the billing location of the customer, total sales outside the U.S. for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $213 million and $195 million, respectively, and $635 million and $588 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Total property and equipment, net, outside the U.S. was $132 million as of September 30, 2018 and $132 million at December 31, 2017.
Note 13 - Debt



On May 9, 2013, we entered into a Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank (the “Lender”).
The Loan Agreement provided for a $50 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a scheduled maturity date of May 9, 2018 (the “Maturity Date”).
On October 29, 2015, we entered into a First Amendment to Loan Agreement (the “Amendment”) with the Lender, which amended our Loan Agreement to among other things, (i) increase the unsecured revolving line of credit from $50 million to $125 million, (ii) extend the Maturity Date of the line of credit from May 9, 2018 to October 29, 2020, and (iii) provide us with an option to request increases to the line of credit of up to an additional $25 million in the aggregate, subject to consent of the Lender and terms and conditions to be mutually agreed between us and the Lender.
On April 27, 2018, we entered into a Second Amendment to Loan Agreement (the "Second Amendment") which amended the Loan Agreement, as amended by the Amendment to, among other things, (i) reduce the revolving line of credit from $125.0 million to $5.0 million, (ii) reduce the letter of credit sublimit under the line of credit from $10.0 million to $5.0 million and (iii) require us and our subsidiaries to comply with certain of the affirmative and negative covenants under the Loan Agreement only if loans are outstanding under the Loan Agreement or if we have not reimbursed any drawing under a letter of credit issued under the Loan Agreement within five business days following the request of the Lender.
The loans bear interest, at our option, at a base rate determined in accordance with the Loan Agreement, plus a spread of 0.0% to 0.50%, or a LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.13% to 2.00%, in each case with such spread determined based on a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to EBITDA, determined in accordance with the Loan Agreement.
Principal, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, is due and payable on the Maturity Date.
We are also obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee, payable in arrears, based on the available commitments at a rate of 0.18% to 0.30%, with such rate determined based on the ratio described above.
The Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants.
The affirmative covenants include, among other things, delivery of financial statements, compliance certificates and notices; payment of taxes and other obligations; maintenance of existence; maintenance of properties and insurance; and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
The Loan Agreement also requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to EBITDA equal to or less than 3.25 to 1.00, and a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to interest expense greater than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00, in each case determined in accordance with the Loan Agreement.
As of September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants in the Loan Agreement.
The Loan Agreement contains customary events of default including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of covenants or representations and warranties, cross-defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, judgment defaults and change in control events, subject to grace periods in certain instances.
Upon an event of default, the lender may declare all or a portion of the outstanding obligations payable by us to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the Loan Agreement.
Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement at a per annum rate of interest equal to 2.00% above the otherwise applicable interest rate.
Proceeds of loans made under the Loan Agreement may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
We may prepay the loans under the Loan Agreement in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty.
Certain of our existing and future material domestic subsidiaries are required to guaranty our obligations under the Loan Agreement.
As of September 30, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit.
During the three months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we incurred interest expense related to our outstanding borrowings of $0 and $176,000, respectively.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we incurred interest expense related to our outstanding borrowings of $0 and $519,000, respectively.
As of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the weighted-average interest rate on the revolving line of credit was 3.4% and 2.4%, respectively.
These charges are included in “Other income (loss), net” in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Note 14 – Commitments and contingencies 



We offer a one-year limited warranty on most hardware products which is included in the terms of sale of such products.
We also offer optional extended warranties on our hardware products for which the related revenue is recognized ratably over the warranty period.
Provision is made for estimated future warranty costs at the time of the sale for the estimated costs that may be incurred under the standard warranty.
Our estimate is based on historical experience and product sales during the period.
The warranty reserve for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of September 30, 2018, we had non-cancelable purchase commitments with various suppliers of customized inventory and inventory components totaling approximately $7.3 million over the next twelve months.
As of September 30, 2018, we had outstanding guarantees for payment of customs and foreign grants totaling less than $0.1 million, which are generally payable over the next twelve months.

Note 15 – Restructuring



Since the first quarter of 2017, we have been taking steps to optimize our processes, reduce job duplication, evaluate where we should shift and centralize activities, improve efficiencies, and rebalance our resources on higher return activities.
This has led to headcount reductions.
The timing and scope of our headcount reductions will vary.
A summary of the charges in our consolidated statement of operations resulting from our restructuring activities is shown below:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



A summary of balances and activity related to our restructuring activity is shown below:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The restructuring liability of $3.8 million at September 30, 2018 relating to our restructuring activity is recorded in the “accrued compensation” line item of our consolidated balance sheet.

Note 16 – Litigation 



We are not currently a party to any material litigation.
However, in the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, are currently and will likely become involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.
No assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any investigation, litigation or dispute.
Note 17 – Subsequent events 



On October 24, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per common share, payable on December 3, 2018, to stockholders of record on November 12, 2018.

ITEM 1.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



We are not currently a party to any material litigation.
However, in the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past, are currently and will likely become involved in various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.
No assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any investigation, litigation or dispute.
ITEM 1A.
The risks described below are not the only risks that we face.
In March 2018, the U.S. imposed steel, aluminum, and other tariffs on imports from various countries.
These tariffs have increased international trade tensions and led to tariffs on U.S. exports to various countries.
See “Current business outlook” in this Form 10-Q for information regarding recent business conditions.
We plan to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new and existing products and technologies.
For example, in 2017 we launched LabVIEW NXG, the most recent version of our flagship software application.
We have made and expect to make significant investments in software development related to the new and enhanced features of this product.
These investments involve a number of risks as the commercial success of such efforts depend on many factors, including our ability to anticipate and respond to innovation, achieve the desired technological fit, and be effective with our marketing and distribution efforts.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, we have experienced significant delays between the announcement and the commercial availability of new products.
Our Reported Financial Results May be Adversely Affected by Changes in Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the U.S. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers which, as amended, supersedes nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance and which became effective for us for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018.
(See “Note 1 - Basis of presentation” and "Note 2 - Revenue") for additional discussion of the accounting changes).
Our international sales are subject to inherent risks, including, but not limited to:



•fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar;



•unexpected changes to currency policy or currency restrictions in foreign jurisdictions;



•delays in collecting trade receivable balances from customers in developing economies;



•tariffs and other trade barriers; 



•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;



•fluctuations in local economies; 



•disparate and changing employment laws in foreign jurisdictions;



•difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; 



•costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries; 



•government actions throughout the world; and, 



•the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our efforts to increase foreign market penetration.
45



In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
We must also comply with various import and export regulations.
The application of these various regulations depends on the classification of our products which can change over time as such regulations are modified or interpreted.
Additionally, the regulatory environment in some countries is very restrictive as their governments try to protect their local economy and value of their local currency against the U.S. dollar.
Our Manufacturing Capacity, and a Substantial Majority of our Warehousing and Distribution Capacity is Located Outside of the U.S. We manufacture substantially all of our product volume at our facilities in Debrecen, Hungary and Penang, Malaysia.
In addition to being subject to the risks of maintaining such a concentration of manufacturing capacity and global inventory, these facilities and their operations are also subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including, but not limited to:



•the volatility of the Hungarian forint and the Malaysian ringgit relative to the U.S. dollar; 



•changing and potentially unstable political environments; 



•significant and frequent changes in corporate tax laws; 



•difficulty in managing manufacturing operations in foreign countries; 



•challenges in expanding capacity to meet increased demand; 



•difficulty in achieving or maintaining product quality; 



•interruption to transportation flows for delivery of components to us and finished goods to our customers; 



•restrictive labor codes; and, 



•increasing labor costs.
No assurance can be given that our efforts to mitigate these risks will be successful.
Our centralization of inventory and distribution from a limited number of shipping points is subject to inherent risks, including:



•burdens of complying with additional or more complex VAT and customs regulations; and, 



•concentration of inventory increasing the risks associated with fire, natural disasters and logistics disruptions to customer order fulfillment.
Our Financial Performance is Subject to Risks Associated with Changes in the Value of the U.S. Dollar versus Local Currencies.
The vast majority of our sales outside of the U.S. are denominated in local currencies, and accordingly, the U.S. dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates.
If the local currencies in which we sell our products strengthen against the U.S. dollar, we have in the past, and in the future may need to, lower our prices in the local currency to remain competitive in our international markets.
In the past, these dynamics have also adversely affected our net sales growth in international markets and may pose similar challenges in the future.
See “Current business outlook” in this Form 10-Q for information regarding recent business conditions.
We continue to make a concentrated effort to increase our net sales through the pursuit of orders with a value greater than $1.0 million.
These types of orders expose us to significant additional business and legal risks compared to smaller orders.
At times these orders include terms that impose critical delivery commitments and severe contractual liabilities if we fail to provide the required quantity of products at the required delivery times, impose product acceptance requirements and product performance evaluation requirements which create uncertainty with respect to the timing of our ability to recognize revenue from such orders, allow the customers to cancel or delay orders without liability, require us to develop specific product mitigation plans for product delivery constraints caused by unexpected or catastrophic situations to help assure quick production recovery, and that require most favored customer pricing, significant discounts, extended payment terms and volume rebates.
At times these customers require broad indemnity obligations and large direct and consequential damage provisions in the event we breach our contracts with them.
At times these contracts have supply constraint requirements which mandate that we allocate large product inventories for a specific contract.
These inventory requirements expose us to higher risks of inventory obsolescence and can adversely impact our ability to provide adequate product supply to other customers.
In addition, these larger orders are more volatile, are subject to greater discount variability and may contract at a faster pace during an economic downturn.
We attempt to manage these risks but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts.
Sales of our products are dependent on customers in certain industries, particularly the telecommunications, semiconductor, consumer electronics, automotive, energy, automated test equipment, government, defense and aerospace industries.
Recently, we have undertaken internal reorganizations designed to improve operational efficiencies, enhance our ability to pursue market opportunities and accelerate our technology development initiatives.
We are currently reorganizing certain aspects of our sales and marketing operations to orient our coverage around customer accounts.
By virtue of our holdings of cash, investment securities and foreign currency derivatives, we have exposure to many different counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks and investment banks.
Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default of our counterparties.
We continue to monitor the stability of the financial markets, particularly those in the emerging markets.
47



We Have Established a Budget and Variations From Our Budget Will Affect Our Financial Results.
We have an operating budget for 2018.
The markets in which we operate are characterized by intense competition from numerous competitors, some of which are divisions of large corporations having far greater resources than we have, and we may face further competition from new market entrants in the future.
A key competitor is Keysight Technologies Inc. (“Keysight”) which was part of Agilent until November 2014.
Keysight offers hardware and software products that provide solutions that directly compete with our virtual instrumentation products including its own line of PXI based hardware.
Keysight is aggressively advertising and marketing products that are competitive with our products.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.
Our Revenues are Subject to Seasonal Variations.
In previous years, our revenues have been characterized by seasonality, with revenues typically growing from the first quarter to the second quarter, being relatively constant from the second quarter to the third quarter, growing in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter and declining in the first quarter of the following year from the fourth quarter of the preceding year.
There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any future examinations.
In addition, effective January 1, 2010, certain qualified research and development expenses in Hungary became eligible for an enhanced tax deduction.
These tax benefits may not be available in future years due to changes in political conditions in Hungary or changes in tax laws in Hungary or in the U.S.
Profits from our manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia are free of tax under a 15 year tax holiday effective January 1, 2013.
Our manufacturing processes use large volumes of high-quality components and subassemblies supplied by outside sources.
Several of these items are only available through limited sources.
Limited source items purchased include custom ASICs, chassis and other components.
We have in the past experienced delays and quality problems in connection with limited source items, and there can be no assurance that these problems will not recur in the future.
In some countries, we use distributors to support our sales channels.
We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business.
We rely on a primary global center for our management information systems and on multiple systems in branches not covered by our global center.
As with any information system, unforeseen issues may arise that could affect our ability to receive adequate, accurate and timely financial information, which in turn could inhibit effective and timely decisions.
Furthermore, it is possible that our global center for information systems or our branch operations could experience a complete or partial shutdown.
A significant system or network disruption could be the result of new system implementations, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches, facility issues or energy blackouts.
Threats to our information technology security can take a variety of forms and individuals or groups of hackers or sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations, may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our infrastructure.
In addition, changing laws and regulations governing our responsibility to safeguard private data could result in a significant increase in operating or capital expenditures needed to comply with these new laws or regulations.
Accordingly, our operating results in such periods would be adversely impacted.
From time to time, we have experienced attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our information technology systems; however, such attacks have not previously resulted in any material damage to us.
We are continually working to maintain reliable systems to control costs and improve our ability to deliver our products in our markets worldwide.
Our efforts include, but are not limited to the following: firewalls, antivirus protection, patches, log monitors, routine backups with offsite retention of storage media, system audits, data partitioning and routine password modifications.
Our internal information technology systems environment continues to evolve and our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace as new threats emerge.
No assurance can be given that our efforts to continue to enhance our systems will be successful.
We are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Website.
We devote significant resources to maintaining our website, ni.com, as a key marketing, sales and support tool and expect to continue to do so in the future.
We host our website internally.

Our Products are Complex and May Contain Bugs or Errors.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, our software products or third-party operating systems on which our products are based often contain bugs or errors.
Our products operate in conjunction with third-party products and components across a broad ecosystem.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, our products, or products or components in conjunction with which they operate, may contain design flaws.
We Are Subject to the Risk of Product Liability Claims.
Our products are designed to provide information upon which users may rely.
Our products are also used in “real time” applications requiring extremely rapid and continuous processing and constant feedback.
Such applications give rise to the risk that a failure or interruption of the system or application could result in economic damage, bodily harm or property damage.
In past years, we have completed several acquisitions.
Achieving the anticipated benefits of an acquisition depends upon whether the integration of the acquired business, products or technology is accomplished efficiently and effectively.
In addition, successful acquisitions generally require, among other things, integration of product offerings, manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and R&D efforts.
These difficulties can become more challenging due to the need to coordinate geographically separated organizations, the complexities of the technologies being integrated, and the necessities of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures.
The integration of operations following an acquisition also requires the dedication of management resources, which may distract attention from our day-to-day business and may disrupt key R&D, marketing or sales efforts.
Compliance With Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is Costly and Challenging.
As required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, this Form 10-Q contains our management’s certification of adequate disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2018.
Our most recent annual report on Form 10-K also contains a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting including an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.
Our most recent annual report on Form 10-K also contains an attestation and report by our external auditors with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404.
We expect that the ongoing compliance with Sections 302 and 404 will continue to be both very costly and very challenging and there can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not be identified in future periods.

Our Business Depends on the Continued Service of Our Key Management and Technical Personnel.
Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management, sales, marketing, research and development and operational personnel including Alex Davern, Chief Executive Officer, Eric Starkloff, President and Chief Operating Officer, and other members of our senior management and key technical personnel.
In connection with his promotion to Chief Executive Officer in January 2017, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Davern.
We have no other agreements providing for the employment of any of our key employees for any fixed term and our key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time.
We also believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled management, technical, marketing, research and development, and operational personnel with experience in managing large and rapidly changing companies, as well as training, motivating and supervising employees.
The market for hiring and retaining certain technical personnel, including software engineers, has become more competitive and intense in recent years.
Failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel, including software engineers, or retain our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
We must comply with many different governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our operations in the U.S., Hungary, and Malaysia.
Although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations, our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines, suspension of production or a cessation of operations.
Any such environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations.
Any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.
Provisions in Our Charter Documents and Delaware Law May Delay or Prevent an Acquisition of Us.
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors.
These provisions include a classified Board of Directors, prohibition of stockholder action by written consent, prohibition of stockholders to call special meetings and the requirement that the holders of at least 80% of our shares approve any business combination not otherwise approved by two-thirds of our Board of Directors.
Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.
In addition, our Board of Directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer.
