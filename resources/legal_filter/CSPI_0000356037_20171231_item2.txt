Results of Operations



Overview of the three months ended December 31, 2017 



 Our revenues increased by approximately $2.1 million, or 10%, to $22.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $19.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.
The increase in revenue is the result of an increase of $2.4 million in our TS segment, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in our HPP segment.
Our gross margin percentage increased overall, from 22% of revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2016, to 23% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 due in part to an increase in higher margin TS segment service revenues.
Operating income increased by $0.1 million from an operating loss of $102 thousand for the three month period ended December 31, 2016 to operating income of $7 thousand for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a $681 thousand increase in gross profit partially offset by an increase of $572 thousand in higher operating expenses.
Our income tax expense increased by approximately $1.1 million to $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to an income tax benefit of $15 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2016.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 The increase in HPP product revenues is primarily attributed to increased Myricom product shipments partially offset by lower Multicomputer product shipments and parts sales for the period.
The decrease in HPP services revenues is primarily attributed to a $329 thousand decrease in royalties on high-speed processing boards related to the E2D program shipped for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.
TS segment revenue change was as follows for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The net change to other income (expenses) of $149 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, was primarily driven by the net change of approximately $(147) thousand in the foreign exchange gain (loss) on foreign currency holdings in the current period as compared to the prior year period.
Income Taxes



On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R.
1) (the “Tax Act”) was enacted into law.
In accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, the Company is required to recognize the effect of the Tax Act in the period of enactment, which was the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2018 that ended on December 31, 2017.
The many changes in the Tax Act include a permanent reduction in the maximum federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective as of January 1, 2018.
The statutory federal income tax rate applicable for the Company's fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 is expected to be 24.3% based on a fiscal year blended rate calculation.
The Company has made reasonable estimates of the impact of the Tax Act and, in accordance with the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118, has recorded a provisional net income tax expense of approximately $1.1 million for the period ended December 31, 2017.
The Company was required to revalue its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new rate in the Company's first quarter of 2018.
The Company has recorded a provisional estimate for a one-time tax expense of $490 thousand, for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The Company has included a provisional estimate in the amount of $649 thousand related to the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings in the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
As noted, these expenses have been recorded discretely in the quarter ending December 31, 2017.
The provisional amount is based on information currently available, including estimated tax earnings and profits from foreign investments.
The Company continues to gather and analyze information, including historical adjustments to earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, in order to complete the accounting for the effects of the estimated transition tax.
Liquidity and Capital Resources



Our primary source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents, which increased by $4.3 million to $18.2 million as of December 31, 2017 from $13.9 million as of September 30, 2017.
Significant sources of cash for the three months ended December 31, 2017 included a decrease in accounts receivable of $7.4 million, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $2.0 million, a decrease in deferred tax assets of $0.5 million, and an increase in income taxes payable of $0.4 million.
19



Significant uses of cash for the three months ended December 31, 2017 included an increase in other current assets of $1.9 million, an increase in inventories of $1.3 million, an increase in deferred costs of $1.2 million, a net loss of $1.2 million, and a decrease in deferred revenues of $0.7 million.
Cash held by our foreign subsidiaries located in Germany and the United Kingdom totaled approximately $5.8 million as of December 31, 2017 as compared to $4.6 million as of September 30, 2017.
This cash is included in our total cash and cash equivalents reported above.
If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy working capital requirements, we may need to access funds through lines of credit, the equity markets, or other means.
Based on our current plans and business conditions, management believes that the Company’s available cash and cash equivalents, the cash generated from operations and availability on our lines of credit will be sufficient to provide for the Company’s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future.

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 



The Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2017.
Our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team supervised and participated in this evaluation.
The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2017, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to the fact that we are not yet able to conclude that the material weakness described below in this Item 4 has been remediated by the changes we made in response to that material weakness.
As previously disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended September 30, 2017, our management identified a material weakness as of such date.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be able to be prevented or detected in a timely basis.
The identified material weakness is in connection with our controls over the revenue recognition process at our foreign subsidiaries, specifically whether revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied prior to recognizing revenue and the failure to sufficiently assess gross versus net revenue indicators to certain revenue transactions.
We determined that controls over the revenue recognition process were not operating effectively and the resulting control gap amounted to a material weakness in our controls over financial reporting.
During the periods following our initial identification of the material weakness referred to above, management assessed various alternatives to remediate this material weakness and we implemented changes to our system of internal controls, which included the implementation of enhanced internal auditing procedures, whereby revenue transactions are subjected to an additional review process at the corporate level to ensure the correct accounting methodology is applied to all revenue transactions.
During the three months ended December 31, 2017, management continued to take additional actions to upgrade our international accounting staff and improved accounting operations in our European divisions.
Although we have implemented such changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as described above, at this time, we cannot conclude that the material weakness has been remediated and we will continue to make personnel changes and upgrade systems and processes throughout fiscal year 2018.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
During the three months ended December 31, 2017, management implemented process improvements and made certain changes to upgrade its internal accounting staff and improve operations in our European division in connection with the identified material weakness noted above.
