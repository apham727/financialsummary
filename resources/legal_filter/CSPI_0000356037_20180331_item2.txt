Results of Operations



Overview of the three months ended March 31, 2018 



 Our revenues decreased by approximately $3.3 million, or 13%, to $22.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $25.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The decrease in revenue is the result of a decrease of $1.7 million in our TS segment, combined with a $1.6 million decrease in our HPP segment.
Our gross margin percentage was unchanged at 22% of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Operating income decreased by approximately $1.3 million from operating income of $622 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to an operating loss of $723 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily as a result of a $765 thousand decrease in gross profit combined with an increase of $580 thousand in operating expenses.
Our income tax expense decreased by approximately $339 thousand resulting in an income tax benefit of $128 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to an income tax expense of $211 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The decrease to the income tax expense was primarily due to the decrease in operating income.
The following table details our results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of sales for the three months ended:

Revenues



 Our revenues decreased by approximately $3.3 million to $22.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $25.3 million of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
TS segment revenues decreased by $1.7 million, and HPP segment revenues decreased by $1.6 million.
16



HPP segment revenue change was as follows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 The decrease in HPP product revenues of $513 thousand is primarily attributed to decreased Multicomputer product shipments.
The decrease in HPP services revenues is primarily attributed to a $1.1 million decrease in royalties on high-speed processing boards related to the E2D program shipped for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.
TS segment revenue change was as follows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The decrease in TS segment product revenues of $3.0 million during the period was primarily the result of a decrease in product revenues of $1.4 million in our U.K. division, combined with decreases of $1.2 million and $0.4 million in our German and U.S divisions, respectively.
The $1.4 million decrease in the U.K. division product revenues was primarily the result of decreased product shipments to a major customer.
The decrease in TS segment product revenues was partially offset by an increase in TS segment service revenues of $1.3 million during the period.
The increase in TS segment service revenues for the period ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the prior fiscal year three month period was due primarily to an increase of $1.2 million in our U.S. division.
The $1.2 million increase in the U.S. division service revenues was substantially the result of a $900 thousand increase in internal services and additional third party maintenance revenues of $300 thousand.
Our revenues by geographic area, which is based on the customer location to which the products were shipped or services rendered, were as follows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The $2.3 million decrease in revenue to Europe is primarily the result of decreased sales by our TS segment U.K. division of $1.3 million to a U.S. division multi-national customer, combined with decreased sales by our TS segment German division of $1.0 million.
17



Gross Margins



 Our gross margin ("GM") decreased by $0.8 million to $4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to a gross margin of $5.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The GM as a percentage of revenue was 22% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, unchanged from the three months ended March 31, 2017.

The impact of product mix within our TS segment on gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 The overall TS segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 20% for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 from 16% for the three month period ended March 31, 2017.
Operating Expenses

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses



The following table details our selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense by operating segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 SG&A expenses increased by $0.4 million, or 9%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to a rise in the TS segment SG&A expenses attributed to increases in variable compensation in our U.S. division as a result of increased margins, and sales and engineering hires in our U.S. division, which was partially offset by a decrease in HPP segment SG&A expenses resulting substantially from decreased variable compensation costs.
Other Income/Expenses



The following table details our other income (expense) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The net change to other income (expenses) of $16 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily driven by the net change of approximately $37 thousand in the foreign exchange gain (loss) on foreign currency holdings in the current period as compared to the prior year period, partially offset by changes in other income of $18 thousand.
Income Taxes



On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R.
1) (the “Tax Act”) was enacted into law.
In accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, the Company is required to recognize the effect of the Tax Act in the period of enactment, which was the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2018 that ended on December 31, 2017.
The many changes in the Tax Act include a permanent reduction in the maximum federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective as of January 1, 2018.
The statutory federal income tax rate applicable for the Company's fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 is expected to be 24.3% based on a fiscal year blended rate calculation.
Our provision for income tax was a tax benefit of $128 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to a tax expense of $211 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 



The Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2018.
Our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team supervised and participated in this evaluation.
The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2018, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to the fact that we are not yet able to conclude that the material weakness described below in this Item 4 has been remediated by the changes we made in response to that material weakness.
As previously disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended September 30, 2017, our management identified a material weakness as of such date.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be able to be prevented or detected in a timely basis.
The identified material weakness is in connection with our controls over the revenue recognition process at our foreign subsidiaries, specifically whether revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied prior to recognizing revenue and the failure to sufficiently assess gross versus net revenue indicators to certain revenue transactions.
During the periods following our initial identification of the material weakness referred to above, management assessed various alternatives to remediate this material weakness and we implemented changes to our system of internal controls, which included the implementation of enhanced internal auditing procedures, whereby revenue transactions are subjected to an additional review process at the corporate level to ensure the correct accounting methodology is applied to all revenue transactions.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, management continued to take actions to improve accounting operations in our European divisions.
Although we have implemented such changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as described above, at this time, we cannot conclude that the material weakness has been remediated and we will continue to evaluate personnel changes and upgrade systems and processes throughout fiscal year 2018 as necessary.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, management implemented process improvements in order to improve operations in our European division in connection with the identified material weakness noted above.
