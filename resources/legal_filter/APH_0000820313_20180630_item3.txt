 Item 3.
The Company does not have any significant concentration with any one counterparty.
The Company may borrow under its Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Programs.
In addition, any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR, while any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs are subject to floating interest rates.
Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates.
As of June 30, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, while borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs were at an average floating rate of 2.37%.
