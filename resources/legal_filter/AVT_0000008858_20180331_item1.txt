All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2017.
Certain reclassifications have been made in prior periods and the fiscal year to date current periods to conform to the current period presentation.
This update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
The update should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the income tax rate change resulting from the Act is recognized.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2018-02 on its consolidated financial statements.
In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (“SAB 118”), which provides guidance related to the Act.
SAB 118 allows registrants to record provisional amounts during a one year “measurement period”.
The measurement period ends on the earlier of finalization of accounting or one year from the date of the enactment.
During the measurement period, impacts of the Act are expected to be recorded at the time a reasonable estimate for all or a portion of the effects can be made, and provisional amounts can be recognized and adjusted as information becomes available, prepared or analyzed.
SAB 118 summarizes three stages of applying the impact of the Act to be applied at each reporting period, to account for and qualitatively disclose the accounting impacts of the Act: (i) the effects of the Act for which accounting is complete; (ii) provisional amounts (or adjustments to provisional amounts) for the effects of the Act where accounting is not complete, but that a reasonable estimate has been determined; and (3) a reasonable estimate cannot yet be made and therefore taxes are reflected in accordance with law prior to the enactment of the Act.
See Note 8, “Income Taxes” for further discussion of the application of SAB 118 as of March 31, 2018.
Additionally, as a result of the Act, the Company must make an accounting policy election as to whether to record the deferred impacts of the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provision, or to treat it entirely as a period cost.
The Company is still evaluating this GILTI accounting policy election.
In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP.
This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on its consolidated financial

statements.
In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, Compensation–Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”).
The new guidance requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be presented in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, and allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization in assets.
If a separate line item is not used, the line item used in the income statement to present the other components of net benefit cost must be disclosed.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that annual period, with early adoption permitted.
The amendment is to be applied retrospectively.
Refer to Note 9, “Pension Plan,” for further information on the components of net periodic benefit cost.
In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (“ASU 2016-16”).
The update amends accounting guidance for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory to require the recognition of income tax consequences when the transfer occurs.
The update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
A modified retrospective approach should be applied.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-16 on its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”).
The update requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
Early adoption is permitted.
The update will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, using a modified retrospective approach.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended (“ASU 2014-09”), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP.
The core principles of ASU 2014-09 are to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.
Application of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 is expected to require more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process compared to existing GAAP.
ASU 2014-09 is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The Company expects to adopt the requirements of ASU 2014-09 using retrospective adoption to each prior reporting period presented.
The company has established an implementation team inclusive of external advisors engaged to assist in evaluating potential differences compared to existing GAAP.
The Company has identified its revenue streams and is currently assessing each stream for potential impacts from the adoption of ASU 2014-09.
For the revenue streams assessed, the Company does not anticipate a material impact in the timing or amount of revenue recognized.
The Company does not currently expect significant changes in revenue recognition practices for continuing operations compared to existing GAAP.

Acquisitions  



 Dragon Innovation  



 In August 2017, the Company acquired Dragon Innovation, Inc. (“Dragon”), a provider of manufacturing logistics services.
3.
Discontinued operations and gain on sale  



 In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Technology Solutions (“TS”) business to Tech Data Corporation (the “Buyer”).
Included in the gain on sale recorded upon completion of the sale were estimates for certain income taxes due on the gain and additional cash consideration expected from the Buyer related to a closing date net working capital sales price adjustment (the “closing date adjustment”).
The Company is finalizing the closing date adjustment with the Buyer as provided for in the sales agreement and has included an estimate of this amount as primary component of the $305.1 million of prepaid and other current assets as of March 31, 2018.
The final closing date adjustment, as determined through the established process outlined in the sales agreement, may be materially different from the Company’s estimate.
The impact of any changes in estimated income taxes on the gain will be recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale from discontinued operations in the period such change in estimate occurs.
The Company currently expects the closing date adjustment to be finalized by the first half of fiscal 2019 and the income tax on the gain to be finalized by the end of fiscal 2019.
As of March 31, 2018, the Company had 0.9 million shares remaining, which had market value of $75.1 million.
Unrealized and realized gains or losses due to changes in fair value based upon Level 1 quoted active market prices of the Shares are recorded in “Other income (expense), net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The sales agreement includes time based contractual restrictions related to the Company’s sale of the Shares and as such, the Company entered into economic hedges to reduce the Company’s exposure to price fluctuations of the Shares during the restricted period, which fixes the net amount that the Company will realize upon the sale of the Shares.
The Company records changes in fair value related to the economic share price hedges within “Other income (expense), net”, offsetting the changes in fair value of the underlying Shares.
During the nine months ended March 31, 2018, the Company sold 1.9 million Shares, the net proceeds of which have been included in “Cash flows from investing activities – discontinued operations.”  



 In connection with the sale of the TS business, the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”), pursuant to which the Buyer will pay the Company to provide certain information technology, distribution, facilities, finance and human resources related services for various periods of time depending upon the services not to exceed approximately two years from the closing date.
Expenses incurred by the Company to provide such services under the TSA are classified within selling, general and administrative expenses and amounts billed to the Buyer to provide such services are classified as a reduction of such expenses.
As of March 31, 2018, the Buyer has formally terminated substantially all TSA services outside of certain minor information technology services and all remaining TSA services are expected to be terminated by the first half of fiscal 2019.
The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 substantially all relates to settlement losses associated with the Company’s pension plan due to former TS business employees requesting and receiving distributions from the Company’s pension plan during fiscal 2018 and the closing date adjustments discussed above.
Refer to Note 9, “Pension plan,” for further information on the pension settlement losses.

Goodwill and long-lived assets  



 Goodwill  



 The following table presents the change in goodwill by reportable segment for the nine months ended March 31, 2018.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



   (1) Includes accumulated impairment of $1,045,110 from fiscal 2009 



   (2) Includes accumulated impairment of $1,045,110 from fiscal 2009 and $181,440 from fiscal 2018

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)  



 As of December 30, 2017, the $181.4 million of goodwill related to the Electronic Components Americas core reporting unit (the “Americas”) primarily represented goodwill allocated from the acquisitions of Bell Micro, G2 and Round 2, all of which occurred prior to fiscal 2011.
The allocation of goodwill to the Americas represented the expected synergies the Americas would realize from these historical acquisitions.
Once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit, for accounting purposes, the goodwill is no longer directly associated with the underlying acquisitions that the goodwill originated from, but rather the reporting unit to which it has been allocated.
In accordance with ASC 350, the Company has been monitoring the Americas each quarter for the potential need to perform an interim goodwill impairment test.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, in conjunction with the commencement of the Company’s annual long-term planning process, it became apparent that lower cash flows are expected from the Americas over such planning horizon compared to prior year long-term cash flow expectations.
As a result of the lower expected cash flows as well as certain other factors, the Company concluded that an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test for the Americas was necessary in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
In assessing the Americas goodwill for impairment in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company was required to make significant judgments related to the fair value of the Americas.
The Company used a combination of an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow methodology, and a market approach to estimate the fair value of the Americas.
The market approach methodology required significant assumptions related to comparable transactions, market multiples, capital structure and control premiums.
As a result of the impairment testing and related fair value estimate of the Americas in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company impaired all of the goodwill in the Americas and recorded $181.4 million of goodwill impairment expense, which is classified within goodwill impairment expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Intangible Assets  



 The following table presents the Company’s acquired intangible assets at March 31, 2018, and July 1, 2017, respectively.

 Intangible asset amortization expense from continuing operations was $22.6 million and $22.4 million for the third quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $69.9 million and $34.2 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Intangible assets have a weighted average remaining useful life of approximately 3 years.
The following table presents the estimated future amortization expense for the remainder of fiscal 2018, the next five fiscal years and thereafter (in thousands):

 5.
Debt  



 Short-term debt consists of the following (in thousands):  



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 Bank credit facilities and other consists primarily of various committed and uncommitted lines of credit and other forms of bank debt with financial institutions utilized primarily to support the working capital requirements of the Company including its foreign operations.
The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Program”) in the United States with a group of financial institutions to allow the Company to transfer, on an ongoing revolving basis, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable, to provide security or collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of $400 million.
The Program does not qualify for off balance sheet accounting treatment and any borrowings under the Program are recorded as debt in the consolidated balance sheets.
Under the Program, the Company legally sells and isolates certain U.S. trade accounts receivable, into a wholly owned and consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity.
Such receivables, which are recorded within “Receivables” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $774.8 million and $807.5 million at March 31, 2018, and July 1, 2017, respectively.
The Program contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold.
The Program also requires the Company to maintain certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of March 31, 2018, and July 1, 2017.
The Program expires in August 2018 and as a result the Company has classified outstanding balances as short-term debt as of August 2017.
Interest on borrowings is calculated using a base rate or a commercial paper rate plus a spread of 0.40% with a facility fee of 0.40%.

 Long-term debt consists of the following (in thousands):  



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 The Company has a five-year $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of banks, consisting of revolving credit facilities and the issuance of up to $150.0 million of letters of credit, which expires in July 2019.
Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Facility may be increased up to $1.50 billion.
Under the Credit Facility, the Company may select from various interest rate options, currencies and maturities.
The Credit Facility also includes financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of March 31, 2018, and July 1, 2017.
As of March 31, 2018, and July 1, 2017, there were $2.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility.
As of March 31, 2018, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.59 billion and $1.63 billion, respectively.
At July 1, 2017, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.78 billion and $1.85 billion, respectively.
Fair value for the public notes was estimated based upon quoted market prices and for other forms of debt fair value approximates carrying value due to the market based variable nature of the interest rates on those debt facilities.
6.
Derivative financial instruments  



 Many of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies.
This subjects the Company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging (e.g., offsetting receivables and payables in the same foreign currency) as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward foreign exchange contracts typically with maturities of less than 60 days (“economic hedges”), but no longer than one year.
The Company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not economically hedged.
The Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with various financial institutions related to derivative financial instruments allow for the right of offset.
The Company’s policy is to present derivative financial instruments with the same counterparty as either a net asset or liability when the right of offset exists.
The Company’s foreign currency exposure relates primarily to international transactions where the currency collected from customers can be different from the currency used to purchase from suppliers.
The Company’s foreign operations transactions are denominated primarily in the following currencies: U.S. Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, Taiwan Dollar and Mexican Peso.
The amounts recorded to other income (expense), net, related to derivative financial instruments for economic hedges are as follows:  



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 The above table excludes approximately $35.0 million of loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, of derivative financial instrument losses in other income (expenses), net, associated with foreign currency derivative financial instruments purchased to economically hedge the British Pound purchase price of the PF acquisition.
7.
Commitments and contingencies  



 From time to time, the Company may become a party to, or be otherwise involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of conducting its business.
8.
The Act allows the transition tax to be payable over an eight year period without interest.
The Company expects to elect to pay over an eight year period.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company recorded a provisional expense to account for the deferred tax impacts of the Act, which remained unchanged as of March 31, 2018.
The Company’s effective tax rate on its loss before income taxes from continuing operations was (338.0)% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2018 the Company’s effective tax rate on its income before income taxes from continuing operations was 489.2%.

 9.
Pension plan  



 The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan”) that covers substantially all U.S. employees as of January 1, 2018, and an acquired closed noncontributory defined benefit pension plan in the U.S. covering certain PF employees (collectively, the “Plans”).
Components of net period pension cost for the Plans were as follows:  



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



   (1)    Includes discontinued operations 



 The Company contributed $12.0 million to the Plans during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and expects to make an additional contribution to the Plans of $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
The Plans meet the definition of defined benefit plans and as a result, the Company applies ASC 715 pension accounting to the Plans.
The Plans, however, are cash balance plans that are similar in nature to defined contribution plans in that a participant’s benefit is defined in terms of stated account balances.
The cash balance plans provide the Company with the benefit of applying any earnings on the Plans’ investments beyond the fixed return provided to participants, toward the Company’s future cash funding obligations.
Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, to operating expenses during the third quarters and the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were substantially all related to net periodic pension costs including recognition of actuarial losses and amortization of prior service credits.
In connection with the sale of the TS business, a significant number of former employees became terminated vested employees under the Plan.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, the aggregate amount of former employee withdrawals from the Plan exceeded the pension accounting settlement threshold for fiscal 2018, which required a settlement expense under ASC 715 pension accounting.
As a result, the Company recognized a $4.9 million and $18.9 million of pension settlement expenses before taxes in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, classified within income (loss) from discontinued operations.

 Item 1.Legal Proceedings  



 As a result primarily of certain former manufacturing operations, Avnet has incurred and may have future liability under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing pollution and exposure to, and the handling, storage and disposal of, hazardous substances.
Such laws may impose joint and several liability.
Typically, however, the costs for clean up at such sites are allocated among potentially responsible parties based upon each party’s relative contribution to the contamination, and other factors.
Pursuant to SEC regulations, including but not limited to Item 103 of Regulation S-K, the Company regularly assesses the status of and developments in pending environmental and other compliance related legal proceedings to determine whether any such proceedings should be identified specifically in this discussion of legal proceedings, and has concluded that no particular pending legal proceeding requires public disclosure.
Based on the information known to date, management believes that the Company has appropriately accrued in its consolidated financial statements for its share of the estimable costs of environmental and other compliance related matters.
Except as required by law, the Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which the statement is made.
As of March 31, 2018, there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2017.
