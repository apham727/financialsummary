PART II â€“ OTHER INFORMATION



Item 1.Legal Proceedings



We are subject to certain legal proceedings, government audits, investigations, claims and disputes that arise in the ordinary course of our business.
Like most large government defense contractors, our contract costs are audited and reviewed on a continual basis by an in-house staff of auditors from the Defense Contract Audit Agency.
These audits and investigations are conducted to determine if our performance and administration of our government contracts are compliant with contractual requirements and applicable federal statutes and regulations.
An audit or investigation may result in a finding that our performance, systems and administration are compliant or, alternatively, may result in the government initiating proceedings against us or our employees, including administrative proceedings seeking repayment of monies, suspension and/or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government or a particular agency or civil or criminal proceedings seeking penalties and/or fines.
Audits and investigations conducted by the U.S. government frequently span several years.
