Our second quarter 2018 revenues of $21.6 million increased by $0.1 million, or 0.4% compared to revenues of $21.5 million for the same period in 2017. Revenues increased for the Connected Solutions segment by $0.6 million or 3.6%, but these higher revenues were offset when revenues for the RF Solutions segment declined by $0.5 million or 11.3%. For the second quarter 2018, we recorded an operating loss of $1.6 million compared to an operating loss of $0.3 million in the second quarter 2017. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2018 of $43.3 million declined by $1.2 million or 2.6% compared to revenues of $44.5 million for the same period in 2017. Revenues declined in the RF Solutions segment by $2.3 million or 21.9%, but revenues increased in the Connected Solutions segment by $1.1 million or 3.2%. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded an operating loss of $2.8 million compared to an operating loss of $0.3 million during the same period in 2017. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the increase in revenues for the Connected Solutions segment was due to increased sales in the Enterprise Wi-Fi vertical market, while the decrease in revenues for the RF Solutions segment was primarily due to lower capital spending by U.S. carriers and also lower revenues in the Asia Pacific region because 2017 included some large projects in China and Japan. The operating loss for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily the result of the negative gross margin impact of lower revenues generated by the RF Solutions segment and a lower gross margin percentage for the Connected Solutions segment. Operating expenses were lower for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 as lower general and administrative expenses offset higher research and development expenses.

Revenues by Segment 
Revenues increased 0.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and decreased 2.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. Revenues for the Connected Solutions segment increased 3.6% and 3.2% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017 due to increased sales in the Enterprise Wi-Fi vertical market. Revenues for the RF Solutions segment decreased 11.3% and 21.9% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017 primarily due to lower capital spending by U.S. carriers for legacy 4G wireless systems in preparation for the capital expenditures required for 5G deployments. RF Solution revenues were also lower in the Asia Pacific region because 2017 included some large projects in China and Japan.  
Gross Profit by Segment 
The gross profit decreased by 560 basis points for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and decreased by 520 basis points for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017. The declines in gross profit were due to a higher mix of revenues from the Connected Solutions segment as well as a decline in the gross profit percentage for the Connected Solutions segment. The gross profit for the Connected Solutions segment declined by 520 basis points and 360 basis points for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, due to price pressure in the small cell vertical market and due to product mix. The gross profit for the RF Solutions segment decreased by 250 and 310 basis points for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017 primarily due to the impact of fixed costs over lower revenues. 
Consolidated Operating Expenses 
Research and development expenses increased approximately $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and increased $0.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. The increase during the three months ended June 30, 2018 consists of higher expenses of $0.2 million for the Connected Solutions segment and higher expenses of $0.2 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase during the six months ended June 30, 2018 consists of higher expenses of $0.5 million for the Connected Solutions segment and higher expenses of $0.1 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in the prior year. Expenses for both segments were higher compared to the prior year periods due to additional headcount and equipment required to support investments in growth areas.  
Sales and Marketing 
Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and decreased $0.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017. For the three months ended June 30, 2018, sales and marketing expenses were higher by $0.2 million for the RF Solutions segment and approximately even for the Connected Solutions segment compared to the same period in 2017. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, sales and marketing expenses for the Connected Solutions segment declined $0.3 million, offsetting higher sales and marketing expenses of $0.2 million for the RF Solutions segment compared to the same period in 2017. The expense decrease for the Connected Solutions segment is due to headcount reductions in sales and marketing at the end of the first quarter 2017. The expense increase for RF Solutions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was due to additions to sales and marketing headcount. 
General and Administrative 
General and administrative expenses declined by $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and declined by $0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017 because 2017 included incentive compensation expense and corporate expenses related to the CEO transition that were not included in 2018 and other corporate expenses were lower in 2018. Incentive compensation expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, were $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Corporate expenses related to the CEO transition were $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.  
Amortization expense within operating expenses was $0.1 million and $0.2 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Between the first quarter 2017 and the second quarter 2018, there were no changes to intangible assets that impacted amortization expense  
Stock-based compensation expense 
Stock compensation expense was approximately the same for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same periods in 2017.  
Operating (Loss) Income by Segment 
We reported a total operating loss of $1.6 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and an operating loss of $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The operating losses were primarily the result of lower profits for the RF Solutions segment and lower gross profits for the Connected Solutions segment. Due to lower revenues we recorded operating losses of $0.4 million and $0.7 million for RF Solutions segment during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to income for the same periods in 2017. Operating profit for the Connected Solutions segment was lower by approximately $0.8 million during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and lower by $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage. Within the corporate function, expenses were lower by $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 due to lower expenses related to the Short-Term Incentive Plan (“STIP”) and because the same periods in 2017 included expenses related to the CEO transition. 
Other Income, Net 
Other income, net consists of interest income, foreign exchange losses and gains, and interest expense. Interest income increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher average interest rates but also due to higher investment and cash equivalent balances. Our investment and cash equivalent balances declined during the six months ended June 30, 2018 but were higher compared to the first six months of 2017.  
Net Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax Benefit 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we approved a plan to sell our Network Engineering Services business (“Engineering Services”) and shift our focus toward research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products. We sold the business to Gabe’s Construction on July 31, 2017. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to discontinued operations. The results for Engineering Services is reported as discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. The net loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 includes operating losses, net of income tax benefits. The loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 reflects negative gross margin of $0.1 million and $0.2 million due to the impact of high fixed costs over low revenues.  
Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview 
At June 30, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were approximately $36.5 million, and we had working capital of $55.6 million. Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations, with short-term swings in liquidity supported by a significant balance of cash and short-term investments. The balance has fluctuated with cash from operations, acquisitions and divestitures, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common shares. 
Within investing activities, capital spending historically ranges between 2.0% and 4.0% of our revenues and the primary use of capital is for manufacturing and engineering development. Our capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2018 were approximately 3.5% of revenues. We historically have significant transfers between investments and cash as we rotate our large cash balances and short-term investment balances between money market funds, which are accounted for as cash equivalents, and other investment vehicles. We have a history of supplementing our organic revenue with acquisitions of product lines or companies, resulting in significant uses of our cash and short-term investment balances from time to time. We expect the historical trend for capital spending and the variability caused by moving money between cash and investments and periodic merger and acquisition activity to continue in the future. 
Management believes that our current financial position, which includes the $36.5 million in cash and investments and no debt, combined with our historic ability to generate free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital spending) provide adequate liquidity and working capital to support our operations. 
Operating activities generated $2.0 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2018. We generated $1.4 million of cash from our income statement activities and generated $0.6 million of cash from our balance sheet activities. Within the balance sheet activities, we generated cash due to an increase in accounts payable of $2.7 million and net collections of accounts receivable of $0.5 million, offsetting use of cash for net payments of accrued liabilities of $2.1 million and higher inventories of $0.8 million. Accrued liabilities were lower at June 30, 2018, primarily due to the payout of $1.7 million for the 2017 short-term incentive plan. Accounts payable was higher at June 30, 2018 because we extended the payment cycle for certain vendors to match accounts receivable collections and due to the timing of purchases during the second quarter 2018. Inventories were higher for the Connected Solutions segment in both the U.S. and China.  
Operating activities from continuing operations provided $4.4 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2017. We generated $3.2 million of cash from our income statement activities and $1.2 million of cash from our balance sheet activities.

Inventories declined during the six months ended June 30, 2017 for both Connected Solutions and RF Solutions due to process improvements related to purchasing and forecasting, as well as a decrease in revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. Accounts receivable declined during the six months ended June 30, 2017 due to the decrease in revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.
