Our first quarter 2019 revenues of $20.6 million decreased by $1.1 million or 5.3% compared to revenues of $21.7 million for the same period in 2018. Revenues decreased for the antenna product line by $2.7 million or 15.1% and increased for the test and measurement product line by $1.5 million or 38.4% compared to the first quarter 2018. Revenues decreased for the antenna product line due to lower revenues with Enterprise Wi-Fi applications and increased for the test and measurement due to sales of 5G products. The gross profit of $8.7 million, increased by $0.8 million, or 10.1% compared to gross profit of $7.9M for the same period in 2018, due to a higher mix of test and measurement product revenues and due to an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products. Primarily based on higher gross margins, we recorded a lower operating loss for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the first quarter 2018. The operating loss was $0.5 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  
Introduction 
PCTEL antenna are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) providers where the antennas are designed into the customer’s solution. Competition in the antenna markets is fragmented. Competitors include Airgain, Amphenol, Laird, Panorama, and Taoglas.  
Our test and measurement products are sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEM providers who integrate our products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers. Competitors for PCTEL’s test tool products include OEMs such as Anritsu, Berkley Varitronics, Digital Receiver Technology, and Rohde and Schwarz.  
Effective August 2018, we consolidated our organizational structure to drive growth and address the convergence in the Industrial IoT, public safety, and 4G infrastructure markets and the emergence of new technologies such as 5G (the “Reorganization”). Our operations, engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions were consolidated into a single enterprise-wide organization. As a result of the Reorganization, our Chief Executive Officer, as the CODM, began assessing operating profits and identified assets at the enterprise level for resource allocations. In connection with the Reorganization, the Board of Directors appointed a Chief Operating Officer who maintains regular contact with the CODM to discuss  
Until the Reorganization, PCTEL operated in two segments for reporting purposes, Connected Solutions and RF Solutions. Our CODM assessed operating profits and identified assets for the Connected Solutions and RF Solutions segments for resource allocations. Each segment had its own general manager as well as its own engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions.  
Because the Reorganization occurred during the third quarter 2018, this Form 10-Q does not include segment reporting information; however, we have included revenues and gross profit for the two major product lines (antenna products and test and measurement products) because each product line has a significantly different gross profit profile. In order to understand our financial results, it is necessary to understand the impact on gross profit of the revenue mix between them.  
Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 
Revenues by Product Line 
Revenues decreased 5.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the decrease in revenues for the antenna product line was due to lower sales for Enterprise Wi-Fi applications. Revenues for the test and measurement product line increased 38.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to sales of test equipment in connection with early deployments of 5G infrastructure in the U.S., Europe and Asia. 
Gross Profit by Product Line 
The gross profit percentage increased by 5.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 because of a higher ratio of revenues from test and measurement products and because of higher gross profits for antenna products. Higher margin test and measurement products comprised 27% of the revenues in the first quarter 2019 compared to 18% of the revenues in the first quarter 2018. The gross profit percentage for the antenna product line increased by 2.9% due to more favorable product mix and due to cost reductions.  
Consolidated Operating Expenses 
Research and Development 
Research and development expenses increased by approximately $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The increase is primarily due to spending on investments for 5G test and measurement equipment and for wireless products development for Industrial IoT.  
Sales and Marketing 
General and Administrative 
General and administrative expenses increased by $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 as cash-based incentive compensation expense of $0.1 million, equity-based compensation expense of $0.1 million and legal expenses of $0.1 million offset reductions in executive management related to the Reorganization in 2018.  
Amortization expense within operating expenses was $73 and $124 for each of the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. The decrease in amortization expense was due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized during 2018.  
Stock-based compensation expense 
Stock compensation expense was higher by $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to an increase in the expense accrued for our short-term incentive plan (“2019 STIP”). Under the 2019 STIP, certain executive and managers will be paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares of the Company’s stock. 
Operating Loss  
Other Income, Net 
Other income, net consists of interest income, foreign exchange losses, and interest expense. Interest income from short-term investment securities increased during the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher average interest rates.  
Overview 
Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations, with short-term swings in liquidity supported by a significant balance of cash and short-term investments. The balance has fluctuated with cash from operations, acquisitions and divestitures, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common shares. 
Within investing activities, capital spending historically ranges between 2.0% and 4.0% of our revenues and the primary use of capital is for manufacturing, engineering, and product development. Our capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2019 were approximately 1.5% of revenues. We historically have significant transfers between investments and cash as we rotate our large cash balances and short-term investment balances between money market funds, which are accounted for as cash equivalents, and other investment vehicles. We have a history of supplementing our organic revenue with acquisitions of product lines or companies, resulting in significant uses of our cash and short-term investment balances from time to time. We expect the historical trend for capital spending and the variability caused by moving money between cash and investments and periodic merger and acquisition activity to continue in the future. 
At March 31, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were approximately $35.0 million, and we had working capital of $52.4 million. Management believes that our cash and investments provide adequate liquidity and working capital to support our operations given our historic ability to generate free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital spending) and our lack of debt. 
Operating activities generated $1.5 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2019. We generated $1.5 million of cash from our income statement activities and generated nothing from the balance sheet.  
Operating activities used $1.6 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2018. We generated $0.5 million of cash from our income statement activities and used $2.1 million of cash from our balance sheet activities. Within the balance sheet activities, we used cash due to lower accrued liabilities of $1.8 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $0.4 million, offsetting cash generated from a decline of $0.3 million in inventories. Accrued liabilities were lower at March 31, 2018 due to the payout of $1.7 million for the 2017 short-term incentive plan. Accounts receivable were higher despite lower revenues due to longer payment terms granted and a higher percentage of revenues were generated in the third month of the quarter ended March 31, 2018. U.S. inventories declined during the three months ended March 31, 2018 for the antenna product line.  
Our investing activities used $27 of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2019. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, redemptions and maturities of our short-term investments provided $14.2 million in funds and we rotated $13.9 million of cash into new short-term investments. We used $0.3 million for capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2019.  
Our investing activities provided $9.3 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2018. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, redemptions and maturities of our short-term investments provided $17.5 million in funds and we rotated $7.3 million of cash into new short-term investments. We used $0.9 million for capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Capital expenditures included leasehold improvements and equipment for our new office in Akron, Ohio.  
We used $1.4 million in cash for financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2019. We used $1.0 million for cash dividends paid in February 2019. We received $0.3 million in proceeds from the purchase of shares through our ESPP and we used $0.7 million for payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation. The tax payments related to restricted stock awards.
