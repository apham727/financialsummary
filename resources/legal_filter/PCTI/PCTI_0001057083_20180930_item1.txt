For the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 (Unaudited) 
1. Basis of Presentation 
Nature of Operations 
Effective August 2018, the Company consolidated its organizational structure to drive growth and address the convergence in the industrial IoT, public safety, and 4G infrastructure markets and the emergence of new technologies such as 5G. The Company’s operations, engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions were consolidated into single enterprise-wide organizations. As a result of the reorganization that occurred in the third quarter 2018, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) began assessing operating profits and identified assets at the enterprise level for resource allocations, and instead of segment managers, the Chief Operating Officer began reporting to maintaining regular contact with the CODM to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, and plans for the entire business. All operating profit and cash flows are measured and managed at the enterprise level.  
Because the reorganization occurred during the third quarter 2018, this report reflects the segment reporting structure that was in effect for all of 2017 and through August of 2018. Beginning with the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company will not report any segment information. The Company will report revenue and gross profit for its two major product lines, Antenna Products and Test and Measurement Products.  
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company approved a plan to sell its Network Engineering Services business (“Engineering Services”) and shift its focus to research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products. On July 31, 2017, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of the Company’s Engineering Services business to Gabe’s Construction Co., Inc. (“Gabe’s”) for a purchase price of $1.45 million. The Engineering Services business provided design, testing, commissioning, optimization, and consulting services for cellular, Wi-Fi and public safety networks and was a reporting unit within the RF Solutions segment. The disposition of Engineering Services qualified as a discontinued operation for reporting purposes due to the material significance of its historical results and because this disposition represented a strategic shift by the Company to focus on products. As such, the Company reported the results of its Engineering Services business as discontinued operations beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2017. The Company restated the results of Engineering Services as discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. See Note 5 for more information on discontinued operations.

Foreign Operations 
net were $37 and $(45) for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net foreign exchange gains (losses) resulting from foreign currency transactions included in other income, net were $28 and $(98) for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
2. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The Company follows accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures, which establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use  
Cash equivalents are measured at fair value and investments are recognized at amortized cost in the Company’s financial statements. Accounts receivable and other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets. Accounts payable is a financial liability with a carrying value that approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these liabilities. 
3. Earnings per Share 
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents included bank balances and investments with original maturities less than 90 days. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company’s cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid AAA rated money market funds that are required to comply with Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Such funds utilize the amortized cost method of accounting, seek to maintain a constant $1.00 per share price, and are redeemable upon demand. The Company restricts its investments in AAA money market funds to those invested 100% in either short-term U.S. government agency securities or bank repurchase agreements collateralized by these same securities. The fair values of these money market funds are established through quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 inputs). The Company’s cash in U.S. banks is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to the insurable limit of $250.  
The Company had $1.6 million and $1.2 million of cash and cash equivalents in foreign bank accounts at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Included in such amounts are cash of $1.4 million and $1.0 million in China bank accounts at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. As of September 30, 2018, the Company has no intentions of repatriating the cash in its foreign bank accounts in China. If the Company decides to repatriate the cash in the foreign bank accounts, it may experience difficulty in doing so in a timely manner. The Company may also be exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and taxes if it repatriates these funds. The Company is in process of liquidating its Israeli legal entity and will repatriate the cash net of taxes from the foreign bank account in Israel upon liquidation. The Company accounted for the tax impact of the repatriation of the Israel cash in 2017. The Company’s cash in its foreign bank accounts is not insured. 
Investments 
At September 30, 2018, the Company’s short-term investments consisted of U.S. government agency bonds, AA or higher rated corporate bonds, and certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2017, the Company’s short-term investments consisted of pre-funded municipal bonds, U.S. government agency bonds, AA or higher rated corporate bonds, and certificates of deposit. All of the investments at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were classified as held-to-maturity. The bonds have original maturities greater than 90 days and mature in less than one year. The Company’s bond investments are recorded at the purchase price and carried at amortized cost. The income and principal from the pre-refunded municipal bonds were secured by an irrevocable trust of U.S. Treasury securities. Approximately 8% of the Company’s municipal bond investments were protected by bond default insurance at December 31, 2017. All of the municipal bonds matured during the quarter ended June 30, 2018. 
The Company categorizes its financial instruments within a fair value hierarchy according to accounting guidance for fair value. The fair value hierarchy is described under the Fair Value of Financial Instruments in Note 2. For the Level 2 investments, the Company uses quoted prices of similar assets in active markets. The fair values in the table above reflect net unrealized losses of $23 and $34 at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company approved a plan to sell its Engineering Services business and shift its focus to research and development driven RF products. On July 31, 2017, the Company sold its Engineering Services business to Gabe’s. The Company filed a Form 8-K related to the disposition on August 4, 2017.  
The disposition met the requirements for classification as held for sale during the quarter ended June 30, 2017 because the disposition met all the criteria outlined in the accounting guidance. Due to the significance of the results during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, and because this disposition represented a strategic shift by the Company to focus on products, the disposition of Engineering Services also qualified as a discontinued operation for reporting purposes. As such, the Company reported the results of its Engineering Services business as discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017. There were no activities related to discontinued operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 other than transition services related to the billing for one customer. The Company completed the transition for billing as of June 30, 2018.  
The Company sold the fixed assets and backlog of the Engineering Services business to Gabe’s for $1.45 million. At closing, the Company received $1.4 million, consisting of $1.3 million for the sale of the business and $0.1 million related to future services. The Company recorded a pre-tax book gain of $0.5 million in discontinued operations during the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The net pre-tax book gain included proceeds from the sale of assets minus the book value of the assets disposed as well as severance and related payroll benefits for terminated employees. The book value of the assets was $0.6 million at the date of closing. On August 1, 2017, the Company terminated 25 employees, and Gabe’s hired 11 of these employees. The severance and related benefits for the terminated employees who were not subsequently hired by Gabe’s was $0.2 million. The income tax gain was $0.3 million, which included the tax value of the fixed assets and the remaining tax value for intangible assets no longer being used by the Company as of the sale to Gabe’s. The Company retained working capital of approximately $0.5 million, including accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. There was no impairment loss recorded on the disposal of the long-lived assets because the fair value of the assets less cost to sell was higher than the carrying value of the assets.  
There were no changes to goodwill during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018. The $3.3 million of goodwill on the balance sheet relates to the RF Solutions segment. There were no triggering events for the RF Solutions segment during the quarter ended September 30, 2018. The Company will continue to monitor goodwill for impairment going forward.  
Due to the Company’s reorganization in the third quarter 2018, its operations, engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions were consolidated into a single enterprise-wide organizations. Since there are no longer reportable segments, the Company will not disclose segment information starting with the Form-10K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Beginning with the fourth quarter 2018, the Company will evaluate the goodwill based on the cash flows for the Test and Measurement product line. The revenues and gross margins will be specifically identified, and the operating expenses will be a combination of direct expenses and allocated expenses. The cash flows for Test and Measurement product line will only be prepared for testing goodwill and will not be reviewed by the Company’s CODM.  
Intangible Assets 
The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite lives on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, which range from one to six years. Amortization expense was approximately $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. Amortization for technology assets is included in cost of revenues and amortization for all other intangible assets is included in operating expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, $0.1 million of the intangible asset amortization was included in operating expenses and $0.2 million of the amortization expense was included in cost of revenues. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, $0.3 million of the intangible asset amortization was included in operating expenses and $0.5 million of the amortization expense was included in cost of revenues.  
7. Balance Sheet Information 
Accounts Receivable 
Accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts with standard net terms that range between 30 and 90 days. The Company extends credit to its customers based on an evaluation of a customer’s financial condition and collateral is generally not required. The Company maintains an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable. The allowance is based on the Company’s assessment of known delinquent accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence of the collectability and the aging of accounts receivable. The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.3 million at September 30, 2018 and at December 31, 2017.  
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include material, labor and overhead costs using the first-in, first-out method of costing. Inventories as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were composed of raw materials, sub-assemblies, finished goods and work-in-process. The Company had consigned inventory with customers of $0.7 million and $0.5 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The Company records allowances to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market, including allowances for excess and obsolete inventory. Reserves for excess inventory are calculated based on our estimate of inventory in excess of normal and planned usage. Obsolete reserves are based on our identification of inventory where the carrying value is above net realizable value. The allowance for inventory losses was $3.1 million at September 30, 2018 and $3.0 million at December 31, 2017. 
Prepaid and Other Current Assets 
Prepaid assets are stated at cost and are amortized over the useful lives (up to one year) of the assets. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company depreciates computer equipment over three to five years, office equipment, manufacturing and test equipment, and motor vehicles over five years, furniture and fixtures over seven years, and buildings over 30 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the corresponding lease term or useful life. Depreciation expense and gains and losses on the disposal of property and equipment are included in cost of sales and operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. 
Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $2.1 million and $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Amortization for capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense. See Note 10 for information related to capital leases.

The condensed consolidated statements of operations include $2.6 million and $2.5 million of stock compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.  
Restricted Stock – Service Based 
The intrinsic value of service-based restricted shares that vested during the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $36 and $1.3 million, respectively. The intrinsic value of service-based restricted shares that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and 2017 was $0.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively.   
At September 30, 2018, total unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock was approximately $3.4 million to be recognized through 2021 over a weighted average period of 1.4 years. 
Restricted Stock Units – Service Based 
The Company grants restricted stock units as employee incentives. Restricted stock units are primarily granted to foreign employees for long-term incentive purposes. Employee restricted stock units are service-based awards and are amortized over the vesting period. At the vesting date, these units are converted to shares of common stock. The Company records expense on a straight-line basis for restricted stock units. 
The intrinsic value of service-based restricted stock units that vested and were issued as shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 was $29 and $40, respectively.  No service-based restricted stock units vested during the three months ended September 30, 2018 or 2017.  
As of September 30, 2018, the unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of the Company’s restricted stock units was approximately $0.1 million, to be recognized through 2021 over a weighted average period of 1.2 years. 
Stock Options 
The Company grants stock options to purchase common stock as long-term incentives. The exercise price of the stock options is no less than the fair value of the Company’s stock on the grant date. The stock options have a seven-year life and generally vest over a period of four years, 25% after one year, and ratably on a monthly basis thereafter. Stock options may be exercised at any time prior  
to their expiration date or within ninety days of termination of employment, or such shorter time as may be provided in the related stock option agreement.  
The intrinsic value is based on the share price of $4.65 at September 30, 2018. 
The fair value of each stock option outstanding was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Because the Company’s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different  
The dividend yield rate was calculated by dividing the Company’s annual dividend by the closing price on the grant date. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yields with a remaining term that approximates the expected life of the options granted. The expected volatility was based on a five-year historical period of the Company’s stock price. The expected life for options granted was based on historical data of employee exercise performance. The Company records expense based on the graded vesting method. 
Performance-based Equity Awards 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) 
The ESPP enables eligible employees to purchase common stock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or last day of each offering period. Each offering period is approximately six months. The Company received proceeds of $0.4 million from the issuance of 68,212 shares under the ESPP in February 2018 and received proceeds of $0.3 million from the issuance of 72,218 shares under the ESPP in February 2017. The Company received proceeds of $0.3 million from the issuance of 88,583 shares under the ESPP in August 2018 and received proceeds of $0.3 million from the issuance of 67,383 shares under the ESPP in August 2017. 
Based on the 15% discount and the fair value of the option feature of the ESPP, it is considered compensatory. Compensation expense is calculated using the fair value of the employees’ purchase rights under the Black-Scholes model. 
The dividend yield rate was calculated by dividing the Company’s annual dividend by the closing price on the grant date. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yields with a remaining term that approximates the expected life of the options granted. The volatility was based on a five-year historical period of the Company’s stock price. The expected life was based on the offering period. 
The Company grants shares of the Company’s stock under the PCTEL, Inc. Stock Plan to members of its Board of Directors as an annual retainer for committee service. These awards vest upon issuance. New directors receive a one-time grant that vests over three years. In June, 2018, the Company issued 60,988 shares of the Company’s stock with a fair value of $0.4 million. In June, 2017, the Company issued 52,786 shares of the Company’s stock with a fair value of $0.4 million.  
Employee Withholding Taxes on Stock Awards 
For ease in administering the issuance of stock awards, the Company holds back shares of vested restricted stock awards and short-term incentive plan stock awards for the value of the statutory withholding taxes. For each individual receiving a share award, the Company redeems the shares it computes as the value for the withholding tax and remits this amount to the appropriate tax authority. For withholding taxes related to stock awards, the Company paid $0.3 million and $1.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The Company signed a sublease for the office space in the second quarter 2017. In July 2017, the Engineering Services business was sold to Gabe’s Construction. The activity related to Engineering Services is reported as discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. The obligation for the Colorado lease was retained by the Company. See Note 5 for additional information related to discontinued operations.

The Company had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of $8.7 million and $7.7  million at September 30, 2018 and at December 31, 2017, respectively, virtually all of which are related to the United States tax jurisdiction. The Company’s gross deferred tax assets consist of NOLs and credits as well as timing differences. The Company’s NOLs and credits generated as of December 31, 2017 have a finite life primarily based on the 20-year carry forward of federal net operating losses. The timing differences have a ratable reversal pattern over 12 years.  
The Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefit was $0.7 million at September 30, 2018 and at December 31, 2017.  
12. Segment, Customer and Geographic Information 
In August 2018, the Company announced a reorganization of its organizational structure to drive growth and address the convergence in the industrial IoT, public safety, and 4G infrastructure markets and the emergence of new technologies such as 5G. The Company’s operations, engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions were consolidated into a single enterprise-wide organization. Changes in the organizational structure that were initiated in the third quarter 2018 resulted in the CODM assessing operating profits and identified assets at the enterprise level for resource allocations. All operating profit and cash flows are measured and managed at the total Company level.  
Because the reorganization occurred during the third quarter 2018, this report has been prepared under the segment reporting structure that was in effect for all of 2017 and through August 2018. Beginning with the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company will not report any segment information. The Company will report revenue and gross profit for its two major product lines, Antenna Products and Test and Measurement Products.   
The following table represents the customers that accounted for 10% or more of revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. 
The following table represents the customer that accounted for 10% or more of total trade accounts receivable at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.  
13. Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
Under Topic 606, a contract with a customer is an agreement which both parties have approved, that creates enforceable rights and obligations, has commercial substance, and has identified payment terms, and for which collectability is probable. Once the Company has entered into a contract, it is evaluated to identify performance obligations. For each performance obligation, revenue is recognized as control of promised goods or services transfers to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized takes into account variable consideration, such as returns and volume rebates. A majority of the Company’s revenue is short cycle in nature with shipments within one year from order. The Company's payment terms generally range between 30 to 90 days. 
All of the Company’s revenue relates to contracts with customers. The Company’s accounting contracts are from purchase orders or purchase orders combined with purchase agreements. The majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized on a “point-in-time” basis and a nominal amount of revenue is recognized “over time”. For the sale of antenna products and test and measurement products, the Company satisfies its performance obligations generally at the time of shipment, or upon delivery based on the contractual terms with its customers. For products shipped on consignment, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery from the consignment location. For its test and measurement software tools, the Company has a performance obligation to provide software maintenance and support for one year. The Company recognizes revenues for the maintenance and support over this period.  
The Company allows its major distributors and certain other customers to return unused product under specified terms and conditions. The Company estimates product returns based on historical sales and return trends and records a corresponding refund liability. The refund liability was $0.2 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and is included within accrued liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The December 31, 2017 refund liability was reclassified from accounts receivable to accrued liabilities for consistency with the current year presentation. Additionally, the Company recorded an asset based on historical experience for the amount of product we expect to return to inventory as a result of the return, which is recorded in inventories in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The product return asset was $0.1 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 
There were no contract assets at September 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017. The Company records contract liabilities for deferred revenue and customer prepayments. Contract liabilities are recorded in accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The contract liability was $0.2 million and $0.3 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The Company recognized revenue of $0.1 million and $0.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, related to contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.
