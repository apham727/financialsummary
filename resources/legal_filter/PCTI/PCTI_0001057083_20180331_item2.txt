Our first quarter 2018 revenues decreased by $1.2 million, or 5.4% compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to lower revenues for the RF Solutions segment. We recorded an operating loss of $1.2 million compared to operating income of $22 during the same period in 2017. The operating loss was primarily the result of the negative gross margin impact of lower revenues with the RF Solutions segment and a lower gross margin percentage for the Connected Solutions segment. Operating expenses were lower for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 as lower sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses offset higher research and development expenses.

Revenues for the Connected Solutions segment increased 2.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to increased sales in the enterprise Wi-Fi vertical market. Revenues for the RF Solutions segment decreased 30.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2017 due to lower capital spending by U.S. carriers and lower revenues in the Asia Pacific region.

The gross profit percentage for the Connected Solutions segment decreased 2.0% during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to price pressure in the small cell vertical market and due to product mix.

Consolidated Operating Expenses 
Research and development expenses increased approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The increase during the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily consists of higher expenses for the Connected Solutions segment compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by lower expenses for the RF Solutions segment. Expenses for the Connected Solutions segment were $0.3 million higher for the first quarter 2018 compared to the prior year period due to additional headcount and equipment required to support investments in growth areas.  
Sales and Marketing 
Sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to lower expenses in the Connected Solutions segment, partially offset by higher expenses for the RF Solutions segment.

General and Administrative 
General and administrative expenses decreased $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease is due to a decline in incentive compensation expense of $0.2 million and because the first quarter of 2017 included $0.1 million in corporate expenses related to the CEO transition. 
Amortization expense within operating expenses was $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Between the first quarter 2017 and the first quarter 2018, there were no changes to intangible assets that impacted amortization expense

Operating (Loss) Income by Segment 
We reported a total operating loss of $1.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to operating income of $22 for the same period in 2017.

Within the corporate function, expenses were $0.3 million lower in the three months ended March 31, 2018 due to lower expenses related to the STIP and because the first quarter 2017 included expenses related to the CEO transition. 
Other Income, Net 
Other income, net consists of interest income, foreign exchange losses, and interest expense. Interest income increased during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year due to higher average interest rates and due to higher investment and cash equivalent balances.

Net Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax Benefit 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we approved a plan to sell our Network Engineering Services business (“Engineering Services”) and shift our focus toward research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products.

The results for Engineering Services is reported as discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 includes operating losses, net of income tax benefits. The loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 reflects negative gross margin of $0.1 million due to the impact of high fixed costs over low revenues.  
At March 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and investments were approximately $34.7 million, and we had working capital of $57.2 million.

The balance has fluctuated with cash from operations, acquisitions and divestitures, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common shares. 
Management believes that our current financial position, which includes $34.7 million in cash and investments and no debt, combined with our historic ability to generate free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital spending) provide adequate liquidity and working capital to support our operations.
