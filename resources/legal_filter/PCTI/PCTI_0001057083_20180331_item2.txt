Our first quarter 2018 revenues decreased by $1.2 million, or 5.4% compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to lower revenues for the RF Solutions segment. We recorded an operating loss of $1.2 million compared to operating income of $22 during the same period in 2017. The operating loss was primarily the result of the negative gross margin impact of lower revenues with the RF Solutions segment and a lower gross margin percentage for the Connected Solutions segment. Operating expenses were lower for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 as lower sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses offset higher research and development expenses.  
PCTEL delivers Performance Critical TELecom technology solutions to the wireless industry. We are a leading global supplier of wireless network antenna and testing solutions. The Connected Solutions segment designs and manufactures precision antennas. PCTEL antennas are deployed in small cells, enterprise Wi-Fi access points, fleet management and transit systems, and in network equipment and devices for the Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”). The RF Solutions segment provides test tools that improve the performance of wireless networks globally. Mobile operators, neutral hosts, and equipment manufacturers rely on PCTEL to analyze, design, and optimize next generation wireless networks. 
PCTEL operates in two segments for reporting purposes. Each segment has its own segment manager as well as its own engineering, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions. All of our accounting and finance, human resources, IT and legal functions are provided on a centralized basis through the corporate function. 
Revenue growth for the RF Solutions segment is driven by the implementation and roll out of new wireless technology standards (i.e., 3G to 4G, 4G to 5G, etc.). PCTEL test equipment is sold directly to wireless carriers or to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) who integrate our products into their solution, which is then sold to wireless carriers. PCTEL maintains expertise in several technology areas in order to be competitive in the test tool market. These include radio frequency engineering, digital signal processing (“DSP”) engineering, manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering. 
Revenues decreased 5.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Revenues for the Connected Solutions segment increased 2.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to increased sales in the enterprise Wi-Fi vertical market. Revenues for the RF Solutions segment decreased 30.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2017 due to lower capital spending by U.S. carriers and lower revenues in the Asia Pacific region.  
The gross profit percentage of 36.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 5.0% lower than the same period in 2017. The gross profit percentage for the Connected Solutions segment decreased 2.0% during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to price pressure in the small cell vertical market and due to product mix. The gross profit percentage for RF Solutions segment decreased 3.5% compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to the impact of fixed costs over lower revenues. 
Research and development expenses increased approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The increase during the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily consists of higher expenses for the Connected Solutions segment compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by lower expenses for the RF Solutions segment. Expenses for the Connected Solutions segment were $0.3 million higher for the first quarter 2018 compared to the prior year period due to additional headcount and equipment required to support investments in growth areas.  
Sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to lower expenses in the Connected Solutions segment, partially offset by higher expenses for the RF Solutions segment. Sales and marketing expenses for the Connected Solutions segment declined $0.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to headcount reductions in sales and marketing at the end of the first quarter 2017.  
General and administrative expenses decreased $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease is due to a decline in incentive compensation expense of $0.2 million and because the first quarter of 2017 included $0.1 million in corporate expenses related to the CEO transition. 
Amortization expense within operating expenses was $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Between the first quarter 2017 and the first quarter 2018, there were no changes to intangible assets that impacted amortization expense  
We reported a total operating loss of $1.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to operating income of $22 for the same period in 2017. The operating loss was primarily a result of lower profits for the RF Solutions segment. We recorded an operating loss of $0.3 million for RF Solutions segment during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to income of $1.0 million for the same period in 2017 due to lower revenues. Operating profit for the Connected Solutions segment was lower by approximately $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage. Within the corporate function, expenses were $0.3 million lower in the three months ended March 31, 2018 due to lower expenses related to the STIP and because the first quarter 2017 included expenses related to the CEO transition. 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we approved a plan to sell our Network Engineering Services business (“Engineering Services”) and shift our focus toward research and development driven radio frequency (“RF”) products. We sold the business to Gabe’s Construction on July 31, 2017. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to discontinued operations. The results for Engineering Services is reported as discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 includes operating losses, net of income tax benefits. The loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 reflects negative gross margin of $0.1 million due to the impact of high fixed costs over low revenues.  
At March 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and investments were approximately $34.7 million, and we had working capital of $57.2 million. Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations, with short-term swings in liquidity supported by a significant balance of cash and short-term investments. The balance has fluctuated with cash from operations, acquisitions and divestitures, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common shares. 
Within investing activities, capital spending historically ranges between 2.0% and 4.0% of our revenues and the primary use of capital is for manufacturing and development of engineering requirements. Our capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2018 were approximately 4.0% of revenues. We historically have significant transfers between investments and cash as we rotate our large cash balances and short-term investment balances between money market funds, which are accounted for as cash equivalents, and other investment vehicles. We have a history of supplementing our organic revenue with acquisitions of product lines or companies, resulting in significant uses of our cash and short-term investment balances from time to time. We expect the historical trend for capital spending and the variability caused by moving money between cash and investments and periodic merger and acquisition activity to continue in the future. 
Management believes that our current financial position, which includes $34.7 million in cash and investments and no debt, combined with our historic ability to generate free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital spending) provide adequate liquidity and working capital to support our operations. 
Operating activities provided $2.0 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2017.

Inventories declined during the three months ended March 31, 2017 for both the Connected Solutions and RF Solutions segments due to process improvements related to purchasing and forecasting as well as a sequential decrease in revenues. Accounts receivable declined during the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to the sequential decrease in revenues. Revenues declined by $0.7 million during for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to three months ended December 31, 2016.
