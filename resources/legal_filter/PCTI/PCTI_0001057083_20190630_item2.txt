Overview 
Our second quarter 2019 revenues were $23.5 million and increased by $1.9 million or 8.9% compared to revenues of $21.6 million for the same period in 2018. Second quarter 2019 revenues increased by $3.4 million or 82.0% to $7.5 million for the test and measurement product line compared to the second quarter 2018 and decreased by $1.5 million or 8.4% to $16.0 million for the antenna product line. Revenues decreased for the antenna product line due to lower revenues with enterprise Wi-Fi applications and small cell antennas. Revenues increased for the test and measurement product line due to increased sales of 5G products. The gross profit of $10.7 million, increased by $2.9 million compared to the same period in 2018 due to both a higher product mix of test and measurement product line revenues and an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products. Primarily based on higher gross profit margins, we recorded an operating income of $0.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to an operating loss of $1.6 million during the second quarter 2018.  
Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were $44.1 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 1.8% compared to the same period in 2018. Revenues increased for the test and measurement product line by $4.9 million or 60.6% compared to the same period in 2018 and decreased for the antenna product line during the six months ended June 30, 2019 by $4.1 million or 11.7% due to lower revenues with enterprise Wi-Fi applications and small cell antennas. Revenues increased for the test and measurement product line due to sales of 5G products. The gross profit of $19.4 million increased by $3.7 million compared to gross profit for the same period in 2018, due to a higher product mix of test and measurement product revenues and due to an increase in the gross margin percentage for antenna products. Because of higher gross profit margins, we recorded an operating income of $0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to an operating loss of $2.8 million for the same period in 2018. 
Description of Business 
PCTEL antenna are primarily sold to original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) providers where the antennas are designed into the customer’s solution. Competition in the antenna markets is fragmented. Competitors include Airgain, Amphenol, Laird, Panorama, and Taoglas.  
Our test and measurement products are sold directly to wireless carriers or to OEM providers who integrate our products into their solutions which are then sold to wireless carriers. Competitors for PCTEL’s test tool products include OEMs such as Anritsu, Berkley Varitronics, Digital Receiver Technology, and Rohde and Schwarz.  
Effective August 2018, we consolidated our organizational structure to drive growth and address the convergence in the Industrial IoT, public safety, and 4G infrastructure markets and the emergence of new technologies such as 5G (the “Reorganization”). Our operations, engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions were consolidated into a single enterprise-wide organization. As a result of the Reorganization, our Chief Executive Officer, as the CODM, began assessing operating profits and identified assets at the enterprise level for resource allocations. In connection with the Reorganization, the Board of Directors appointed a Chief Operating Officer who maintains regular contact with the CODM to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, and plans for our businesses. All operating profit and cash flows are measured and managed at the enterprise level.  
Until the Reorganization, PCTEL operated in two segments for reporting purposes, Connected Solutions and RF Solutions. Our CODM assessed operating profits and identified assets for the Connected Solutions and RF Solutions segments for resource allocations. Each segment had its own general manager as well as its own engineering, business development, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions.  
Tianjin Transition Plan 
On August 7, 2019 the Board of Directors approved a transition plan for our China manufacturing operations. In order to optimize the cost structure of the antenna product line and increase our competitiveness, we will transition high-volume manufacturing from our Tianjin facility to contract manufacturers in China and elsewhere. We expect the transition to be substantially completed by the end of our 2020 fiscal year (the “Transition Period”) and we expect to recognize cumulative pre-tax charges of approximately $1.0 million consisting of severance and other transition costs. It is expected that a total of approximately 140 positions, or approximately 35% of the Company’s full-time global workforce, will be eliminated over the course of the Transition Period. Approximately $0.9 million of severance costs will be paid in cash. Other non-cash costs associated with the transition to contract manufacturers include fixed asset dispositions estimated to be $0.1 million. We anticipate that these charges will be recognized as restructuring expenses during the third and fourth quarters of 2019. We expect the cash payments for employee separation costs to be made during the second half of 2019 and the first half of 2020. 
Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 
Revenues by Product Line 
Revenues increased 8.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 and 1.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2019. For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2019, the decrease in revenues for the antenna product line of 8.4% and 11.7%, compared to the same periods in 2018, was due to lower sales for small cell antennas and for enterprise Wi-Fi applications. Revenues for the test and measurement product line increased 82.0% and 60.6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due to sales of test equipment in connection with early deployments of 5G infrastructure in the U.S., Europe and Asia. 
Gross Profit by Product Line 
The gross profit percentage increased by 9.4% and 7.7% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 because of a higher ratio of revenues from test and measurement products and because of higher gross profits for antenna products. Higher margin test and measurement products comprised 32.0% of the revenues in the second quarter 2019 compared to 19.2% of the revenues in the same period in 2018 and comprised 29.6% of the revenues in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 18.8% for the same period in 2018. The gross profit percentage for the antenna product line increased by 6.0% and 4.5% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due to more favorable product mix and due to cost reductions.  
Consolidated Operating Expenses 
Research and development expenses were approximately the same for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018. Spending on investments for 5G test and measurement equipment and for wireless products development for Industrial IoT offset the impact of cost reductions from 2018.  
Sales and Marketing 
Sales and marketing expenses were approximately the same for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 and decreased $0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, higher corporate marketing expenses offset lower expenses for sales headcount in North America.  
General and Administrative 
General and administrative expenses increased by $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 as cash-based incentive compensation expense increased $0.4 million, equity-based compensation expense increased $0.3 million and other corporate expenses increased by $0.1 million. General and administrative expenses increased by $1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 as cash-based incentive compensation expense increased by $0.6 million, equity-based compensation expense increased by $0.4 million and corporate expenses increased by $0.3 million, offsetting $0.2 million in reductions in executive management related to the Reorganization in 2018.  
Amortization expense within operating expenses was lower by approximately $0.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 because certain intangible assets became fully amortized during 2018 and the first quarter 2019.  
Stock-based compensation expense 
Stock compensation expense was higher by $0.3 million and $0.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to expense accrued for our short-term incentive plan (“2019 STIP”). Under the 2019 STIP, certain executive and managers will be paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares of the Company’s stock. The incentive awards for all other participants under the 2019 STIP will be 100% in cash. 
Other Income, Net 
Other income, net consists of interest income, foreign exchange losses, and interest expense. Interest income from short-term investment securities increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to higher average interest rates.  
Net Income (Loss) 
For the three months ended June 30, 2019 we recorded net income of $0.9 million compared to a net loss of $1.2 million for the same period in 2018, and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 we recorded net income of $0.6 million compared to a net loss of $2.1 million for the same period in 2018. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 higher gross margins as well as other income offset higher operating expenses Gross margins increased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to same periods in 2018 because of a higher mix of test and measurement product revenues and due to an improvement in the gross margin percentage for antenna products.  
Overview 
Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations, with short-term swings in liquidity supported by a significant balance of cash and short-term investments. The balance has fluctuated with cash from operations, acquisitions and divestitures, payment of dividends and the repurchase of our common shares. 
At June 30, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were approximately $36.8 million, and we had working capital of $54.2 million. Management believes that our cash and investments provide adequate liquidity and working capital to support our operations given our historic ability to generate free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital spending) and our lack of debt. 
Operating activities generated $5.1 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2019. We generated $4.9 million of cash from our income statement activities and generated $0.2 million from the balance sheet. The balance sheet generated net cash primarily because an increase in accrued liabilities offset other net uses of cash. Accrued liabilities increased by $0.7 million primarily due to higher bonus accruals. A reduction in prepaid expenses provided $0.4 million in cash flow primarily with amortization of annual software license agreements. Inventories increased by $0.3 million driven by test and measurement products for 5G technologies. Accounts receivable increased by $0.2 million due to an increase in revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.  
Operating activities generated $2.0 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2018. We generated $1.4 million of cash from our income statement activities and generated $0.6 million of cash from our balance sheet activities. Within the balance sheet activities, we generated cash due to an increase in accounts payable of $2.7 million and net collections of accounts receivable of $0.5 million, offsetting use of cash for net payments of accrued liabilities of $2.1 million and higher inventories of $0.8 million. Accrued liabilities were lower at June 30, 2018, primarily due to the payout of $1.7 million for the 2017 short-term incentive plan. Accounts payable was higher at June 30, 2018 because we extended the payment cycle for certain vendors to match accounts receivable collections and due to the timing of purchases during the second quarter of 2018. Inventories were higher for the antenna product line in both the U.S. and China.  
Our investing activities used $2.8 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2019. During the six months ended June 30, 2019, redemptions and maturities of our short-term investments provided $25.0 million in funds and we rotated $26.8 million of cash into new short-term investments. We used $1.0 million for capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2019.  
Our investing activities provided $2.1 million of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2018. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, redemptions and maturities of our short-term investments provided $26.3 million in funds and we rotated $22.7 million of cash into new short-term investments. We used $1.5 million for capital expenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2018. Capital expenditures included equipment for our new development office in Akron, Ohio. 
We used $2.5 million in cash for financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2019. We used $2.0 million for quarterly cash dividends paid in February 2019 and May 2019. We received $0.3 million in proceeds from the purchase of shares through our ESPP and we used $0.7 million for payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation. The tax payments related to restricted stock awards.
