 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  
 Our fiscal quarter ends on the Saturday nearest the end of the quarter-ending month. The third quarter of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 both contained 13 weeks. The first nine months of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 contained 40 and 39 weeks, respectively.  
 The financial information contained in this report should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2017, that we filed on July 31, 2017.  
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09 (“ASU 2014-09”), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is principles based guidance that can be applied to all contracts with customers, enhancing comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. The core principle of the guidance is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The guidance details the steps entities should apply to achieve the core principle. In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date for all entities by one year. For public entities, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Companies have the option of using either a full or modified retrospective approach in applying this standard. During fiscal 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued four additional updates which further clarify the guidance provided in ASU 2014-09.  
During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment using the first day of our fourth quarter as the measurement date. If after reviewing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then we test for impairment through the application of a fair value based test. We estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results, market approach, and discounted cash flows. 
 Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives either on a straight-line basis or over their projected future cash flows and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment.  
The carrying value of goodwill was $6.3 million as of March 3, 2018 and May 27, 2017. 
 (1) Change from prior periods reflect impact of foreign currency translation.  
 As of March 3, 2018, we had approximately $0.2 million invested in time deposits and certificates of deposit (“CD”) which mature in less than twelve months. The fair value of these investments is equal to the face value of each time deposit and CD.  
 As of May 27, 2017, we had invested in time deposits and certificates of deposit in the amount of $8.2 million. Of this, $6.4 million mature in less than twelve months and $1.8 million mature in greater than twelve months. The fair value of these investments is the face value of each time deposit and CD.  
 We liquidated our investments in equity securities in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Proceeds from the liquidation were $0.9 million with gross realized gains of $0.2 million for the nine months ended March 3, 2018. Prior to the liquidation of our investment in equity securities, our investments in equity securities were classified as available-for-sale and were carried at their fair value based on quoted market prices. Our investments, which were included in non-current assets, had a carrying amount of $0.6 million as of May 27, 2017. Proceeds from the sale of securities were $0.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Prior to liquidating the equity securities, we reinvested proceeds from the sale of securities, and the cost of the equity securities sold was based on a specific identification method. Gross realized gains on those sales were less than $0.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Net unrealized holding gains of less than $0.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  
We offer warranties for the limited number of specific products we manufacture. We also provide extended warranties for some products we sell that lengthen the period of coverage specified in the manufacturer’s original warranty. Our warranty terms generally range from one to three years. 
 Warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty. Warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence. Warranty reserves were approximately $0.1 million as of March 3, 2018 and May 27, 2017.  
 In December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 that allows for a measurement period up to one year after the enactment date of the Act to complete the accounting requirements. The Company will complete the adjustments related to the Act within the allowed period.  
 On September 12, 2017, the Company received an income tax refund from the State of Illinois of approximately $2.0 million, which was inclusive of interest earned. The refund was a result of the conclusion of the Illinois amended return related to the sale of the RF, Wireless and Power Division in 2011. A net benefit of $1.5 million, which includes $0.5 million of professional fee costs incurred to pursue the refund, was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 in discontinued operations.  
 We have authorized 17,000,000 shares of common stock, and 3,000,000 shares of Class B common stock. The Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and has transferability restrictions; however, Class B common stock may be converted into common stock on a share-for-share basis at any time. With respect to dividends and distributions, shares of common stock and Class B common stock rank equally and have the same rights, except that Class B common stock cash dividends are limited to 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.

 On December 5, 2017, Steven H. Busch filed a Verified Stockholder Derivative Complaint against Edward J. Richardson, Paul Plante, Jacques Belin, James Benham, Kenneth Halverson, and the Company in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Steven H. Busch v. Edward J. Richardson, et al., C.A. No. 2017-0868-AGB. The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty by the Company’s directors and challenges the decision of a special committee of the Company’s Board to refuse Mr. Busch’s demand that the Company’s Board, among other things, rescind the Company’s May 2013 repurchase of stock from Mr. Richardson and May 2013 and October 2014 repurchases of Company stock from the Richardson Wildlife Foundation. The Company believes the lawsuit to be without merit and that a loss is not probable or estimable based on the information available at the time the financial statements were issued.  
 ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  
 As of March 3, 2018 and May 27, 2017, we held investments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our investments currently consist of time deposits and CDs, where face value is equal to fair value, and as of May 27, 2017, equity securities of publicly traded companies for which market prices are readily available.  
 On June 15, 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement for the IMES facility with LDL, LLC. The Executive Vice President of IMES, Lee A. McIntyre III (former owner of IMES), has an ownership interest in LDL, LLC. The lease agreement provides for monthly payments over five years with total future minimum lease payments of $0.3 million. Rental expense related to this lease amounted to $0.1 million for the nine months ended March 3, 2018 and for the nine months ended February 25, 2017. The Company shall be entitled to extend the term of the lease for a period of an additional five years by notifying the landlord in writing of its intention to do so within nine months of the expiration of the initial term.

 Net Sales and Gross Profit Analysis  
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2018 consolidated net sales increased 28.9% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Sales for PMT increased 28.7%, sales for Canvys increased 57.2% and sales for Healthcare decreased 19.6%. The increase in PMT was due to specialty products engineered and manufactured in LaFox which are sold to the semiconductor capital market and new technology partners in power conversion and RF and microwave components. The increase for Canvys was due to increased customer demand in both our North American and European markets. The decrease in Richardson Healthcare was primarily due to the sale of the PACS display business at the end of fiscal 2017, partially offset by higher sales of equipment and certified and refurbished CT tubes.

 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses  
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $13.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from $12.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was due to higher compensation and other expenses mostly related to the increase in net sales as well as higher research and development costs and other incremental expenses for Richardson Healthcare. Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased to 31.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from 37.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.  
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $38.0 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 from $37.7 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2017. The increase was due to higher compensation and other expenses mostly related to the increase in net sales as well as higher research and development costs and other incremental expenses to support our growth strategies in Richardson Healthcare. The increase was partially offset by a charge of $1.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 for severance expense related to a reduction in workforce.  
 In December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 that allows for a measurement period up to one year after the enactment date of the Act to complete the accounting requirements. The Company will complete the adjustments related to the Act within the allowed period.  
 On September 12, 2017, the Company received an income tax refund from the State of Illinois of approximately $2.0 million, which was inclusive of interest earned. The refund was a result of the conclusion of the Illinois amended return related to the sale of the RF, Wireless and Power Division in 2011. A net benefit of $1.5 million, which includes $0.5 million of professional fee costs incurred to pursue the refund, was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 in discontinued operations.  
 We believe that the existing sources of liquidity, including current cash, will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs through the next twelve months.   
 The cash used in operating activities primarily resulted from adjustments for non-cash items and changes in our operating assets and liabilities.   
 Operating activities used $0.3 million of cash during the first nine months of fiscal 2018. We had net income of $2.1 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million associated with the issuance of stock option and restricted stock awards and depreciation and amortization expense of $2.2 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, net of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, included an increase in inventories of $5.2 million, a decrease of $0.4 million in accounts payable and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of $1.3 million. The inventory increase was due to the ongoing growth of our RF and power technologies business, increase in raw material and work in process supporting the semiconductor capital equipment market and growth in supplying replacement systems and parts to the Healthcare market. The decrease in our accounts payable was due to timing of payments for some of our larger vendors for both inventory and services.  
 Operating activities used $3.2 million of cash during the first nine months of fiscal 2017. We had net loss of $6.8 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2017, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million associated with the issuance of stock option awards, deferred income tax credit adjustment of $0.2 million, and depreciation and amortization expense of $2.0 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the first nine months of fiscal 2017, net of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, included an increase of $1.0 million in prepaid expenses, a decrease of $2.4 million in accounts payable and a decrease in other accrued liabilities of $0.3 million, partially offset by decreases in receivables of $3.2 million and inventories of $1.9 million. The decrease in receivables of $3.2 million was primarily due to the collection of a large receivable during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 that was invoiced during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The inventory decrease was due to decreases in selected electron tubes. The decrease in our accounts payable was due to timing of payments for some of our larger vendors and also the result of shorter payment terms for our Richardson Healthcare vendors.  
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities  
 The cash flow from investing activities has consisted primarily of purchases and maturities of investments and capital expenditures.  
 Cash provided by investing activities of $4.9 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 included proceeds from the maturities of investments of $12.1 million, partially offset by $3.9 million from purchases of investments and $4.2 million in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures relates primarily to our Healthcare growth initiatives, a new roof for part of our warehouse and capital used for our IT system.  
 Cash used by investing activities of $2.6 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2017, included proceeds from the maturities of investments of $3.6 million, offset by $2.1 million from purchases of investments and $4.1 million in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures relates primarily to our Healthcare growth initiative and capital used for our new IT system.  
 Cash used in financing activities of $2.2 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2017 resulted from cash used to pay dividends.  
 Dividend payments for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 were approximately $2.3 million. All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions, and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.    
 Risk Management and Market Sensitive Financial Instruments  
  (a)   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
 Management of the Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of March 3, 2018.  
 Disclosure controls and procedures are intended to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.  
  (b)   Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    
 There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  
 On December 5, 2017, Steven H. Busch filed a Verified Stockholder Derivative Complaint against Edward J. Richardson, Paul Plante, Jacques Belin, James Benham, Kenneth Halverson, and the Company in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Steven H. Busch v. Edward J. Richardson, et al., C.A. No. 2017-0868-AGB. The lawsuit alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty by the Company’s directors and challenges the decision of a special committee of the Company’s Board to refuse Mr. Busch’s demand that the Company’s Board, among other things, rescind the Company’s May 2013 repurchase of stock from Mr. Richardson and May 2013 and October 2014 repurchases of Company stock from the Richardson Wildlife Foundation. The Company believes the lawsuit to be without merit and that a loss is not probable or estimable based on the information available at the time the financial statements were issued.  
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 27, 2017, filed July 31, 2017.
