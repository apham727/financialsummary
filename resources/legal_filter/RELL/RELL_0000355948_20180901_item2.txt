Net Sales and Gross Profit Analysis 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, consolidated net sales increased 19.4% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Sales for PMT increased 19.4%, sales for Canvys increased 24.4% and sales for Healthcare increased 5.2%. The increase in PMT was due to market share gains in the RF and Microwave tube business as well as major growth in our new technology partners in power conversion and RF and Microwave components. The increase for Canvys was due to increased customer demand in both our North American and European markets. The increase in Richardson Healthcare was due to increased Equipment and CT tube sales, partially offset by lower part sales.  
Consolidated gross profit increased to $14.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to $12.1 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Consolidated gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 31.6% during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, from 32.8% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily due to unfavorable product mix for PMT, unfavorable product mix and manufacturing variances for Richardson Healthcare, partially offset by favorable product mix and lower costs on selected products for Canvys. 
Power and Microwave Technologies Group 
PMT net sales increased 19.4% to $34.8 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, from $29.1 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase was due to market share gains in RF and Microwave tube business as well as major growth in our new technology partners in power conversion and RF and Microwave components. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 31.7% during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to 32.9% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, due to unfavorable product mix.  
Canvys net sales increased 24.4% to $7.2 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, from $5.8 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to increased customer demand in both our North American and European markets.

Healthcare 
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $13.1 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from $12.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase was due to higher compensation and other expenses mostly related to the increase in net sales. Operating expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 29.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from 33.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. 
Net Income (Loss) and Per Share Data

We believe that the existing sources of liquidity, including current cash, will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs through the next twelve months.  
Operating activities used $3.6 million of cash during the first three months of fiscal 2019. We had net income of $0.4 million during the first three months of fiscal 2019, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.2 million associated with the issuance of stock option and restricted stock awards, $0.2 million for inventory reserve provisions and depreciation and amortization expense of $0.8 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in a use of cash of $5.3 million during the first three months of fiscal 2019, net of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, included a decrease of $5.4 million in accounts payable and an increase in accounts receivable of $0.2 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of $0.2 million. The decrease in our accounts payable was due to timing of payments for some of our larger vendors for both inventory and services. 
Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
The cash flow used in investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of investments and capital expenditures. 
Cash used in financing activities of $0.6 million during the first three months of fiscal 2019 resulted from $0.8 million of cash used to pay dividends partially offset by $0.2 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises. 
All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.
