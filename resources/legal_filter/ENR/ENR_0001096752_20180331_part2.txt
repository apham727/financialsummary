Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
•actual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service standards to customers;
•the failure to preserve adequate internal controls as we restructure our general and administrative functions, including our information technology and financial reporting infrastructure;
•the failure to preserve supplier relationships and distribution, sales and other important relationships and to resolve conflicts that may arise;
•diversion of management attention from ongoing business activities; and
•the failure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees while implementing benefit changes and reductions in the workforce.
In fiscal 2018, we launched Project Fuel, an enterprise-wide transformational initiative that is designed to address all aspects of our business and cost structure. The project will incorporate our Zero Based Spending and global productivity initiatives, and will include a new global restructuring initiative. The anticipated savings will provide ongoing financial and operational flexibility for reinvestment to reinforce growth and margin improvement objectives. Project Fuel follows on several years of productivity initiatives, as well as the initiatives launched with the overall Separation program. The achievement of our savings targets depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize savings opportunities. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected.
