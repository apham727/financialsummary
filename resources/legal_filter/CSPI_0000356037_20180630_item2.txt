Results of Continuing Operations



Overview of the three months ended June 30, 2018 



 Our revenues decreased by approximately $6.4 million, or 24%, to $20.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $26.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
The decrease in revenue is the result of a decrease of $6.2 million in our TS segment, combined with a $0.2 million decrease in our HPP segment.
Our gross margin percentage increased to 26% of revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2018 from 23% for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Operating income decreased by approximately $1.1 million from operating income of $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 to operating income of $222 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily as a result of a $939 thousand decrease in gross profit combined with an increase of $181 thousand in operating expenses.
The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of higher compensation costs with an increase in the number of engineers and outside consultants for the development of the new Aria security products in the HPP segment.
Our income tax expense decreased by approximately $144 thousand to $249 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to an income tax expense of $393 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
The decrease to the income tax expense was primarily due to the decrease in operating income.

The decrease in HPP services revenues of $258 thousand is primarily attributed to a $382 thousand decrease in royalties on high-speed processing boards related to the E2D program shipped for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017.
TS segment revenue change was as follows for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The $7.2 million decrease in the U.S. division was primarily the result of product sales to a major customer in the prior year 



19



that were not repeated in the current year.
The $0.2 million increase in the U.K. division product revenues was primarily the result of increased product shipments to two customers.
The decrease in TS segment product revenues was partially offset by an increase in TS segment service revenues of $0.9 million during the period.
The increase in TS segment service revenues for the period ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the prior fiscal year three month period was due primarily to an increase of $0.9 million in our U.S. division.

The increased engineering and development expenses for the three month period ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three month period ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributed to an increase in engineering headcount related expenses combined with increased consulting costs.

Results of Discontinued Operations



The following table is a summary of the operating results of the Germany division of our TS segment which have been reflected as discontinued operations.
See Note 12 for additional information.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Liquidity and Capital Resources



Our primary source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents, which was unchanged at $10.4 million as of June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017.
Significant sources of cash for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 included a decrease in accounts receivable of $3.9 million, an increase of $1.1 million from our discontinued operations, and an increase in deferred revenues of $0.8 million.
Significant uses of cash for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 included an increase in inventories of $4.1 million, a net loss of $1.8 million, and dividends paid of $1.3 million.
Cash held by our foreign subsidiary in the United Kingdom totaled approximately $1.2 million as of June 30, 2018 as compared to $1.1 million as of September 30, 2017.
This cash is included in our total cash and cash equivalents reported above.
On July 31, 2018, CSPi announced the completion of the Company's sale of all of the stock of Modcomp GmbH, to Reply AG, an affiliate of Reply SpA, pursuant to the terms of a Share Purchase and Assignment Agreement dated June 27, 2018, and received approximately €12,343,000 in cash (see Note 13).
If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy working capital requirements, we may need to access funds through lines of credit, the equity markets, or other means.
Based on our current plans, business conditions and cash received from the sale of our German operations (see Note 13), management believes that the Company’s available cash and cash equivalents, the cash generated from operations and availability on our lines of credit will be sufficient to provide for the Company’s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Item 4.
Controls and Procedures



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 



The Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2018.
Our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team supervised and participated in this evaluation.
The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment 



27



in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
As previously disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended September 30, 2017, our management identified a material weakness as of such date.
The identified material weakness is in connection with our controls over the revenue recognition process at our foreign subsidiaries, specifically whether revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied prior to recognizing revenue and the failure to sufficiently assess gross versus net revenue indicators to certain revenue transactions.
During the periods following our initial identification of the material weakness referred to above, management assessed various alternatives to remediate this material weakness and we implemented changes to our system of internal controls, which included the implementation of enhanced internal auditing procedures, whereby revenue transactions are subjected to an additional review process at the corporate level to ensure the correct accounting methodology is applied to all revenue transactions.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, management continued to take actions to improve accounting operations in our European divisions and also announced a transaction to sell our Germany subsidiary.
Although we have implemented such changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as described above, at this time, we cannot conclude that the material weakness has been remediated and we will continue to evaluate personnel changes and upgrade systems and processes throughout fiscal year 2018 as necessary.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, management implemented process improvements in order to improve operations in our European division in connection with the identified material weakness noted above.
