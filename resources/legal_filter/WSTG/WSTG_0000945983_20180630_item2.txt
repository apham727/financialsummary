 Financial Overview  
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
 On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation.  
 Revenue  
 The Company adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with customers using the full retrospective method effective January 1, 2018. See Note 5 to the accompanying financial statements for further information. The Company makes estimates regarding performance obligations inherent in the products and services it sells including, whether ongoing maintenance obligations performed by third party vendors are distinct from the related software licenses, and allocation of sales prices among distinct performance obligations. These estimates require significant judgement to determine whether the software’s functionality is dependent on ongoing maintenance or if substantially all functionality is available in the original software download. We also use judgement in the allocation of sales proceeds among performance obligations, utilizing observable data such as stand-alone selling prices, or market pricing for similar products and services.  
 Allowance for Accounts Receivable  
 The Company’s accounts receivable long-term are discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates at the time of sale based on prevailing rates. In doing so, the Company considers competitive market rates and other factors. At times the Company sells receivables to a financial institution on a non-recourse basis. The net proceeds from such sales are included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows as changes in accounts receivable.  
 Inventory Allowances  
 The Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.  
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease guidance under FASB ASC Topic 840, Leases, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating leases with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of earnings. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.   
 In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ("ASU No. 2016-13"). ASU No. 2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements, particularly its recognition for accounts receivable.   
 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (“ASU 2016-15”) which reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  
consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The ASU is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted in fiscal 2018 with modified retrospective application. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, “Scope of Modification Accounting”, to reduce diversity in practice and provide clarity regarding existing guidance in ASC 718, “Stock Compensation”. The amendments in this updated guidance clarify that an entity should apply modification accounting in response to a change in the terms and conditions of an entity’s share-based payment awards unless three newly specified criteria are met. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The new guidance was effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2018 and did not impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as it is not the Company’s practice to change either the terms or conditions of stock-based payment awards once they are granted.  
 In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. The amendments in this update also make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current U.S. GAAP. ASU No. 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years; the ASU allows for early adoption in any interim period after issuance of the update. The Company is currently assessing the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
 Results of Operations  
 We define adjusted gross billings as net sales in accordance with U.S. GAAP, adjusted for the cost of sales related to Software – security and highly interdependent with support and Maintenance, support and other services. We provided a reconciliation of Adjusted gross billings to net sales, which is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. We use Adjusted gross billings of product and services as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into the volume of business generated by our business, and to analyze the changes to our accounts receivable and accounts payable. Our use of Adjusted gross billings of product and services as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider it in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate Adjusted gross billings of product and services or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.  
 We use Net income excluding separation payments as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into comparison of our businesses profitability when compared to the prior year. Our use of Net income excluding separation expenses, net of tax has limitations, and you should not consider it in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate separation expenses net of tax, or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.  
 Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2017  
 Net Sales  
 Net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 increased 13%, or $4.9 million, to $43.9 million, compared to $39.0 million for the same period in 2017. Adjusted gross billings for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 increased 13%, or $13.6 million, to $116.6 million, compared to $103.0 million for the same period in 2017.   
 TechXtend segment net sales increased $2.0 million or 52% to $5.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, compared to $3.7 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to several larger enterprise sales during the current period compared to the second quarter of 2017. Sales in our TechXtend segment may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of IT spending decisions by our larger customers and internal capital allocation decisions regarding capital we allocate to the extended payment program. Adjusted gross billings for the TechXtend segment increased $7.3 million or 100% to $14.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018.   
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we relied on two key customers for a total of 34.5% of our net sales. One major customer accounted for 18.4% and the other for 16.1%, of our total net sales during the three months ended June 30, 2018. These same customers accounted for 32.3% and 8.4%, of total net accounts receivable as of June 30, 2018.  
 Gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 decreased slightly to $6.5 million, compared to $6.6 million for the same period in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit decreased 6% or $0.3 million to $5.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 compared $5.6 million for the same period in 2017 due to lower vendor rebates and the impact of our lower gross margin as a percentage of net sales (discussed below). Vendor rebates decreased due to the termination of one of our distribution agreements by a vendor that paid a rebate based on sales. TechXtend segment gross profit increased 27% to $1.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 compared to $1.0 million for the same period in the prior year due to the increased net sales from the large enterprise sales discussed above.   
 Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 was 14.8% compared to 16.8% in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin was 13.8% for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, compared to 15.9% in 2017. TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 was 21.9%, compared to 26.1% in 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily caused by the change in the percentage mix of our products which are recorded net of the related cost of sales. During the three months ended June 30, 2018 approximately 8.7 percent of our net sales was attributable to security, maintenance and third-party service products which are recorded on a net basis, or an effective 100% gross profit margin, compared to 10.5% in 2017. This shift in product mix had the effect of reducing gross profit as a percent of net sales by 170 basis points. The remainder of the decline was caused by lower gross profit margin on Software and hardware products recorded on a gross basis, as growth in these products was primarily from high volume lines which are sold at lower gross profit margin than our average gross profit. We operate in a competitive environment where the trend has been and may continue to be for gross profit margins as a percentage of adjusted gross billings to decline.   
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  
 Separation Expense  
 Separation expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 was $2.4 million compared to no expense in the same period in 2017. The increase is due to $2.4 million in separation expenses related to the resignation of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on May 11, 2018, consisting of a $1.7 million charge for accelerated vesting of restricted stock and $0.8 million in accrued payments to be made over the next twelve months.   
 For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.1 million, compared to $0.6 million for the same period in 2017. The company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was impacted by limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation resulting from section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and adjustments to the accrual for state income taxes in states which have enacted economic nexus statutes. The Company recorded a $0.4 million tax benefit related to separation expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2018 which were accounted for as a discrete item, resulting in a 18% effective tax benefit rate on that expense. We also adjusted our provision for state income taxes in states with economic nexus statutes by $0.2. The effective tax rate for ordinary income was 24.1% for the three months ending June 30, 2018, compared to 32.0% during the same period in the prior year.

or $25.9 million, to $241.7 million, compared to $215.8 million for the same period in 2017. Adjusted gross billings increased at a higher rate than net sales primarily due to a higher percentage of sales being comprised of maintenance and Software-security and highly interdependent with support which are recorded on a net basis.   
 TechXtend segment net sales increased $1.4 million or 17% to $9.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $7.9 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to several high dollar enterprise sale transactions during the period ended June 30, 2018. Sales in our TechXtend segment may vary significantly from period to period based on the timing of IT spending decisions by our larger customers and internal capital allocation decisions regarding funds allocated to our extended payment program. Adjusted gross billings for the TechXtend segment increased $5.0 million or 32% to $20.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Adjusted gross billings increased at a higher rate than net sales because of a higher percentage of our sales being derived from maintenance, service and subscriptions which are recorded on a net basis.  
 During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we relied on two key customers for a total of 43.2% of our gross billings. One major customer accounted for 22.0% and the other for 17.1%, of our total net sales during the six months ended June 30, 2018. These same customers accounted for 32.3% and 8.4%, of total net accounts receivable as of June 30, 2018.  
 Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased 1% or $0.1 million, to $13.4 million, compared to $13.3 million for the same period in 2017. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit was unchanged at $11.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 as the impact of decreased gross profit margins offset increases in net sales. TechXtend segment gross profit increased 3% or $0.1 million to $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in the prior year, due to the higher sales discussed above.  
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  
 Separation Expense  
 Separation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $2.4 million compared to no expense in the same period in 2017. The increase is due to $2.4 million in separation expenses related to the resignation of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on May 11, 2018, consisting of a $1.7 million charge for accelerated vesting of restricted stock and $0.8 million in accrued payments to be made over the next twelve months.  
 For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the we recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.6 million or 55.0% of income, compared to $1.2 million or 32.0% of income for the same period in 2017. The company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was impacted by limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation resulting from section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and adjustments to the accrual for state income taxes in states which have enacted economic nexus statutes. We recorded a $0.4 million tax benefit related to separation expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2018 which were accounted for as a discrete item, resulting in a 18% effective tax benefit rate on those expenses. We also recorded an adjustment to our accrual for state income taxes in states with economic nexus statutes of $0.2 million. The effective tax rate for ordinary income was 24.1% for the six months ending June 30, 2018.  
 Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $4.9 million to $10.4 million at June 30, 2018 from $5.5 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in cash was primarily the result of $7.8 million in cash provided by operating activities offset by $2.5 million of cash used for stock repurchases and dividends.   
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $7.8 million, comprised of net income adjusted for non-cash items of $3.2 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4.6 million.   
 The increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in net working capital (accounts receivable, inventory, and vendor prepayments less accounts payable) resulting from the utilization of vendor prepayments made in the prior year and reduced long term accounts receivable.  
 In the six months ended June 30, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million, compared to $0.3 million in the prior year.
