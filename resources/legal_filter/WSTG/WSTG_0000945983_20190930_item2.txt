 Overview  
 The Company is organized into two reportable operating segments. The “Lifeboat Distribution” segment distributes technical software and hardware to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide. The “TechXtend” segment is a value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for corporations, government organizations and academic institutions in the USA and Canada.  
 Dividend Policy and Share Repurchase Program. Historically we have sought to return value to investors through the payment of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Total dividends paid and shares repurchased were $0.8 million and less than $0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, and $0.8 million and less than 
 We adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers on a retrospective basis effective January 1, 2018. Under ASC 606 net sales for certain maintenance, service and security products we sell are recorded net of the related cost of sales. We refer to these items as being recorded on a “net basis” in the discussion below. Software and hardware products for which sales and cost of sales are reported on separate line items are referred to as being recorded on a gross basis.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
 Revenue  
 Allowance for Accounts Receivable  
 In limited circumstances, the Company offers extended payment terms to customers for periods of 12 to 48 months. The related customer receivables are classified as accounts receivable long-term and discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates at the time of sale. In subsequent periods, the accounts receivable is increased to the amounts due and payable by the customers through the accretion of interest income on the unpaid accounts receivable due in future years. The amounts under these long-term accounts receivable due within one year are reclassified to the current portion of accounts receivable. At times the Company sells receivables to a financial institution on a non-recourse basis for cash, less a discount. The net proceeds from such sales are included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows as changes in accounts receivable.  
 Inventory Allowances  
 Interest, Net  
 Interest, net consists primarily of income from the amortization of the discount on accounts receivable long term, net of interest expense on the Company’s credit facility.  
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease guidance under FASB ASC Topic 840, Leases, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term from operating leases. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition, lessees and lessors were originally required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. In July 2018, FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements. This update still requires modified retrospective transition; however, it adds the option to initially apply the new standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment in the current period instead of at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Under this option, comparative periods presented in the financial statements in which the new lease standard is adopted will continue to be presented in accordance with prior guidance.  
 The Company adopted the new accounting standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition option. The new standard provides optional practical expedients in transition, which the Company has elected as a package permitting the Company to not reassess under the new standard prior conclusions regarding lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. Also, in accordance with the new standard, the Company has elected in transition and for an ongoing basis not to apply the recognition requirements for all short-term leases.  
 The adoption of the new standard had a material effect on the Company’s financial statements, with the most significant effects of adoption relating to (1) the recognition of new right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet for real estate operating leases; and (2) providing significant new disclosures about its leasing activities. Upon adoption, the Company recognized operating lease liabilities of approximately $3.0 million based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments for existing operating leases. The Company also recognized corresponding right-of-use assets, net of lease incentives of approximately $2.2 million. There was no impact to stockholders’ equity from the adoption.  
 In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ("ASU No. 2016-13"). ASU No. 2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 on its Consolidated Financial Statements, particularly its recognition of allowances for accounts receivable.  
permits the reclassification of stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA” or “U.S. tax reform”) from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings. The new standard became effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 In June 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2018-07, “Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2018-07”), which aligns the measurement and classification guidance for share-based payments to nonemployees with that for employees, with certain exceptions. It expands the scope of ASC 718 to include share-based payments granted to nonemployees in exchange for goods or services used or consumed in the entity’s own operations and supersedes the guidance in ASC 505-50. The ASU retains the existing cost attribution guidance, which requires entities to recognize compensation cost for nonemployee awards in the same period and in the same manner (i.e., capitalize or expense) they would if they paid cash for the goods or services, but it moves the guidance to ASC 718. The new standard became effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-09 – Codification Improvements (“ASU 2018-09”), which facilitates amendments to a variety of topics to clarify, correct errors in, or make minor improvements to the accounting standards codification. The effective date of the standard is dependent on the facts and circumstances of each amendment. Some amendments do not require transition guidance and will be effective upon the issuance of this standard. A majority of the amendments in ASU 2018-09 became effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 We use net income excluding separation expenses, net of taxes and diluted earnings per share excluding separation expenses, net of taxes as supplemental measures of our performance to gain insight into comparison of our businesses’ profitability when compared to the prior year. We provided a reconciliation of net income excluding separation expenses, net of taxes to net income and diluted earnings per share excluding separation expenses, net of taxes to diluted earnings per share, which are the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Our use of net income excluding separation expenses, net of taxes and diluted earnings per share excluding separation expenses, net of taxes has limitations, and you should not consider it in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate separation expenses, net of taxes, or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.  
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2018  
 Net Sales  
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased 9%, or $4.5 million, to $52.4 million compared to $47.9 million for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted gross billings for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased 11%, or $15.1 million, to $149.1 million compared to $134.0 million for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted gross billings increased at a higher rate than net sales primarily due to a higher percentage of adjusted gross billings being comprised of Software – security and highly interdependent with support and maintenance, support and other services, which are recorded on a net basis.  
 Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased $4.7 million, or 11%, to $48.8 million compared to $44.1 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was due primarily to sales growth in several of our more significant product lines, as well as incremental sales from new product lines added during 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted gross billings for the Lifeboat Distribution segment for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased $21.2 million, or 17%, to $143.2 million compared to $122.0 million for the same period in the prior year.   
 TechXtend segment net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019 decreased $0.2 million, or 6%, to $3.6 million compared to $3.8 million for the same period in the prior year. Sales in our TechXtend segment may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of IT spending decisions by our larger customers and internal capital allocation decisions regarding capital we allocate to our extended payment program. Adjusted gross billings for the TechXtend segment for the three months ended September 30, 2019 decreased $6.1million, or 51%, to $5.9 million compared to $12.0 million for the same period in the prior year.   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2019, we relied on two key customers for a total of 36% of our net sales, with one of these customers accounting for 19% and the other customer accounting for 17% of our total net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2019. The Company had two major customers that accounted for 37% and 16%, respectively, of its total net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2018. The Company had two major vendors that accounted for 22% and 18%, respectively, of total purchases during the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 23% and 15%, respectively, of total purchases during the three months ended September 30, 2018.   
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased 12%, or $0.8 million, to $7.1 million compared to $6.3 million for the same period in the prior year.

TechXtend segment gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2019 remained consistent with the same period in the prior year at $0.7 million.  
 Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was 13.5% compared to 13.2% for the same period in the prior year. The change in gross profit margin is significantly impacted by changes in the percentage mix of our products which are recorded net of the related cost of sales, and hardware and software product sales which are reported on a gross basis. During the three months ended September 30, 2019 approximately 9.3% of our net sales was attributable to security, maintenance and third-party service products which are recorded on a net basis, or an effective 100% gross profit margin, compared to 8.0% for the same period in the prior year. This shift in product mix had the effect of increasing gross profit as a percent of net sales by 120 basis points. This increase was partially offset by lower gross profit margin on software and hardware products recorded on a gross basis. Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was 13.1% compared to 12.8% for the same period in the prior year. TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was 18.9% compared to 17.6% for the same period in the prior year.

 Our cash and cash equivalents decreased to $10.2 million as of September 30, 2019 compared to $14.9 million as of December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of $2.4 million of cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities and $2.3 million of cash used for dividends.
