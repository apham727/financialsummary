We grant credit to customers in the ordinary course of business.
Credit evaluations are performed on an ongoing basis to reduce credit risk, and no collateral is required from our customers.
An allowance for uncollectible accounts is provided for those accounts receivable considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and credit evaluation.
As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, none of our customers individually accounted for 10% or more of our gross accounts receivable.
Historically, we have not recorded material losses due to customers nonpayment.
Our Creative Professional business consists of a higher volume of lower dollar value transactions.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.
Interest Rate Risk  



Our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt.
At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility of $80.0 million and $93.0 million, respectively.
The interest rate on our Credit Facility fluctuates with either the prime rate or the LIBOR interest rate and at September 30, 2018 our rate was 3.8% for LIBOR.
A 10% increase in the rate would increase our annual interest expense by $0.2 million.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  



In accordance with ASC Topic No.
830, Foreign Currency Matters, or ASC 830, all assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate as of the balance sheet date.
As discussed in Note 1, our wholly-owned Olapic Argentina S.A. subsidiary employs approximately 99 people whose functions mainly include development, sales support and administration.
The Argentinian economy was recently determined to be highly inflationary.
Argentinas inflation rate reached this threshold with the quarterly period ended June 30, 2018.
In accordance with this designation, we were required to apply the guidance in ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters, (Subtopic ASC 830-10-45-10), and account for a change in functional currency from the Argentinian peso to the U.S. dollar effective July 1, 2018.
While we conduct our operation in Argentina Pesos, effective July 1, 2018, the functional currency was changed to the U.S. dollar.
The operation is a service center supporting the companys products and generates no revenue.
For the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States, primarily EMEA and Japan, comprised 54.5% and 53.8%, respectively, of our total revenue.
An effect of a 10% strengthening of the British pound sterling, the Euro and/or Japanese yen, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have increased our revenues by $2.0 million, increased expenses by $1.8 million and increased operating income by $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, revenue from customers outside the United States, primarily EMEA and Japan, comprised 55.3% and 56.3%, respectively, of our total revenue.
An effect of a 10% strengthening of the British pound sterling, the Euro and/or Japanese yen, relative to the U.S. dollar, would have increased our revenues by $6.0 million, increased expenses by $5.8 million and increased operating income by $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
In the period from that date until payment in the customers functional currency is received and converted into U.S. dollars, we can incur realized gains and losses.
We are currently utilizing 30-day forward contracts to mitigate our exposure on these currency fluctuations.
Any increase or decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged assets of our consolidated foreign affiliate.
At September 30, 2018, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.6 million British pounds sterling and to purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value.
At December 31, 2017, we had one 30-day forward contract to sell 2.5 million British pounds sterling and to purchase $3.4 million that together, had an immaterial fair value.
