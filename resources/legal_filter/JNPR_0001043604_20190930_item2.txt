Item 2.
We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by applicable law.
The following discussion is based upon our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 1, Item I, of this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP.
In making these decisions, we consider various factors, including contractual obligations, customer satisfaction, competition, internal and external financial targets and expectations, and financial planning objectives.
Each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period.
To aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this Report, we have provided an executive overview, which includes a summary of our business and market environment along with a financial results and key performance metrics overview.
Our products are sold in three geographic regions: Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA; and Asia Pacific, or APAC.
We sell our high-performance network products and service offerings across routing, switching, and security technologies.
In addition to our products, we offer our customers services, including maintenance and support, professional services, and education and training programs.
Our products and services address high-performance network requirements for our customers within our verticals: Cloud, Service Provider, and Enterprise, who view their network as critical to their success.
We believe our silicon, systems, and software represent innovations that transform the economics and experience of networking, helping our customers achieve superior performance, greater choice, and flexibility, while reducing overall total cost of ownership.
Further, our intent is to expand our software business by introducing new software solutions to our product portfolio that simplify the operation of networks, and allow our customers across our key verticals flexibility in consumption and deployment.
We believe our software and related services revenues as a percentage of total revenues will increase over time as we introduce new software solutions designed to better monetize the value of software functionality in our offerings.
We believe the network needs for our customers in our Cloud, Service Provider, and Enterprise verticals are converging, as these customers recognize the need for high performance networks and are adopting cloud architectures for their infrastructure and service delivery, such as large public and private data centers and service provider edge data centers, for improved agility and greater levels of operating efficiency.
37

We remain confident in our strategy and we are executing against our innovation roadmap, as each of our industry verticals transitions to cloud architectures.
In the third quarter of 2019, we experienced weakness within our Service Provider vertical, which we believe is due to continued business challenges facing some of our largest Service Provider customers.
Enterprise has increased sequentially over the past two quarters driven by demand in our U.S. federal business as well as broad Enterprise strength, and we expect another sequential increase in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Our Cloud vertical has returned to year-over-year growth for the past two quarters and we expect our Cloud vertical to grow in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to the same quarter in 2018, as we continued to see momentum within our customers' wide area networks, particularly from certain of our switching products.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2018



During the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, total operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower research and development, or R&D costs, and general and administrative, or G&A costs.
Our G&A costs decreased primarily related to the accrual established during the three months ended September 30, 2018, for the FCPA settlement with the SEC.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018



During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, total operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower personnel-related expenses, driven by a decrease in share-based compensation expense, specifically in R&D, and lower salaries and wages driven by a decrease in headcount as a result of restructuring actions, specifically in S&M.
Our G&A increased primarily due to costs related to the acquisition of Mist Systems, partially offset by the accrual established during the three months ended September 30, 2018, for the FCPA settlement with the SEC.
The decrease in total operating expenses was also partially offset by higher restructuring charges in connection with a restructuring plan that was initiated in the first quarter of 2019 (the "2019 Restructuring Plan").
During the second quarter of 2019, the Company amended the 2019 Restructuring Plan and undertook certain further actions that resulted in additional severance, additional facility consolidation, and contract termination costs.

Total other expense, net increased during the three months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018



Total other expense, net decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in interest income related to our fixed income investment portfolio, as a result of higher yields, partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt.
44

Income Tax Provision (Benefit)



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The effective tax rate increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same periods in 2018, primarily due to a change in the level of discrete items in the comparative period.
On July 24, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, or the Court, issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner requiring related parties in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement to share expenses related to share-based compensation.
On June 7, 2019, the Court upheld the cost-sharing regulations, subject to the right of appeal by Altera.
On July 22, 2019, Altera petitioned the Court for rehearing.
If a judicial decision against Altera had been finalized in the reporting period, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 would have been higher.
As a result of recommendations by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, certain countries have either enacted new corporate tax legislation or are considering enacting such legislation in the near future.
We expect the effect of these reform measures to potentially impact long-standing tax principles, particularly in regard to transfer pricing.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Operating Activities



Net cash provided by operations decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018.
The decrease was primarily due to lower cash collections from customers as a result of lower invoicing, partially offset by a decrease in cash payments to suppliers.
Investing Activities



Net cash used in investing activities was $704.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $730.0 million for the same period in 2018.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the payment for the acquisition of Mist was $270.9 million and net purchases of investments was $349.7 million.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, net proceeds from sales, maturities and redemptions of investments was $872.4 million, primarily from the liquidation of repatriated offshore investments to fund the ASR discussed below.
Financing Activities



Net cash used in financing activities increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018.
The nine months ended September 30, 2019 payments were primarily comprised of $454.8 million net repayments of debt and payments of $350.0 million under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.
The nine months ended September 30, 2018 payments were primarily comprised of $750.0 million under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.

Capital Return



In January 2018, our Board of Directors, which we refer to as the Board, approved a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, which we refer to as the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.
As part of the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, in February 2018, we entered into an ASR to repurchase $750.0 million of our common stock.
We made an up-front payment of $750.0 million pursuant to the ASR to repurchase our common stock.
The aggregate number of shares ultimately repurchased of 29.3 million shares of common stock was determined based on a volume weighted average repurchase price, less an agreed upon discount, of $25.62 per share.
On April 29, 2019, we entered into an ASR, to repurchase an aggregate of approximately $300.0 million of our outstanding common stock.
During the second quarter of 2019, we made an up-front payment of $300.0 million pursuant to the ASR and received and retired an initial 8.6 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of $240.0 million based on the market value of our common stock on the date of the transaction.
During the third quarter of 2019, the ASR was completed, and we received and retired an additional 3.0 million shares, based on volume weighted average repurchase price, less an agreed upon discount, of $25.79 per share.
The completion of the ASR resulted in a total repurchase of 11.6 million shares of our common stock.
During the third quarter of 2019, we also repurchased 2.1 million shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $50.0 million at an average price of $23.63 per share.
As of September 30, 2019, there was approximately $900.0 million of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.
On October 24, 2019, we announced that the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.0 billion of common stock under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.
On October 28, 2019, we entered into an ASR with a financial institution to repurchase an aggregate of $200.0 million of our outstanding common stock (the “October 2019 ASR”).
We made an up-front payment of $200.0 million pursuant to the October 2019 ASR and received and retired an initial 6.4 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of $160.0 million based on the market value of our common stock on the date of the transaction.
We have an aggregate of $1.7 billion of authorized funds remaining under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program, as of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Future share repurchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will be subject to a review of the circumstances at that time and will be made from time to time in private transactions or open market purchases as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements.
Our 2018 Stock Repurchase Program does not have a specified termination date, but may be discontinued at any time.
See Note 10, Equity, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Report for further discussion of our share purchase program.
We declared and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share, totaling $64.7 million and $196.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively.
Any future dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, are subject to approval by the Board or an authorized committee thereof.
See Note 16, Subsequent Events, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Report for discussion of our dividend declaration subsequent to September 30, 2019.
Contractual Obligations



As of September 30, 2019, our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases, purchase commitments, debt, and other contractual obligations.
There have been no significant changes to these obligations, during the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the contractual obligations disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, set forth in Part II, Item 7, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, other than the obligations listed in the table below (in millions):

Revolving Credit Facility



In April 2019, we entered into a new credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a five-year $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), with an option to increase the Revolving Credit Facility by up to an additional $200.0 million, subject to the lenders' approval.
The Prior Revolving Credit Facility was terminated substantially concurrently with our entering into the Revolving Credit Facility.
The Revolving Credit Facility will terminate in April 2024, subject to two one-year maturity extension options, on the terms and conditions as set forth in the credit agreement.
As of September 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants in the Credit Agreement, and no amounts were outstanding.
Following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”), we repatriated approximately $3.0 billion of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance from outside of the U.S. as of September 30, 2019.
We expect the new territorial tax system to provide us with lower cost access to nearly all of our global free cash flow on an ongoing basis.
Free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.
See Note 16, Subsequent Events, in Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Report for our subsequent events impacting liquidity.
