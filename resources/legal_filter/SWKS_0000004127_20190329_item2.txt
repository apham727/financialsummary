NET REVENUE



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We market and sell our products directly to OEMs of communications and electronics products, third-party original design manufacturers and contract manufacturers, and indirectly through electronic components distributors.
16

We generated net revenue of $810.4 million for the three months ended March 29, 2019, a decrease of $103.0 million or 11.3%, as compared with $913.4 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 2018.
Net revenue decreased by 9.3% or $182.9 million to $1,782.4 million for the six months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with $1,965.3 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 2018.
This decrease in net revenue for the three and six months ended March 29, 2019, is primarily related to weakness in smartphone demand, partially offset by the increasing number of applications of the Internet of Things, our expanding analog product portfolio supporting new vertical markets including automotive, consumer, industrial, infrastructure, medical, and military, and our success in capturing a higher share of the increasing radio frequency and analog content per device as smartphone models continue to evolve.
GROSS PROFIT



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Gross profit represents net revenue less cost of goods sold.
Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials, labor and overhead (including depreciation and share-based compensation expense) associated with product manufacturing.
Erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the semiconductor industry.
These negative impacts were partially offset by favorable product mix that positively impacted gross profit by $69.9 million.
Gross profit margin decreased to 49.4% of net revenue for the three months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with 50.2% in the corresponding period in fiscal 2018.
The $110.1 million decrease in gross profit for the six months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, was primarily the result of lower average selling prices and lower unit volumes with a gross profit impact of $298.7 million.
These negative impacts were partially offset by favorable product mix that positively impacted gross profit by $188.6 million.
Gross profit margin decreased to 49.7% of net revenue for the six months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with 50.7% in the corresponding period in fiscal 2018.
The increase in research and development expenses for the three and six months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with the corresponding periods in fiscal 2018, was primarily related to an increase in employee-related compensation expense and product development–related expenses.
Research and development expense increased as a percentage of net revenue, when compared with the corresponding periods in fiscal 2018, as a result of our increased investment in developing new technologies and products, as well as the decline in revenue.
SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE



 17

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Selling, general and administrative expenses include legal and related costs, accounting, treasury, human resources, information systems, customer service, bad debt expense, sales commissions, share-based compensation expense, advertising, marketing, costs associated with business combinations completed or contemplated during the period and other costs.
The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with the corresponding periods in fiscal 2018, was primarily related to a decrease in share-based compensation expense.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended March 29, 2019, decreased as a percentage of net revenue, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, due to the decrease in share-based compensation expense.
AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



During the three and six months ended March 29, 2019, $7.4 million and $15.5 million in amortization of intangibles were included in cost of goods sold, respectively, and $5.7 million and $13.1 million in amortization of intangibles were included in selling, general and administrative expense, respectively.
During the three and six months ended March 30, 2018, $1.5 million and $3.0 million in amortization of intangibles were included in cost of goods sold, respectively, and $4.1 million and $8.1 million in amortization of intangibles were included in selling, general and administrative expense, respectively.
The increase in amortization expense for the three and six months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with the corresponding periods in fiscal 2018, was primarily due to amortization attributable to the Avnera acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We recorded a provision for income taxes of $27.3 million (which consisted of $21.3 million and $6.0 million related to United States and foreign income taxes, respectively) and $66.3 million (which consisted of $50.9 million and $15.4 million related to United States and foreign income taxes, respectively) for the three and six months ended March 29, 2019, respectively.
The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended March 29, 2019, were 11.4% and 11.8%, respectively, as compared with 5.6% and 48.9% for the three and six months ended March 30, 2018, respectively.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



 18

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Cash provided by operating activities:



Cash provided by operating activities consists of net income for the period adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain operating assets and liabilities.
During the six months ended March 29, 2019, we generated $741.1 million of cash from operating activities, a decrease of $53.9 million as compared with the $795.0 million generated during the six months ended March 30, 2018.
The decrease in cash from operating activities during the six months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2018, was primarily related to an increase in working capital.
Cash used in investing activities:



Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid related to the purchase of marketable securities, offset by cash received related to the sale or maturity of marketable securities.
Cash used in investing activities was $96.6 million during the six months ended March 29, 2019, as compared with $124.5 million during the six months ended March 30, 2018.
Purchases of marketable securities were $166.7 million and sales and maturities of marketable securities were $309.2 million during the six months ended March 29, 2019.
Cash used in financing activities:



Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of cash transactions related to equity.
During the six months ended March 29, 2019, we had net cash outflows from financing activities of $561.5 million, as compared with net cash outflows from financing activities of $406.0 million during the six months ended March 30, 2018.
During the six months ended March 29, 2019, we had the following significant uses of cash:



•$425.5 million related to our repurchase of 5.7 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors on January 30, 2019, and January 31, 2018.
•$133.1 million related to the payment of cash dividends on our common stock.
Liquidity:



Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $991.3 million as of March 29, 2019, representing a decrease of $58.9 million from September 28, 2018.
The decrease resulted from $425.5 million used to repurchase 5.7 million shares of stock, $133.1 million in cash dividend payments, and $226.2 million in capital expenditures, which was partially offset by $741.1 million in cash generated from operations.
Based on our historical results of operations, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, working capital, quarterly cash dividend payments (if such dividends are declared by the Board of Directors), outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with existing operations for at least the next 12 months.
However, we cannot be certain that our cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be available in the future to fund all of our capital and operating requirements.
Our invested cash balances primarily consist of highly liquid marketable securities that are available to meet near-term cash requirements including: term deposits, certificate of deposits, money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, other government securities, corporate debt securities and commercial paper.
