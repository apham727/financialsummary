Item 4.
Controls and Procedures.
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met.
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
During the three months ended March 30, 2019, we implemented a new lease accounting system and related internal controls in response to the adoption of ASU No.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” effective December 30, 2018.
