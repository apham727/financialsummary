Note 1: Basis of Presentation



Basis of Presentation



The accompanying Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of HP and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are prepared in conformity with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
The interim financial information is unaudited but reflects all normal adjustments that are necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented.
This interim information should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on December 13, 2018.
The Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet for October 31, 2018 was derived from audited financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation



The Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements include the accounts of HP and its subsidiaries and affiliates in which HP has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Reclassifications



Effective at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2019, HP implemented an organizational change to align its business unit financial reporting more closely with its current business structure.
HP reflected this change to its business unit information in prior reporting periods on an as-if basis.
HP has reclassified certain prior-year amounts to conform to the current-year presentation as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-07, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post-retirement Benefit Cost”.
This adoption had no impact on previously reported consolidated net revenue, net earnings or net EPS.
For detailed discussion, see Note 2, “Segment Information”.
Separation Transaction



 On November 1, 2015, Hewlett-Packard Company completed the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“Hewlett Packard Enterprise”), Hewlett-Packard Company’s former enterprise technology infrastructure, software, services and financing businesses (the “Separation”).
In connection with the Separation, HP entered into a separation and distribution agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement and various other agreements with Hewlett Packard Enterprise that provide a framework for the relationships between the parties.
For more information on the impacts of these agreements, see Note 6, “Supplementary Financial Information”, Note 12, “Litigation and Contingencies” and Note 13, “Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties”.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance, which addresses the improvement of the presentation of net periodic pension and net periodic post-retirement benefit cost.
The guidance requires entities to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period.
Additionally, the guidance requires that companies present the other components of the net periodic benefit cost separately from the line item that includes service cost and any other subtotal of income from operations.
A practical expedient allows companies to use the amount disclosed in its pension and other post-retirement plan note for the prior comparative periods as the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements.
HP adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and elected to use the practical expedient.
The adoption of this guidance has no impact on net earnings.
The reclassification resulted in an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses and a reduction in interest and other, net of $60 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018.
In November 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which addresses the presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows.
The guidance requires entities to present the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows.
As a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows.
HP adopted this guidance in the

Note 1: Basis of Presentation (Continued)



first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which amends the existing accounting for Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.
The guidance (Topic 740) requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs.
It also requires modified retrospective transition with a cumulative catch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption.
HP adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
The implementation of this guidance resulted in $353 million of net reduction to its prepaid tax asset adjusted through accumulated deficit.
In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which amends the existing accounting standards for the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows.
HP adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which amends the existing accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities.
The guidance (Topic 825-10) primarily addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
The amendments should be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, with other amendments related specifically to equity securities without readily determinable fair values applied prospectively.
HP adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance, which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.
The amendments (Topic 606) are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
HP adopted the new revenue standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective method applied to contracts that were not completed as of November 1, 2018.
HP has recognized the net impact of adoption as an increase to accumulated deficit by $212 million, net of tax.
The primary changes that impact the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements are as below:



Variable consideration - HP estimates the transaction price for elements of consideration which are variable in nature.
Certain distributor programs and incentive offerings which were recorded at the date the sales incentives were offered, will now be recorded at the time of revenue recognition based on estimates.
The adoption has led to certain balance sheet reclassifications pertaining to return asset and liability and repurchase reserves which impacts accounts receivable, net, inventory, other current assets and other accrued liabilities balances.
Revenue Recognition



General



HP recognizes revenues at a point in time or over time depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which HP expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
HP follows the five-step model for revenue recognition as summarized below:



1.Identify the contract with a customer - A contract with customer exists when (i) it is approved and signed by all parties, (ii) each party’s rights and obligations can be identified, (iii) payment terms are defined, (iv) it has commercial substance and (v) the customer has the ability and intent to pay.
2.Identify the performance obligations in the contract - HP evaluates each performance obligation in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting, such as hardware and/or service.
A performance obligation constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the performance obligation is distinct within the context of the contract.
3.Determine the transaction price - Transaction price is the amount of consideration to which HP expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer.
If the transaction price includes a variable amount, HP estimates the amount it expects to be entitled to using either the expected value or most likely amount method.
The selling price for each performance obligation is based on its standalone selling price (“SSP”).
HP establishes SSP using the price charged for a performance obligation when sold separately (“observable price”) and, in some instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority.
HP generally invoices the customer upon delivery of the goods or services and the payments are due as per contract terms.
For fixed price support or maintenance contracts that are in the nature of stand-ready obligations, payments are generally received in advance from customers and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over time for the duration of the contract.
HP records revenue on a gross basis when HP is a principal in the transaction and on a net basis when HP is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor.
Services 



HP recognizes revenue from fixed-price support, maintenance and other service contracts over time depicting the pattern of service delivery and recognizes the costs associated with these contracts as incurred.
Contract Assets and Liabilities



Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that HP has transferred to a customer when such right is conditional on something other than the passage of time.
Such contract assets are insignificant to HP’s Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.
HP is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
Earlier adoption is permitted.
In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance, which amends the existing accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.
HP is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
Earlier adoption is permitted.
In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which requires credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, not based on incurred losses.
Further, credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost.
HP is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.
Earlier adoption is permitted.
In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which amends the existing accounting standards for leases.
Consistent with current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification.
Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases with lease terms of more than twelve months.
HP will adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 using a modified retrospective transition approach.
HP is in the process of completing the evaluation of the impacts from the new lease accounting standard.
Based on the current assessment, HP expects the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet.

Note 2.
Segment Information 



HP is a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies, solutions and services.
HP sells to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors.
HP’s operations are organized into three reportable segments: Personal Systems, Printing and Corporate Investments.
HP’s organizational structure is based on many factors that the chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate, view and run its business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology.
The segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by HP’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment results.
The chief operating decision maker uses several metrics to evaluate the performance of the overall business, including earnings from operations, and uses these results to allocate resources to each of the segments.
HP groups Commercial notebooks, Commercial desktops, Commercial services, Commercial mobility devices, Commercial detachables and convertibles, Workstations, retail POS systems and thin clients into Commercial PCs and Consumer notebooks, Consumer desktops, Consumer services and Consumer detachables into Consumer PCs when describing performance in these markets.

Note 2: Segment Information (Continued)



Printing groups its global business capabilities into the following business units when reporting business performance:



•Commercial Hardware consists of Office Printing Solutions, Graphics Solutions and 3D Printing, excluding Supplies;



•Consumer Hardware consists of Home Printing Solutions, excluding Supplies; and



•Supplies comprises a set of highly innovative consumable products, ranging from Ink and Laser cartridges to media, graphics supplies and 3D printing supplies, for recurring use in Consumer and Commercial Hardware.
Corporate Investments includes HP Labs and certain business incubation projects.
The accounting policies HP uses to derive segment results are substantially the same as those used by HP in preparing these financial statements.
HP derives the results of the business segments directly from its internal management reporting system.
HP does not allocate certain operating expenses, which it manages at the corporate level, to its segments.
Pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2017-07 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, HP now reclassifies market-related retirement credits and all other components (excluding the service cost component) of net periodic benefit cost to Interest and other, net in Consolidated Condensed Statement of Earnings.
HP reflected this change in prior reporting periods on an as-if basis.
This adoption did not have a material impact to previously reported segment earnings from operations.
Realignment



Effective at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2019, HP implemented an organizational change to align its business unit financial reporting more closely with its current business structure.
The organizational change resulted in the transfer of certain Samsung-branded product categories from Commercial to Consumer within the Printing segment.
HP reflected this change to its business unit information in prior reporting periods on an as-if basis.
The reporting change had no impact to previously reported segment net revenue, consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or net EPS.
HP does not expect any further material activity associated with these plans.
Fiscal 2017 Plan



On October 10, 2016, HP’s Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the “Fiscal 2017 Plan”), which HP expected would be implemented through fiscal year 2019.
On May 26, 2018, HP’s Board of Directors approved amending the Fiscal 2017 Plan.
HP expects approximately 4,500 to 5,000 employees to exit by the end of fiscal year 2019.
HP estimates that it will incur aggregate pre-tax charges of approximately $700 million relating to labor and non-labor actions.
For the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, HP incurred $2 million and $13 million of other charges, respectively.

Note 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans 



The components of HP’s pension and post-retirement benefit (credit) cost recognized in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Employer Contributions and Funding Policy



HP’s policy is to fund its pension plans so that it makes at least the minimum contribution required by local government, funding and taxing authorities.
During fiscal year 2019, HP anticipates making contributions of approximately $46 million to its non-U.S. pension plans, approximately $32 million to its U.S. non-qualified plan participants and approximately $6 million to cover benefit claims under HP’s post-retirement benefit plans.
During the three months ended January 31, 2019, HP contributed $11 million to its non-U.S. pension plans, paid $6 million to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants, and paid $2 million to cover benefit claims under HP’s post-retirement benefit plans.
HP’s pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions.
Given the significance of the legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (SAB 118) in December 2017, which allows registrants to record provisional amounts during a one year “measurement period”.
As of January 31, 2019, HP has completed its accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA with no material changes to the provisional amounts recorded during the measurement period.
HP has elected to treat the Global Minimum Tax inclusions as period costs.

Note 5: Taxes on Earnings (Continued)



HP’s effective tax rate was 10.8% and (114.1)% for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
During the three months ended January 31, 2019, HP recorded $9 million of net tax benefits related to discrete items in the provision for taxes.
As noted above, HP has completed its analysis of the full impact of TCJA.
In addition to the discrete items mentioned above, HP recorded excess tax benefits of $27 million on stock options, restricted stock units and performance-adjusted restricted stock units.
During the three months ended January 31, 2018, HP recorded $1.1 billion of net tax benefits related to discrete items in the provision for taxes.
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased by $39 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019.
As of January 31, 2019 and 2018, HP had accrued $181 million and $278 million, respectively, for interest and penalties.

Accounts Receivable, net



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable and changes were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



HP has third-party arrangements, consisting of revolving short-term financing, which provide liquidity to certain partners in order to facilitate their working capital requirements.
As these transfers qualify as true sales under the applicable accounting guidance, the receivables are derecognized from the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets upon transfer, and HP receives a payment for the receivables from the third party within a mutually agreed upon time period.
For arrangements involving an element of recourse, the recourse obligation is measured using market data from the similar transactions and reported as a current liability in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.
The recourse obligations as of January 31, 2019 and October 31, 2018 were not material.
The costs associated with the sales of trade receivables for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 were not material.
The following is a summary of the activity under these arrangements:

Value of Remaining Performance Obligations



As of January 31, 2019, the estimated value of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $4.5 billion.
HP expects to recognize approximately $1.8 billion of the unearned amount in next 12 months and $2.7 billion thereafter.
HP has elected the practical expedients and accordingly does not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if: 



•the contract has an original expected duration of one year or less; or



•the revenue from the performance obligation is recognized over time on an as-invoiced basis when the amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer; or



•the portion of the transaction price that is variable in nature is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation.

Note 7: Fair Value



Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair Value Hierarchy



HP uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs are developed using market data such as publicly available information and reflect the assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using the best information available about the assumptions market participants would use.
Assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:



Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2—Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs.
Level 3—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs and lowest priority to unobservable inputs.
The following table presents HP’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Government debt includes instruments such as U.S. treasury notes, U.S agency securities and non-U.S. government bonds.
Money market funds invested in government debt and traded in active markets are included in Level 1.
There were no transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy during the three months ended January 31, 2019.

Note 7: Fair Value (Continued)



Valuation Techniques



Cash Equivalents and Investments: HP holds time deposits, money market funds, mutual funds, other debt securities primarily consisting of corporate and government notes and bonds, and common stock and equivalents.
HP values cash equivalents and equity investments using quoted market prices, alternative pricing sources, including net asset value, or models utilizing market observable inputs.
HP uses industry standard valuation models to measure fair value.
See Note 8, “Financial Instruments” for a further discussion of HP’s use of derivative instruments.
The portion of HP’s debt that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets as an amount equal to the debt’s carrying amount and a fair value adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligations arising from movements in benchmark interest rates.
The fair value of HP’s short- and long-term debt was $5.1 billion as of January 31, 2019, compared to its carrying amount of $5.0 billion at that date.
The fair value of HP’s short- and long-term debt was $6.0 billion as of October 31, 2018, compared to its carrying value of $6.0 billion at that date.
If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets, short- and long-term debt would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Other Financial Instruments: For the balance of HP’s financial instruments, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and financial liabilities included in Other accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets, these other financial instruments would be classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Non-Marketable Equity Investments and Non-Financial Assets: HP’s non-marketable equity investments are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative resulting from qualifying observable adjustments or impairment.
HP’s non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, goodwill and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value in the period an impairment charge is recognized.
If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets these would generally be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Note 8: Financial Instruments



Cash Equivalents and Available-for-Sale Investments



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) HP classifies its marketable debt securities as available-for-sale investments within Other current assets on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, based on their highly liquid nature and availability for use in current operations.
All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents.
As of January 31, 2019 and October 31, 2018, the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximated fair value due to the short period of time to maturity.
These amounted to $49 million and $36 million as of January 31, 2019 and October 31, 2018, respectively.
As part of its risk management strategy, HP uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, interest rate swaps, total return swaps and, at times, option contracts to hedge certain foreign currency, interest rate and, return on certain investment exposures.
HP may designate its derivative contracts as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges and classifies the cash flows with the activities that correspond to the underlying hedged items.
Additionally, for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, HP categorizes those economic hedges as other derivatives.
HP recognizes all derivative instruments at fair value in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.
As a result of its use of derivative instruments, HP is exposed to the risk that its counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations.
Master netting agreements mitigate credit exposure to counterparties by permitting HP to net amounts due from HP to counterparty against amounts due to HP from the same counterparty under certain conditions.
To further limit credit risk, HP has collateral security agreements that allow HP’s custodian to hold collateral from, or require HP to post collateral to, counterparties when aggregate derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds which are generally based on the credit ratings of HP and its counterparties.
If HP’s or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, either party has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives’ net liability position.
The fair value of derivatives with credit contingent features in a net liability position was $85 million and $68 million as of January 31, 2019 and as of October 31, 2018, respectively, all of which were fully collateralized within two business days.
Under HP’s derivative contracts, the counterparty can terminate all outstanding trades following a covered change of control event affecting HP that results in the surviving entity being rated below a specified credit rating.
This credit contingent provision did not affect HP’s financial position or cash flows as of January 31, 2019 and October 31, 2018.
Fair Value Hedges



HP enters into fair value hedges, such as interest rate swaps, to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving a primarily U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)-based floating interest expense.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, HP recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings in the period of change.
Cash Flow Hedges



HP uses forward contracts and at times, option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
HP’s foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally within twelve months.
However, hedges related to longer-term procurement arrangements extend several years and forward contracts associated with intercompany loans extend for the duration of the loan term, which typically range from two to five years.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, HP initially records changes in fair value for the effective portion of the derivative instrument in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders’ deficit on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings.
HP reports the effective portion of its cash flow hedges in the same financial statement line item as changes in the fair value of the hedged item.
Other Derivatives



Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts used to hedge foreign currency-denominated balance sheet exposures.
HP uses total return swaps to hedge its executive deferred compensation plan liability.
For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, HP recognizes changes in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings in the period of change.
Hedge Effectiveness



For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, HP measures hedge effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged item with the change in fair value of the derivative.
For foreign currency options and forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, HP measures hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates.
Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings in the period they arise.
As of January 31, 2019 and 2018, no portion of the hedging instruments’ gain or loss was excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for fair value and cash flow hedges.
Hedge ineffectiveness for fair value and cash flow hedges recognized in earnings were not material for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and 2018.
Fair Value of Derivative Instruments in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets



The gross notional and fair value of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Offsetting of Derivative Instruments



HP recognizes all derivative instruments on a gross basis in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.
HP does not offset the fair value of its derivative instruments against the fair value of cash collateral posted under its collateral security agreements.
(2) Represents the collateral posted by HP through re-use of counterparty cash collateral as of the respective reporting date for HP’s liability position, net of derivative amounts that could be offset, as of, generally, two business days prior to the respective reporting date.
Effect of Derivative Instruments in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings



Interest rate swaps agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the derivative recognized in interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged.
Loss on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings was $12 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019 and $40 million for the three months ended January 31, 2018.
Gains and losses are fully offset by changes in the fair value of the debt being hedged.
The U.S. Dollar Global Notes are senior unsecured debt.
As disclosed in Note 8, “Financial Instruments”, HP uses interest rate swaps to mitigate some of the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving a primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest expense.
Interest rates shown in the table of long-term debt have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any interest rate swaps.
Commercial Paper



As of January 31, 2019, HP maintained two commercial paper programs.
HP’s euro commercial paper program provides for the issuance of commercial paper outside of the United States denominated in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $6.0 billion or the equivalent in those alternative currencies.

Note 12: Litigation and Contingencies



HP is involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including those identified below, consisting of IP, commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business.
Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, HP shares responsibility with Hewlett Packard Enterprise for certain matters, as indicated below, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise has agreed to indemnify HP in whole or in part with respect to certain matters.
Based on its experience, HP believes that any damage amounts claimed in the specific matters discussed below are not a meaningful indicator of HP’s potential liability.
Litigation is inherently unpredictable.
However, HP believes it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it.
Litigation, Proceedings and Investigations



Copyright Levies.
HP, other companies and various industry associations have opposed the extension of levies to the digital environment and have advocated alternative models of compensation to rights holders.
Reprobel, a collecting society administering the remuneration for reprography to Belgian copyright holders, requested by extrajudicial means that HP amend certain copyright levy declarations submitted for inkjet MFDs sold in Belgium from January 2005 to December 2009 to enable it to collect copyright levies calculated based on the generally higher copying speed when the

MFDs are operated in draft print mode rather than when operated in normal print mode.
The Court of Appeal in Brussels (the “Court of Appeal”) stayed the proceedings and referred several questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”).
On November 12, 2015, the CJEU published its judgment providing that a national legislation such as the Belgian one at issue in the main proceedings is incompatible with EU law on multiple legal points, as argued by HP, and returned the proceedings to the referring court.
HP appealed this decision before the Belgian Supreme Court on January 18, 2018.
Based on industry opposition to the extension of levies to digital products, HP’s assessments of the merits of various proceedings and HP’s estimates of the number of units impacted and the amounts of the levies, HP has accrued amounts that it believes are adequate to address the ongoing disputes.
Hewlett-Packard Company v. Oracle Corporation.
On June 15, 2011, HP filed suit against Oracle Corporation (“Oracle”) in California Superior Court in Santa Clara County in connection with Oracle’s March 2011 announcement that it was discontinuing software support for HP’s Itanium-based line of mission-critical servers.
HP asserted, among other things, that Oracle’s actions breached the contract that was signed by the parties as part of the settlement of the litigation relating to Oracle’s hiring of Mark Hurd.
The matter eventually progressed to trial, which was bifurcated into two phases.
HP prevailed in the first phase of the trial, in which the court ruled that the contract at issue required Oracle to continue to offer its software products on HP’s Itanium-based servers for as long as HP decided to sell such servers.
On August 27, 2015, the California Court of Appeals rejected Oracle’s appeal.
The matter was remanded to the trial court for the second phase of the trial, which began on May 23, 2016 and was submitted to the jury on June 29, 2016.
On October 20, 2016, the court entered judgment for HP for this amount with interest accruing until the judgment is paid.
Oracle’s motion for a new trial was denied on December 19, 2016, and Oracle filed its notice of appeal from the trial court’s judgment on January 17, 2017.
On February 2, 2017, HP filed a notice of cross-appeal challenging the trial court’s denial of prejudgment interest.
Oracle’s opening brief is due on March 7, 2019; HP’s respondent’s/cross-opening brief is due 75 days after Oracle’s opening brief is filed; Oracle’s reply/cross-respondent’s brief is due 75 days after HP’s respondent’s/cross-opening brief is filed; and HP’s cross-reply brief is due 50 days after Oracle’s reply/cross-respondent’s brief is filed.
The Court of Appeal will schedule oral argument after the case is fully briefed.
HP expects that the appeals process could take several years to complete.
The amount ultimately awarded, if any, would be recorded in the period received.
No adjustment has been recorded in the financial statements in relation to this potential award.
Pursuant to the terms of the separation and distribution agreement, HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise will share equally in any recovery from Oracle once Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been reimbursed for all costs incurred in the prosecution of the action prior to the Separation.
Forsyth, et al.
v. HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
This is a purported class and collective action filed on August 18, 2016 in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, against HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise alleging the defendants violated the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, California public policy and the California Business and Professions Code by terminating older workers and replacing them with younger workers.
Plaintiffs originally sought to certify a nationwide collective class action under the ADEA comprised of all U.S. residents employed by defendants who had their employment terminated pursuant to a workforce reduction (“WFR”) plan on or after May 23, 2012 and who were 40 years of age or older.
Plaintiffs also originally sought to represent a Rule 23 class under California law comprised of all persons 40 years or older employed by defendants in the state of California and terminated pursuant to a WFR plan on or after May 23, 2012.
Following a partial motion to dismiss, a motion to strike and a motion to compel arbitration that the defendants filed in November 2016, the plaintiffs amended their complaint.
New plaintiffs were added, but the plaintiffs agreed that the class period for the putative nationwide ADEA collective action should be shortened and now starts, at the earliest, on December 9, 2014.
The plaintiffs also agreed that the class period for the putative California state law class action should be shortened and now starts on August 18, 2012.
On January 30, 2017, the defendants filed another partial motion to dismiss and motions to compel arbitration as to several of the plaintiffs.
On March 20, 2017, the defendants filed additional motions to compel arbitration as to a number of the opt-in plaintiffs.
On September 20, 2017, the Court granted the motions to compel arbitration as to the plaintiffs and opt-ins who

signed WFR release agreements, denied the pending motion to dismiss without prejudice, stayed the action and administratively closed the case pending the completion of the compelled arbitrations.
On November 30, 2017, three named plaintiffs and twelve opt-in plaintiffs filed a single arbitration demand.
An additional arbitration claimant was added later by stipulation.
On December 22, 2017, the defendants filed a motion to: (1) stay the claims of individuals not subject to arbitration and (2) enjoin the demanded arbitration and require each plaintiff to file a separate arbitration demand.
On February 6, 2018, the Court granted the motion to stay and denied the motion to enjoin.
Pre-arbitration mediation proceedings took place on October 4 and 5, 2018, and the claims of all 16 arbitration claimants were resolved.
Between November 2018 and February 2019, an additional 150 individuals filed consents to opt‐in to the action as party‐plaintiffs, many of whom signed separation agreements that include class waivers and mandatory arbitration provisions.
The addition of these opt-ins brings the total number of plaintiffs to 189.
The stay of the litigation remains in place.
Jackson, et al.
v. HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
This putative nationwide class action was filed on July 24, 2017 in federal district court in San Jose, California.
The plaintiffs purport to bring the lawsuit on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated African-Americans and individuals over the age of forty.
The plaintiffs allege that the defendants engaged in a pattern and practice of racial and age discrimination in lay-offs and promotions.
The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on September 29, 2017.
On January 12, 2018, the defendants moved to transfer the matter to the federal district court in the Northern District of Georgia.
The defendants also moved to dismiss the claims on various grounds and to strike certain aspects of the proposed class definition.
The Court dismissed the action on the basis of improper venue.
On July 23, 2018, the plaintiffs refiled the case in the Northern District of Georgia.
On August 9, 2018, the plaintiffs also filed a notice of appeal of the dismissal order with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
On October 1, 2018, the Georgia court granted the plaintiffs’ unopposed motion to stay and administratively close the Georgia action until the Ninth Circuit appeal is decided.
India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Proceedings.
On April 30 and May 10, 2010, the India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (the “DRI”) issued show cause notices to Hewlett-Packard India Sales Private Limited (“HP India”), a subsidiary of HP, seven HP India employees and one former HP India employee alleging that HP India underpaid customs duties while importing products and spare parts into India and seeking to recover an aggregate of approximately $370 million, plus penalties.
Prior to the issuance of the show cause notices, HP India deposited approximately $16 million with the DRI and agreed to post a provisional bond in exchange for the DRI’s agreement to not seize HP India products and spare parts and to not interrupt the transaction of business by HP India.
On April 11, 2012, the Bangalore Commissioner of Customs issued an order on the products-related show cause notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HP India and the named individuals of approximately $386 million, of which HP India had already deposited $9 million.
On December 11, 2012, HP India voluntarily deposited an additional $10 million in connection with the products-related show cause notice.
The differential duty demand is subject to interest.
After the order, HP India deposited an additional $3 million in connection with the parts-related show cause notice so as to avoid certain penalties.
HP India filed appeals of the Commissioner’s orders before the Customs Tribunal along with applications for waiver of the pre-deposit of remaining demand amounts as a condition for hearing the appeals.
The Customs Department has also filed cross-appeals before the Customs Tribunal.
On January 24, 2013, the Customs Tribunal ordered HP India to deposit an additional $24 million against the products order, which HP India deposited in March 2013.
The Customs Tribunal did not order any additional deposit to be made under the parts order.
In December 2013, HP India filed applications before the Customs Tribunal seeking early hearing of the appeals as well as an extension of the stay of deposit as to HP India and the individuals already granted until final disposition of the appeals.
On February 7, 2014, the application for extension of the stay of deposit was granted by the Customs Tribunal until disposal of the appeals.
On October 27, 2014, the Customs Tribunal commenced hearings on the cross-appeals of the Commissioner’s orders.
The Customs Tribunal rejected HP India’s request to remand the matter to the Commissioner on procedural grounds.
The hearings scheduled to reconvene on April 6, 2015 and again on November 3, 2015 and April 11, 2016 were canceled at the request of the Customs Tribunal.
A hearing on the merits of the appeal scheduled for January 15, 2019 has been cancelled.
Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has agreed to indemnify HP in part, based on the extent to which any liability arises from the products and spare parts of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s businesses.

; (9) violations of the California Computer Data Access and Fraud Act, Cal.
On February 7, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to certify an injunctive relief class of “[a]ll persons in California who own a Class Printer” under the “unfair” prong of the California unfair competition statute and a class of “[a]ll persons in the United States who purchased a Class Printer and experienced a print failure while using a non-HP aftermarket cartridge during the period between March 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017” under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and common law trespass to chattels.
On March 29, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part HP’s motion to dismiss.
The court also dismissed in part the plaintiffs’ fraud-based claims under the California consumer protection statutes and computer hacking claims under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and California Computer Data Access and Fraud Act.
On September 18, 2018, the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release pursuant to which the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss all claims against HP in exchange for a $1.5 million payment to the class and an agreement that HP would not reinstall the authentication protocol on the printers at issue.
The settlement is subject to the approval of the court.
The plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement, which was granted by the court on November 19, 2018.
Notice of the settlement was given to the class beginning on January 7, 2019, and class members will have 120 days in which to opt out of or object to the settlement.
A final approval hearing is scheduled for April 25, 2019.
Autonomy-Related Legal Matters



Investigations.
On January 19, 2015, the U.K. Serious Fraud Office notified HP that it was closing its investigation and had decided to cede jurisdiction of the investigation to the U.S. authorities.
On November 14, 2016, the DOJ announced that a federal grand jury indicted Sushovan Hussain, the former CFO of Autonomy.
Mr. Hussain was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, securities fraud, and multiple counts of wire fraud.
A jury trial commenced on February 26, 2018.
On April 30, 2018, the jury found Mr. Hussain guilty of all charges against him.
On November 15, 2016, the SEC announced that Stouffer Egan, the former CEO of Autonomy’s U.S.-based operations, settled charges relating to his participation in an accounting scheme to meet internal sales targets and analyst revenue expectations.
On November 29, 2018, the DOJ announced that a federal grand jury indicted Michael Lynch, former CEO of Autonomy, and Stephen Chamberlain, former VP of Finance of Autonomy.
Dr. Lynch and Mr. Chamberlain were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and multiple counts of wire fraud.
HP is continuing to cooperate with the ongoing enforcement actions.

Autonomy Corporation Limited v. Michael Lynch and Sushovan Hussain.
On April 17, 2015, four former-HP subsidiaries that became subsidiaries of Hewlett Packard Enterprise at the time of the Separation (Autonomy Corporation Limited, Hewlett Packard Vision BV, Autonomy Systems, Limited, and Autonomy, Inc.) initiated civil proceedings in the U.K. High Court of Justice against two members of Autonomy’s former management, Michael Lynch and Sushovan Hussain.
On October 1, 2015, Messrs. Lynch and Hussain filed their defenses.
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise subsidiary claimants filed their replies to the defenses and the asserted counter-claim on March 11, 2016.
The parties are actively engaged in the disclosure process.
A six-month trial is scheduled to begin on March 25, 2019.
Environmental



HP’s operations and products are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the content of HP’s products and the recycling, treatment and disposal of those products.
The amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.
HP is also conducting environmental investigations or remediations at several current or former operating sites pursuant to administrative orders or consent agreements with state environmental agencies.
The separation and distribution agreement includes provisions that provide for the allocation of environmental liabilities between HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise including certain remediation obligations; responsibilities arising from the chemical and materials composition of their respective products, their safe use and their energy consumption; obligations under product take back legislation that addresses the collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of products; and other environmental matters.
HP will generally be responsible for environmental liabilities related to the properties and other assets, including products, allocated to HP under the separation and distribution agreement and other ancillary agreements.
In addition, HP will share with Hewlett Packard Enterprise other environmental liabilities as set forth in the separation and distribution agreement.
HP is indemnified in whole or in part by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for liabilities arising from the assets assigned to Hewlett Packard Enterprise and for certain environmental matters as detailed in the separation and distribution agreement.
In general, HP would be obligated to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event a specified triggering event occurs as defined by the guarantee.
HP believes the likelihood of having to perform under a material guarantee is remote.
Cross-Indemnifications with Hewlett Packard Enterprise



Under the separation and distribution agreement, HP agreed to indemnify Hewlett Packard Enterprise, each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out

of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to HP as part of the Separation.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise similarly agreed to indemnify HP, each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to Hewlett Packard Enterprise as part of the Separation.
HP expects Hewlett Packard Enterprise to fully perform under the terms of the separation and distribution agreement.
For information on cross-indemnifications with Hewlett Packard Enterprise for litigation matters, see Note 12, “Litigation and Contingencies.”



In connection with the Separation, HP entered into the tax matters agreement (“TMA”) with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, effective on November 1, 2015.
The TMA provides that HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise will share certain pre-Separation income tax liabilities.
In addition, if the distribution of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s common shares to the HP stockholders is determined to be taxable, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP would share the tax liability equally, unless the taxability of the distribution is the direct result of action taken by either Hewlett Packard Enterprise or HP subsequent to the distribution, in which case the party causing the distribution to be taxable would be responsible for any taxes imposed on the distribution.
Indemnifications 



In the ordinary course of business, HP enters into contractual arrangements under which HP may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of HP or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance.
The net receivable as of January 31, 2019 was $0.9 billion.
Warranties



HP accrues the estimated cost of product warranties at the time it recognizes revenue.
HP’s aggregate product warranty liabilities and changes were as follows:

Note 14: Acquisitions



On November 1, 2018, HP completed the acquisition of the Apogee group.
This acquisition furthers HP’s plan to disrupt the A3 copier market and builds on its printing strategy to enhance its A3 and A4 product portfolio; build differentiated solutions and tools to expand its MPS; and invest in its direct and indirect go-to-market capabilities.
Apogee augments HP’s services portfolio in contractual office printing and MPS, where solutions are increasingly important for SMBs.
HP reports the financial results of the above business in the Printing segment.
The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair values of certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, the valuation of intangible assets acquired and residual goodwill.
HP expects to continue to obtain information to assist it in determining the fair value of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date during the measurement period.
