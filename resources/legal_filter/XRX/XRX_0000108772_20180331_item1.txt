Fuji Xerox is a joint venture between Xerox Corporation and Fujifilm Holdings Corporation (“Fujifilm”) in which Xerox holds a noncontrolling 25% equity interest and Fujifilm holds the remaining equity interest. In 2017 Fujifilm publicly announced it had formed an independent investigation committee ("IIC") to conduct a review of the appropriateness of the accounting practices at Fuji Xerox’s New Zealand subsidiary related to the recovery of receivables associated with certain bundled leasing transactions that occurred in, or prior to, Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year ending March 31, 2016.

With respect to fair value, we perform an analysis of equipment fair value based on cash selling prices during the applicable period. The cash selling prices are compared to the range of values determined for our leases. The range of cash selling prices must be reasonably consistent with the lease selling prices in order for us to determine that such lease prices are indicative of fair value.

Other Revenue Recognition Policies
In the first quarter 2018, incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract of $17 were deferred and amortization was $24. The balance of deferred incremental direct costs net of accumulated amortization at March 31, 2018 was $179. This amount is expected to be amortized over its estimated period of benefit, which we currently estimate to be approximately four years.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This update requires the recognition of leased assets and lease obligations by lessees for those leases currently classified as operating leases under existing lease guidance. Short term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not required to be recognized. The update also requires disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements to increase transparency and comparability among organizations. The accounting for lessors does not fundamentally change except for changes to conform and align guidance to the lessee guidance as well as to the new revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. The aggregate undiscounted value of our operating lease commitments at December 31, 2017 was approximately $450 and was primarily related to leases of facilities.

Interest Rate Risk Management
We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure and to achieve a desired proportion of variable and fixed rate debt. These derivatives may be designated as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges depending on the nature of the risk being hedged.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
•Forecasted purchases and sales in foreign currency
At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had outstanding forward exchange and purchased option contracts with gross notional values of $1,557 and $1,788 respectively, with terms of less than 12 months. Approximately 70% of the contracts at March 31, 2018 mature within three months, 20% mature in three to six months and 10% in six to twelve months. The associated currency exposures being hedged at March 31, 2018 were materially consistent with our year-end currency exposures. There has not been any material change in our hedging strategy.

Non-designated derivative instruments are primarily instruments used to hedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. They are not designated as hedges since there is a natural offset for the re-measurement of the underlying foreign currency-denominated asset or liability.

Note 14 – Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities
Fair value for our deferred compensation plan investments in mutual funds is based on quoted market prices for those funds. Fair value for deferred compensation plan liabilities is based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment selections.
Summary of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities 
The fair value amounts for Cash and cash equivalents and Accounts receivable, net, approximate carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair value of Short and Long-term debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to us for debt of similar maturities (Level 2). The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at such date.

Litigation Against the Company
Another complaint filed by Darwin Deason, a Xerox shareholder, against Xerox and its directors in the same Court on March 2, 2018 alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by refusing Mr. Deason’s request for a waiver of the deadline for nomination of a new slate of Xerox directors, and seeks to enjoin Xerox and its directors from 
Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q
Table of Contents 
enforcing Xerox’s advance notice by-laws, thereby allowing Mr. Deason to proceed with the nominations, as well as costs, fees, and other relief. 
On April 27, 2018, the Court issued decisions and orders granting plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions, which (i) enjoin Xerox from “taking any further action to consummate the change of control transaction between Xerox and Fuji that was announced on January 31, 2018 pending a final determination of the claims asserted in the underlying action;” (ii) enjoin Xerox from enforcing its advance notice bylaw provision requiring shareholders to nominate directors for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting by December 11, 2017; and (iii) require Xerox to waive such advance notice bylaw provision to permit the noticing of a slate of director nominees for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting, and denying defendants’ motions to dismiss. 
On May 1, 2018, Xerox entered into a Director Appointment, Nomination and Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, among others, that would have resolved the pending proxy contest in connection with Xerox’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, as well as the ongoing litigation brought by Mr. Deason against Xerox and its directors related to the proposed Fuji Transaction. The agreement expired by its terms on May 3, 2018 without becoming effective. 
On May 7, 2018, defendants filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department, notices of appeal of, and motions to stay pending appeal, the lower Court’s decision and order. Defendants also moved the appellate court for interim relief ordering that the appeal be heard on an expedited basis. At a hearing before the appellate court on May 7, 2018, the appellate court ruled that the appeals would be heard on an expedited basis and granted a partial interim stay allowing Xerox and Fujifilm to take steps to seek regulatory approvals related to the Fuji Transaction pending a ruling from the appellate court on defendants’ motions to stay pending appeal.

Fuji Xerox Transaction Overview
•Redemption and Issuance - Fuji Xerox will redeem most of the shares of Fuji Xerox owned by Fujifilm in exchange for cash. Immediately following the Redemption, Fujifilm will contribute to Xerox the cash it received in the Redemption and all shares of Fuji Xerox still held by Fujifilm after giving effect to the Redemption and, in exchange therefore, Xerox will issue to Fujifilm a number of shares of Xerox common stock such that Fujifilm will own 50.1% of the Xerox common stock, on a fully diluted basis, at the closing of the transactions (the “Closing”), a portion of which will be held in escrow in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Agreements. As a result of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements (referred to herein as the "combination"), Fuji Xerox will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox and Xerox will become a direct, majority owned subsidiary of Fujifilm (with the remainder of Xerox continuing to be owned by Xerox’s existing shareholders). The escrowed shares will be released from escrow upon, among other things, (i) the conversion of any shares of Xerox Series B Convertible

As previously announced, the Company and Fujifilm have been in discussions about improving the terms of their announced transaction. In connection with such discussions, the Company has had correspondence with Fujifilm as to whether Xerox has the right to terminate the Subscription Agreement.
Fuji Xerox has been determined to be the accounting acquirer and Xerox to be the accounting acquiree under the acquisition method of accounting based on various considerations. As noted above, immediately following the Closing, Fujifilm, the former parent of Fuji Xerox, is expected to own approximately 50.1% of the fully diluted capital stock of new Fuji Xerox and the other Xerox shareholders are expected to own approximately 49.9%. Further, pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, to be entered into by Xerox and Fujifilm at Closing (the “Shareholders Agreement”), the board of directors of new Fuji Xerox will have twelve directors, which will initially be composed of seven individuals designated by Fujifilm (including the current CEO of Xerox) and five individuals from among the members of the board of directors of Xerox immediately prior to Closing designated by Xerox in consultation with and subject to reasonable approval by Fujifilm. Accordingly, the combination is expected to be accounted for as a reverse acquisition as per ASC Topic 805-40 "Business Combinations - Reverse Acquisitions".
The completion of the Fujifilm Transactions will require Xerox shareholder approval as well as customary regulatory approvals, filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, tax considerations, and securing any necessary financing. Until the combination is complete, each of Xerox, Fuji Xerox and Fujifilm will continue to be separate, independent organizations and will operate as usual.
On January 31, 2018, Xerox entered into a Commitment Letter with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., which provides a commitment, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, for a $2.5 billion unsecured bridge loan facility. This facility would be available for Xerox to pay the special one-time cash dividend of $2.5 billion to existing shareholders of Xerox as described herein. Xerox has not borrowed funds nor does it currently plan to borrow funds from this facility, rather, prior to closing, Xerox intends to secure alternative financing to meet its obligation to pay the special dividend. At March 31, 2018, we had approximately $11 of debt issuance costs deferred in connection with this facility, which are currently being amortized over the remainder of the year, and another $6 was paid in the second quarter 2018, which will also be deferred and amortized. Xerox may also secure financing to fund approximately $350 required to settle certain of Xerox's obligations in respect of unfunded supplemental pension plans and deferred compensation plans which will accelerate in connection with the combination (such accelerated payments, the "change-in-control payments").
