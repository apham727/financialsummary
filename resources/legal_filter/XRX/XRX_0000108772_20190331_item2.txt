Currency Impact
To understand the trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars on revenue and expenses. We refer to this analysis as "constant currency", “currency impact” or “the impact from currency.” This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate. This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
Overview
Cash flows provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $226 million, as compared to $216 million in first quarter 2018. The increase reflects improved cash flow from earnings and lower restructuring payments, which were partially offset by a use of cash for working capital2 and accrued compensation. Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $18 million including capital expenditures of $15

Summary of Key Financial Ratios
Pre-tax Income Margin
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
Selling, Administrative and General Expenses (SAG)
SAG of $548 million was $80 million lower than first quarter 2018, reflecting productivity and restructuring savings associated with our Project Own It transformation actions as well as favorable impacts of approximately $13 million from translation currency and $9 million from a prior year accelerated depreciation charge. Bad debt expense of $13 million was flat as compared to first quarter 2018 and on a trailing twelve month basis (TTM) remained at less than one percent of total receivables.
Restructuring and Related Costs
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
The restructuring reserve balance as of March 31, 2019 for all programs was $80 million, of which $74 million is expected to be spent over the next twelve months.
Refer to Note 11 - Restructuring Programs in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring programs.
Transaction and Related Costs, Net
Amortization of intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2019 of $15 million increased by $3 million as compared to first quarter 2018.

Worldwide Employment
Other Expenses, Net
Non-financing interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2019 of $27 million was $2 million lower than first quarter 2018. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $4 million from first quarter 2018 primarily due to a lower debt balance.
Non-service retirement-related costs for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $12 million lower than first quarter 2018, primarily driven by the favorable impact of a 2018 amendment to our U.S. Retiree Health Plan partially offset by higher losses from pension settlements in the U.S.
Refer to Note 15 - Employee Benefit Plans in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding non-service retirement-related costs.
Gains on Sales of Businesses and Assets
Gains on sales of businesses and assets for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $15 million lower than first quarter 2018, reflecting the prior year sale of non-core business assets.

For the three months ended March 31, 2019, equity income increased $113 million as compared to the first quarter 2018, primarily reflecting $67 million of lower year-over-year charges related to our share of Fuji Xerox after-tax restructuring and other changes as well as an approximate $28 million charge related to an out-of-period charge at Fuji Xerox in the prior year. The increase also reflects savings from restructuring.

Other Comprehensive Income
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $786 million and $1,148 million, respectively. There were no borrowings under our Credit Facility at March 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018, respectively. The decrease in total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash primarily reflect the repayment of $406 million of maturing Senior Notes in first quarter 2019.
We continue to expect operating cash flows from continuing operations to be between $1,150 million and $1,250 million in 2019. Additionally, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $150 million and dividend payments to shareholders of approximately $250 million. We have increased our full year 2019 expected share repurchases to be at least $600 million, from our original expectation of at least $300 million. The incremental repurchases will be weighted to the latter half of 2019. 
•$37 million increase primarily due to lower levels of non-equipment inventories.

•$23 million increase primarily related to the prior year settlements of foreign derivative contracts.
•$21 million increase from lower restructuring payments.
•$41 million decrease from accrued compensation primarily related to the year-over-year timing of employee incentive compensation payments.

Net cash used in investing activities was $18 million in first quarter 2019. The $16 million change in cash was primarily due to the sale of non-core business assets in 2018.
