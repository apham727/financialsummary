Currency Impact
To understand the trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars on revenue and expenses. We refer to this analysis as "constant currency", “currency impact” or “the impact from currency.” This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate. This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
Overview
Second Quarter 2019 Review 
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
Cash flows provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were $539 million, as compared to $451 million in the prior year period primarily reflecting increased dividends from equity investments and lower cash payments for Transaction and related costs. These benefits were partially offset by higher payments for restructuring related costs and a use of cash for working capital2. Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $72 million including capital expenditures of $31 million and acquisitions of $42 million. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $846 million reflecting payments of $406 million on Senior Notes, $300 million for share repurchases and dividend payments of $122 million.

Installs reflect new placement of devices only. Revenue associated with equipment installations may be reflected up-front in Equipment sales or over time either through rental income or as part of our Xerox Services revenues (which are both reported within our post sale revenues), depending on the terms and conditions of our agreements with customers. Installs include activity from Xerox Services and Xerox-branded products shipped to our XBS sales unit. Detail by product group (see Geographic Sales Channels and Product and Offerings Definitions) is shown below.

Summary of Key Financial Ratios
Pre-tax Income Margin
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
Selling, Administrative and General Expenses (SAG)
SAG of $519 million decreased $105 million as compared to second quarter 2018, reflecting productivity and restructuring savings associated with our Project Own It transformation actions as well as favorable impacts of approximately $9 million from translation currency and $20 million from higher costs in the prior year related to the termination of an IT project and the accelerated depreciation associated with the exit of a surplus real estate facility. Bad debt expense of $12 million was flat as compared to second quarter 2018 and on a trailing twelve month basis (TTM) remained at less than one percent of total receivables.
SAG as a percentage of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 of 23.7% decreased by 1.6-percentage points as compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting the benefit from productivity and restructuring associated with our Project Own It transformation actions. 
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q

The restructuring reserve balance as of June 30, 2019 for all programs was $69 million, of which $67 million is expected to be spent over the next twelve months.
Refer to Note 12 - Restructuring Programs in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring programs.
Transaction and Related Costs, Net
Worldwide Employment
Worldwide employment was approximately 27,900 as of June 30, 2019 and decreased by approximately 4,500 from December 31, 2018. The reduction resulted from net attrition (attrition net of gross hires), of which a large portion is not expected to be backfilled, as well as the impact of organizational changes including employees transferred as part of the shared services arrangement recently entered into with HCL Technologies.
Other Expenses, Net
Second quarter non-financing interest expense of $26 million was $1 million lower than second quarter 2018. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $1 million from second quarter 2018 primarily due to a lower debt balance.
Non-financing interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 of $53 million was $3 million lower than the prior year period. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $5 million from the prior year period primarily due to a lower debt balance.
Non-Service Retirement-Related Costs
Non-service retirement-related costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased $15 million and $27 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, primarily driven by the favorable impact of a 2018 amendment to our U.S. Retiree Health Plan partially offset by higher losses from pension settlements in the U.S.
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
Refer to Note 16 - Employee Benefit Plans in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding non-service retirement-related costs.
Gains on Sales of Businesses and Assets
Gains on sales of businesses and assets for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased by $16 million and $31 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, reflecting the prior year sale of non-core business assets.
Equity in Net Income (Loss) of Unconsolidated Affiliates
Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates primarily reflects our 25% share of Fuji Xerox Net income (loss). For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, equity income increased $15 million and $128 million as compared to the prior year periods, primarily reflecting savings from restructuring. The increase in Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates for the six months ended June 30, 2019 also reflects $64 million of lower year-over-year charges of related to our share of Fuji Xerox after-tax restructuring and other charges, as well as an approximate $28 million charge related to an out-of-period charge at Fuji Xerox in the prior year.
