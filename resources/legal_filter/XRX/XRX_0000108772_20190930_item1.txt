Corporate Reorganization
On March 6, 2019, the Xerox Board of Directors approved a reorganization (the “Reorganization”) of the Company's corporate structure into a holding company structure. The Reorganization was subject to the approval of shareholders, which was obtained at the annual shareholders meeting held May 21, 2019.
On July 31, 2019, Xerox completed the Reorganization, pursuant to which Xerox became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox Holdings. The business operations, directors and executive officers of the Company did not change as a result of the Reorganization.
The Reorganization was accounted for as a transaction among entities under common control and is expected to be a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Shares of Xerox Holdings common stock trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “XRX”, formerly used by Xerox. 
Subsequent to the Reorganization, Xerox Holdings contributed the Xerox Series B Preferred Stock it held to Xerox in exchange for additional capital and Xerox subsequently extinguished the Series B Preferred Stock. The contribution and extinguishment were recorded at carrying value. In addition, the capital structure of Xerox was modified such that

Shared Services Arrangement with HCL Technologies
In March 2019, as part of Project Own It, we entered into a shared services arrangement with HCL Technologies (HCL) pursuant to which we are outsourcing certain global administrative and support functions, including, among others, selected information technology and finance functions (excluding accounting). The transition of these functions to HCL is expected to take up to 18 months. HCL is expected to make certain up-front and ongoing investments in software, tools and other technology to consolidate, optimize and automate the transferred functions with the goal of providing improved service levels and significant cost savings. The shared services arrangement with HCL includes a total aggregate spending commitment by us of approximately $1.3 billion over the next 7 years. However, we can terminate the arrangement at any time at our discretion, subject to payment of termination fees that decline over the term or for cause. The spending commitment excludes restructuring and related costs we are expected to incur in connection with the transition of the contemplated functions - refer to Note 12 - Restructuring Programs for additional information. The transfer of employees associated with the HCL arrangement in certain countries is subject to compliance with works council and other employment regulatory requirements in those countries, which may delay the transfer as well as the expected savings from the arrangement. 
Change in Presentation
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
Intangibles - Internal-Use Software 
On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC Topic 842). This update, as well as additional amendments and targeted improvements issued in 2018 and early 2019, supersedes existing lease accounting guidance found under ASC 840, Leases (“ASC 840”) and requires the recognition of right-to-use assets and lease obligations by lessees for those leases originally classified as operating leases under prior lease guidance. Effective with the adoption, leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. Short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not required to be recognized. The update also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosure of key information regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements to increase transparency and comparability among companies. The accounting for lessors does not fundamentally change with this update except for changes to conform and align guidance to the lessee guidance, as well as to the revenue recognition guidance in ASU 2014-09. Some of these conforming changes, such as those related to the definition of lease term and minimum lease payments, resulted in certain lease arrangements, that would have been previously accounted for as operating leases, to be classified and accounted for as sales-type leases with a corresponding up-front recognition of equipment sales revenue. 
Upon adoption, we applied the transition option, whereby prior comparative periods are not retrospectively presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We also elected the package of practical expedients not to reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs and the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for certain asset classes (real estate lease arrangements for offices and warehouses). Additionally, we made a policy election to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases for all asset classes. We elected the package of practical expedients from both the Lessee and Lessor prospective, to the extent applicable. 
Lessee accounting - the adoption of this update resulted in an increase to assets and related liabilities of approximately $385 (approximately $440 undiscounted) primarily related to leases of facilities. Lessor accounting - the adoption of 
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
this update resulted in an increase to equipment sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 of approximately $9 and $20, respectively, in 2019 as compared to the prior year periods. 
Refer to Note 3 - Adoption of New Leasing Standard - Lessee and Note 4 - Adoption of New Leasing Standard - Lessor for additional transitional disclosures related to the adoption of this standard.

Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since the implicit rate for most of our leases is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments, in a similar economic environment and over a similar term. The rate is dependent on several factors, including the lease term and currency of the lease payments.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. These components are accounted for separately for vehicle and equipment leases. We account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for real estate leases of offices and warehouses. 
Operating Leases
As of September 30, 2019, we have an additional real estate operating lease that has not yet commenced. This operating lease has an obligation and corresponding ROU asset of $23 and will commence in December 2019 with a lease term of approximately 10 years.

Represents the future minimum operating lease payments expected to be made over the remaining balance of the year.
Xerox has one finance lease for equipment and related infrastructure within an outsourced warehouse supply arrangement in the U.S. The lease expires in December 2023 and has a remaining lease obligation of $7 as of September 30, 2019 based on a discount rate of 4.07%. The Right-of-use asset balance associated with this finance lease of $7 is included in Land, buildings and equipment, net in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, operating lease expense, net of sublease income, were $147 and $161, respectively.

The balance of deferred incremental direct costs net of accumulated amortization at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $162 and $172, respectively. This amount is expected to be amortized over its estimated period of benefit, which we currently estimate to be approximately four years. 
Xerox is focused on increasing its Small and Mid-sized (SMB) coverage through resellers and partners (including multi-brand dealers) and continued distribution acquisitions. During the second quarter of 2019, acquisitions totaled $38 and included Rabbit Copiers, Inc. (Rabbit Office Automation (ROA)), a San Francisco Bay area dealer, and Heritage Business Systems, Inc. (HBS), a Delaware Valley dealer. Both dealers expand our distribution and increase the number of resources in these geographies and provide office technology sales, services and supplies in those markets.

Interest Rate Risk Management
We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure and to achieve a desired proportion of variable and fixed rate debt. These derivatives may be designated as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges depending on the nature of the risk being hedged.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
•Forecasted purchases and sales in foreign currency
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had outstanding forward exchange and purchased option contracts with gross notional values of $982 and $1,103 respectively, with terms of less than 12 months. Approximately 80% of the contracts at September 30, 2019 mature within three months, 10% mature in three to six months and 10% in six to twelve months. The associated currency exposures being hedged at September 30, 2019 were materially consistent with our year-end currency exposures. There has not been any material change in our hedging strategy.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 currency losses, net were $4 and $6, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $3 and $2, respectively. Net currency gains and losses include the mark-to-market adjustments of the derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and the related cost of those derivatives as well as the remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and are included in Other expenses, net.
Note 15 – Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities
Fair value for our deferred compensation plan investments in mutual funds is based on quoted market prices for those funds. Fair value for deferred compensation plan liabilities is based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment selections.
Summary of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities 
The fair value amounts for Cash and cash equivalents and Accounts receivable, net, approximate carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair value of Short-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, and Long-term debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to us for debt of similar maturities (Level 2). The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at such date.

Legal Matters
In February 2018, five complaints (the "Fuji Transaction Shareholder Lawsuits"), including four putative class actions (which have been consolidated), were filed by Xerox shareholders in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the "Court") in connection with the proposed transaction to combine Xerox and Fuji Xerox (the “Fuji Transaction”). All of the complaints name as defendants Xerox, its directors, and FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation (“Fujifilm”). The complaint in one of the actions also names as a defendant Ursula M. Burns, the former Chief Executive Officer of Xerox. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that Xerox's directors breached their fiduciary duties in negotiating, approving, and purportedly making false and misleading disclosures about the Fuji Transaction, and that Fujifilm aided and abetted those breaches. The complaint in one of the actions further alleges that Xerox and the director defendants engaged in common law fraud by purportedly failing to disclose information about the joint venture agreements between Xerox and Fujifilm. The Fuji Transaction Shareholder Lawsuits seek injunctive relief preventing 
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
On April 27, 2018, the Court issued decisions and orders granting plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions, which (i) enjoined Xerox from “taking any further action to consummate the change of control transaction between Xerox and Fuji that was announced on January 31, 2018 pending a final determination of the claims asserted in the underlying action;” (ii) enjoined Xerox from enforcing its advance notice bylaw provision requiring shareholders to nominate directors for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting by December 11, 2017; and (iii) required Xerox to waive such advance notice bylaw provision to permit the noticing of a slate of director nominees for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting, and denying defendants’ motions to dismiss.
On May 1, 2018, Xerox entered into a Director Appointment, Nomination and Settlement Agreement (the “Initial Settlement Agreement”) with Mr. Deason and Carl C. Icahn and certain of his affiliates who were also Xerox shareholders (the "Icahn Group"), among others, that would have resolved Deason I, Deason II and the pending proxy contest in connection with Xerox’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Initial Settlement Agreement expired by its terms on May 3, 2018 without becoming effective.
On May 7, 2018, defendants filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department, notices of appeal of, and motions to stay pending appeal, the lower Court’s decision and order. Defendants also moved the appellate court for interim relief ordering that the appeal be heard on an expedited basis. At a hearing before the appellate court on May 7, 2018, the appellate court ruled that the appeals would be heard on an expedited basis and granted a partial interim stay allowing Xerox and Fujifilm to take steps to seek regulatory approvals related to the Fuji Transaction pending a ruling from the appellate court on defendants’ motions to stay pending appeal.
On May 13, 2018, a second Director Appointment, Nomination and Settlement Agreement (the "Final Settlement Agreement") with respect to Deason I, Deason II and the pending proxy contest in connection with Xerox's 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders that was initiated by the Icahn Group was signed on behalf of Mr. Deason, the Icahn Group and all defendants except Fujifilm, and a memorandum of understanding regarding settlement of the putative class case was signed by all defendants except Fujifilm. Pursuant to the settlements, the settling defendants withdrew their appeal and motion to stay in Deason I and Deason II. The settling defendants also withdrew their motion to stay in the putative class case. The Court entered a stipulation of discontinuance as to the settling parties in Deason II on May 14, 2018, and agreed on June 22, 2018 to do the same in Deason I. 
On June 22, 2018, the Court entered an order denying a joint motion by the putative class plaintiffs and the settling defendants to dissolve the injunction in the putative class case as against the settling defendants, and entered an order denying Fujifilm’s motion to dissolve the injunctions in the putative class case and Deason I in their entirety.
On July 16, 2018, the Court held a hearing concerning the putative class plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval of the settlement in the putative class case. The Court indicated that it was not inclined to consider motions for approval of the settlement prior to considering whether the putative class should be certified.
On August 2, 2018, the Appellate Division entered orders recognizing the Xerox defendants’ withdrawal of their appeal in the Deason cases and denying all appellants’ motions to stay pending determination of appeals in the Deason and putative class cases.
On August 2, 2018, the Appellate Division entered orders (i) at their request, deeming withdrawn the Xerox defendants’ appeal and motion to stay in the Deason cases; (ii) upon their request, deeming withdrawn the Xerox defendants’

On September 21, 2018, putative class plaintiffs filed a motion for certification of a settlement class and a motion to transmit notice of the proposed settlement to the proposed class. On October 17, 2018, derivative plaintiff Carmen Ribbe and Fujifilm filed oppositions to the putative class plaintiffs’ motion to transmit notice to the proposed class. The class has not yet been certified, and preliminary approval has not been granted.
The Appellate Division heard oral argument on September 25, 2018 on Fujifilm’s appeal of the Court’s decision. On October 16, 2018, the Appellate Division entered a decision and order reversing the Court’s rulings, ordering that the claims brought against Fujifilm in the cases by Mr. Deason and the purported class be dismissed, and further ordering that the preliminary injunction of the proposed Fuji Transaction be dissolved (the “Appellate Decision and Order”).
On November 15, 2018, the putative class plaintiffs filed with the Appellate Division a motion seeking the opportunity to reargue Fujifilm’s appeal or, in the alternative, for leave to appeal the Appellate Decision and Order to the New York State Court of Appeals.
On December 6, 2018, pursuant to the Appellate Decision and Order, the Court entered a judgment dismissing the complaints against Fujifilm in Deason I and the putative class case. The Court further issued orders denying the putative class plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, without prejudice to renewing the motion after the outcome of any appeals of the Appellate Decision and Order. 
On January 8, 2019, the Court entered an order staying all further proceedings in Deason I and the putative class case until thirty days after exhaustion of appeals, including any appeals to the New York State Court of Appeals, of the Appellate Decision and Order. On January 9, 2019, the Court entered an order denying the putative class plaintiffs’ motion to transmit notice to the proposed class, without prejudice to renewal of their motion at a later time.
On October 31, 2018 and January 3, 2019, respectively, Xerox and the Xerox director defendants in the putative class case filed with the Appellate Division a request and motion seeking an extension, until after any decision regarding approval of settlement of the putative class action, of the deadline by which to perfect their appeal of the Court’s April 27, 2018 decision and order. On May 16, 2019, the Appellate Division entered an order granting the motion and extended the deadline until the October 2019 Term.
On February 21, 2019, the Appellate Division issued an order denying the putative class plaintiffs’ motion seeking to reargue Fujifilm’s appeal or, in the alternative, for leave to appeal the Appellate Decision and Order to the New York State Court of Appeals. No further notice of appeal was filed, and the Appellate Decision and Order became final and unappealable on March 26, 2019.
On May 3, 2019, putative class plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for approval of the form of a notice to putative class members. On May 6, 2019, putative class plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification and notice of motion to approve class settlement and proposed final approval order. On May 24, 2019, the Court entered an order approving the form notice and proposed manner of its dissemination.
On June 6, 2019, the Court entered an order pursuant to which plaintiffs submitted their motion to approve attorneys’ fees and expenses on July 19, 2019; requiring filing of any objections to or opt-outs from the proposed putative class settlement by August 9, 2019; and setting September 6, 2019 for its hearing on putative class plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and settlement approval. The hearing took place, and on September 12, 2019, the Court entered a decision and order denying both motions.
On April 11, 2019, Carmen Ribbe filed a putative derivative and class action stockholder complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for New York County, naming as defendants Xerox, current Board members Gregory Q. Brown, Joseph J. Echevarria, Cheryl Gordon Krongard, Sara Martinez Tucker, Keith Cozza, Giovanni G. Visentin, Jonathan Christodoro, Nicholas Graziano, and A. Scott Letier, and former Board members Jeffrey Jacobson, William Curt Hunter, Robert J. Keegan, Charles Prince, Ann N. Reese, and Stephen H. Rusckowski. Plaintiff previously filed a putative shareholder derivative lawsuit on May 24, 2018 against certain of these defendants, as well as others, in the same court; that lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice on December 6, 2018. The new complaint includes 
Xerox 2019 Form 10-Q
Defendants accepted service of the complaint as of May 16, 2019. On June 4, 2019, the Court entered an order setting a briefing schedule for defendants’ motions to dismiss the complaint. On July 12, 2019, plaintiff filed a motion to preclude defendants from referencing in their motions to dismiss the formation of, or work by, the committee of the Board established to investigate plaintiff’s shareholder demand. On July 18, 2019, the Court denied plaintiff’s motion and adjourned sine die the deadline by which defendants must file any motions to dismiss the complaint. 
At a conference on September 24, 2018, the Court stayed all discovery pending resolution of Xerox’s motion to dismiss. Xerox filed its motion to dismiss on October 1, 2018. On February 22, 2019, following oral argument, the Court denied the motion to dismiss.

On May 9, 2014, the State of Texas, via the Texas Office of Attorney General (the “State”), filed a lawsuit in the 53rd Judicial District Court of Travis County, Texas. The lawsuit alleged that Xerox Corporation, Xerox State Healthcare, LLC and ACS State Healthcare (collectively “the Defendants”) violated the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act in the administration of ACS State Healthcare’s contract with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services (“HHSC”). Xerox Corporation provided a guaranty of contractual performance with respect to the ACS State Healthcare contract. The State alleged that the Defendants made false representations of material facts regarding the processes, procedures, implementation and results regarding the prior authorization of orthodontic claims. The State sought recovery of actual damages, two times the amount of any overpayments made as a result of alleged unlawful acts, civil penalties, pre- and post-judgment interest and all costs and attorneys’ fees. The State referenced the amount in controversy as exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars. The Defendants filed their Answer in June 2014 denying all allegations. In August 2017, the State of Texas filed a Second Amended Petition, which made substantially similar allegations and sought similar remedies as the original lawsuit. On October 23, 2017, Xerox Corporation filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking judgment in Xerox's favor on all claims against it. On July 2, 2018, the Court denied the State of Texas’ motion for a determination of the adequacy of its pleadings as to Xerox or in the alternative, seeking leave to amend its petition to bring additional claims against Xerox.
On October 21, 2016, the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System (“plaintiff”) filed a purported securities class action complaint against Xerox Corporation, Ursula Burns, Luca Maestri, Kathryn Mikells, Lynn Blodgett and Robert Zapfel (collectively, “defendants”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of the plaintiff and certain purchasers or acquirers of Xerox common stock. The complaint alleged that defendants made false and misleading statements, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5, relating to the operations and prospects of Xerox’s Health Enterprise business. Plaintiff sought, among other things, unspecified monetary damages and attorneys’ fees. Other, similar lawsuits may follow. On December 28, 2016, the Court entered a stipulated order setting out a schedule for amendment of the complaint and for defendants’ response to that complaint following the Court’s appointment of lead plaintiff under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. On February 28, 2017, the Court issued an opinion and order appointing the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System ("APERS") as lead plaintiff. On May 1, 2017, APERS filed an amended complaint, alleging substantially similar claims and seeking substantially similar relief, but adding David Bywater and Mary Scanlon as defendants. On June 30, 2017, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint, and the motions were fully briefed on October 13, 2017. On March 20, 2018, the Court entered an opinion and order granting the motions, and on March 23, 2018, the Court entered a judgment of dismissal and closed the case. On April 20, 2018, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the appeal was fully briefed as of November 28, 2018. The Second Circuit heard oral argument on May 31, 2019. On June 6, 2019, the Second Circuit entered a summary order affirming the district court’s judgment dismissing the complaint. Plaintiff's time in which to request review by the U.S. Supreme Court expired on September 4, 2019; no such request was filed.

Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 5, 2019 (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”), among XC, Xerox Limited (“XL”), FH, FUJIFILM Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. (“FFAP”) and FX, among other things, FX will conduct a buyback of its shares from both FH and XL on a pro rata basis, pursuant to which XL will receive $770 (the “Share Buyback”). Following the Share Buyback, FFAP will purchase all of the outstanding equity interests of FX owned by XL (the “FFAP Purchase” and, together with the Share Buyback, the “FX Sale Transaction”), for a purchase price of $1,430 (the “FFAP Purchase Price”), which amount shall be increased by the amount of the dividends attributable to the period from October 1, 2019 to the date on which the FFAP Purchase occurs, calculated in accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement. 
Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement and on the terms set forth therein, the closing of the FX Sale Transaction will occur on November 8, 2019; provided, however, that if FH has not received early termination of the waiting period of the pre-transaction notification (jizen-todokede) required under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act of Japan (the “FEFTA Approval”) on or before November 5, 2019, then the Share Buyback will occur on November 8, 2019 and the FFAP Purchase will occur within three (3) business days following receipt of the FEFTA Approval. If the FEFTA Approval has not been received by March 24, 2020, then FH will consummate the FFAP Purchase on March 30, 2020, by either (i) replacing FFAP with another entity as the purchaser in the FFAP Purchase so the FEFTA Approval is no longer required in connection with the FFAP Purchase or (ii)
