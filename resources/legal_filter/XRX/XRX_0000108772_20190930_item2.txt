In March 2019, Xerox Corporation (“Xerox”) announced plans to create a new public holding company, Xerox Holdings Corporation (“Xerox Holdings”), by implementing a holding company reorganization (the “Reorganization”). On July 31, 2019, Xerox completed the Reorganization. In the Reorganization, Xerox became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox Holdings and Xerox Holdings became the successor issuer to Xerox. We believe implementation of a holding company structure will provide us with flexibility to develop and realize a range of strategic growth opportunities, including by pursuing different capital structures for new businesses, whether incubated or acquired. Refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation, Corporate Reorganization, in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Reorganization. 
To understand the trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars on revenue and expenses. We refer to this analysis as "constant currency", “currency impact” or “the impact from currency.” This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate. This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
Third quarter 2019 Net income attributable to Xerox Holdings increased $132 million as compared to third quarter 2018 primarily due to lower non-service retirement-related costs and Income tax expense as well as higher Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates. In addition, lower revenues were more than offset by the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements from our Project Own It transformation actions. Third quarter 2019 Adjusted1 net income attributable to Xerox Holdings increased $26 million as compared to third quarter 2018. The increase reflected increased operating profits as a result of the continued benefits from cost savings and productivity improvements from Project Own It, which more than offset the pace of revenue decline, as well as higher Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates.
Net income attributable to Xerox Holdings for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased $311 million as compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates as well as lower Income tax expense and non-service retirement-related costs. The increase also reflected the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements from our Project Own It transformation actions, which more than offset the impact of lower revenues. These benefits were partially offset by higher Restructuring and related costs. Adjusted1 net income attributable to Xerox Holdings for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased $87 million as compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily related to higher Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates as well as increased operating profits reflecting the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements from Project Own It, which more than offset the decline in revenues.
Revenues in the first half of 2019 were impacted by organizational changes, primarily in North America. This impact gradually mitigated during the latter part of the second quarter and was much less of an impact in the third quarter. We expect total revenues to decline approximately 7.9% in 2019, including an approximate 1.5-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency. Additionally, we continue to expect share repurchases of at least $600 million and dividend payments to shareholders of $250 million in 2019 and we increased our expectations for full year 2019 cash flows from operations to be between $1,175 million and $1,275 million, up from between $1,150 million to $1,250 million, and decreased our expectations for capital expenditures to $75 million, down from $150 million.
During second quarter 2019, we entered into an arrangement to expand our existing sourcing relationship with HP Inc. (HP). As part of the new arrangement, we will start sourcing certain A4 and entry-level A3 products from HP to diversify our supply chain. Many of these devices will operate with our ConnectKey software, a key differentiator in the marketplace.
In addition, we will provide toner for both our printers included in this agreement and certain HP printers, which will allow us to add volume to our emulsion aggregation (EA) toner plant in Webster, NY. Further, as part of our growth strategy to increase our penetration of the small-to-medium size business (SMB) market, Xerox will also become a Device as a Service (DaaS) partner for HP in the US. We will be able to sell HP PCs, displays and accessories, with or without DaaS, to our US SMB clients. Lastly, HP will also make DocuShare Flex, Xerox's cloud-based content management platform, available on commercial PCs distributed in the U.S., giving a major lift to our software growth strategy.
Refer to Note 23 - Subsequent Event in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these agreements as well as in our Current Report on form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 5, 2019.
The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to the prior year period, was driven by lower sales in North America, primarily reflecting the transitional impact associated with recently implemented organizational changes in our XBS sales organization, which continued to gradually stabilize in the third quarter 2019. The organizational changes were part of our Project Own It transformation actions and include the transitioning of accounts to implement coverage changes, consolidation of real estate locations and the reduction of management layers. The decrease also reflected lower revenues from our indirect channels in the U.S. and lower installs, primarily in our Americas region, as well as a lack of large deals in EMEA.
Installs reflect new placement of devices only. Revenue associated with equipment installations may be reflected up-front in Equipment sales or over time either through rental income or as part of our Xerox Services revenues (which are both reported within our post sale revenues), depending on the terms and conditions of our agreements with customers. Installs include activity from Xerox Services and Xerox-branded products shipped to our XBS sales unit. Detail by product group (see Geographic Sales Channels and Product and Offerings Definitions) is shown below.
•10% increase in color multifunction devices reflecting higher installs of ConnectKey devices primarily from our indirect channels in the U.S. partially offset by lower installs from EMEA.
•6% decrease in black-and-white multifunction devices driven by lower activity primarily from our indirect channels in the U.S. and from EMEA.
•12% increase in high-end color installs reflecting continued demand for our Iridesse production press and higher installs of our lower-end Versant production systems as well as higher activity from iGen in North America.
•22% decrease in high-end black-and-white systems. 
•1% increase in color multifunction devices reflecting higher installs of ConnectKey devices primarily from our indirect channels in the U.S. partially offset by lower installs from EMEA.

•6% decrease in mid-range color installs reflecting lower installs of ConnectKey devices primarily in our Americas region. The decrease was significantly impacted by lower activity as a result of the transactional impact associated with recently implemented organizational changes in our XBS sales organization (as part of our Project Own It transformation actions), which included the transitioning of accounts to implement coverage changes, consolidation of real estate locations and the reduction of management layers. 
•16% decrease in mid-range black-and-white reflecting lower installs of ConnectKey devices primarily from indirect channels in the U.S. and from EMEA.
•1% decrease in high-end color installs reflecting lower activity from iGen primarily in EMEA, partially offset by continued strong demand for our Iridesse production press and higher installs of our Versant production and inkjet cut-sheet systems. 
•22% decrease in high-end black-and-white systems reflecting market trends. 
•Americas, which includes our sales channels in the U.S. and Canada, as well as Mexico, and Central and South America.

•“Entry”, which includes A4 devices and desktop printers. Prices in this product group can range from approximately $150 to $3,000.
•“Mid-Range”, which includes A3 Office and Light Production devices that generally serve workgroup environments in mid to large enterprises. Prices in this product group can range from approximately $2,000 to $75,000+.
•“High-End”, which includes production printing and publishing systems that generally serve the graphic communications marketplace and large enterprises. Prices for these systems can range from approximately $30,000 to $1,000,000+.
Pre-tax income margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 of 7.7% increased 1.4-percentage points as compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by lower Transaction and related costs, net and lower Other Expenses, net as well lower operating expenses, primarily reflecting the net benefit from our Project Own It transformation actions. These benefits more than offset the adverse impact of higher Restructuring and related costs and lower revenues. 
SAG as a percentage of revenue of 23.3% decreased by 1.5-percentage points as compared to third quarter 2018, primarily reflecting the benefit from productivity and restructuring associated with our Project Own It transformation actions. 
SAG of $513 million decreased $70 million as compared to third quarter 2018, reflecting productivity and restructuring savings associated with our Project Own It transformation actions as well as lower compensation and incentives (consistent with lower revenues); the decrease also includes the favorable impacts of approximately $6 million from translation currency and $5 million from higher costs in the prior year associated with the termination of certain IT projects. Bad debt expense of $13 million was $3 million higher compared to third quarter 2018 and on a trailing twelve month basis (TTM) remained at less than one percent of total receivables.
SAG as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 of 23.6% decreased by 1.5-percentage points as compared to the prior year period, primarily reflecting the benefit from productivity and restructuring associated with our Project Own It transformation actions. 
SAG for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 of $1,580 million decreased $255 million as compared to the prior year period, reflecting productivity and restructuring savings associated with our Project Own It transformation actions as well as lower compensation and incentives (consistent with lower revenues); the decrease also includes favorable impacts of approximately $28 million from translation currency and $34 million from higher costs in the prior year related to the termination of certain IT projects and the accelerated depreciation associated with the exit of a surplus real estate facility. Bad debt expense of $38 million was $3 million higher compared to the prior year period and on a trailing twelve month basis (TTM) remained at less than one percent of total receivables.
Restructuring and asset impairment costs were $80 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and included $37 million of severance costs related to headcount reductions of approximately 450 employees worldwide, $18 million of other contractual termination costs and $48 million of asset impairment charges. These costs were partially offset by $23 million of net reversals, primarily resulting from changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives as well as $6 million in favorable adjustments from the early termination of prior period impaired leases. 
The implementation of our Project Own It initiatives as well as other business transformation initiatives is expected to result in significant cost savings in 2019 and future years. However, expected savings associated with these initiatives may be offset to some extent by business disruption during the implementation phase and until the initiatives are fully implemented and stabilized.
Restructuring and related costs were $91 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and included $104 million of severance costs related to headcount reductions of approximately 1,850 employees worldwide and $13 million of lease cancellation costs partially offset by $26 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives.
The restructuring reserve balance as of September 30, 2019 for all programs was $57 million, which is expected to be paid over the next twelve months.
Refer to Note 12 - Restructuring Programs in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring programs.
Worldwide employment was approximately 27,600 as of September 30, 2019 and decreased by approximately 4,800 from December 31, 2018. The reduction resulted from net attrition (attrition net of gross hires), of which a large portion is not expected to be backfilled, as well as the impact of organizational changes including employees transferred as part of the shared services arrangement entered into with HCL Technologies earlier this year.
Non-financing interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 of $80 million was $4 million lower than the prior year period. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $6 million from the prior year period primarily due to a lower debt balance.
Refer to Note 13 - Debt in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the interest expense.
Non-service retirement-related costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 decreased $35 million and $62 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, primarily driven by the favorable impact of a 2018 amendment to our U.S. Retiree Health Plan and lower losses from pension settlements in the U.S.
Refer to Note 16 - Employee Benefit Plans in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding non-service retirement-related costs.
Gains on sales of businesses and assets for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased $16 million as compared to the third quarter 2018, reflecting the sale of non-core business assets in the third quarter 2019. Gains on sales of businesses and assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 decreased by $15 million as compared to the prior year period, reflecting the higher sales of non-core business assets in the prior year.
Litigation matters for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $9 million lower than the prior year period, reflecting the favorable resolution of certain litigation matters in third quarter 2019.
Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates primarily reflects our 25% share of Fuji Xerox Net income (loss). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, equity income increased $15 million and $143 million as compared to the prior year periods, primarily reflecting savings from Fuji Xerox restructuring. Equity income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, also increased as a result of $7 million and $71 million of lower year-over-year charges related to our share of Fuji Xerox after-tax restructuring and other charges, as compared to the respective prior year periods. Additionally, equity income for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased as a result of an approximate $28 million charge related to an out-of-period charge at Fuji Xerox in the prior year. 
Refer to Note 11 - Investments in Affiliates, at Equity in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our Investment in Fuji Xerox as well as the prior period out-of-period adjustment.

We are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet. As permitted, certain of these derivative contracts have been designated for hedge accounting treatment. Certain of our derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are effective as economic hedges. These derivative contracts are likewise required to be recognized each period at fair value and therefore do result in some level of volatility. The level of volatility will vary with the type and amount of derivative hedges outstanding, as well as fluctuations in the currency and interest rate markets during the period. The related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.
By their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. The market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange and interest rate movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. We do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a diversified group of major financial institutions. Further, our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating. Credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties.
These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Refer to "Currency Impact" for a discussion of this measure and its use in our analysis of revenue growth.
