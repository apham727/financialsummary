Currency Impact
To better understand the trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars on revenue and expenses. We refer to this analysis as "constant currency", “currency impact” or “the impact from currency.” This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate. This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates. The constant currency impact for signings growth is calculated on the basis of plan currency rates.
Overview
Fuji Xerox Transaction and Recent Developments
Refer to Note 19 - Contingencies and Litigation and Note 20 - Fuji Xerox Transaction and Recent Developments in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to this terminated transaction and related matters.
Fuji Xerox Adjustments
In 2018, in connection with the completion of the audits of Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year-end financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, as well as the review of Fuji Xerox’s unaudited interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, additional adjustments and misstatements were identified. These additional adjustments and misstatements were to the previously reported Net income of Fuji Xerox for the period from 2010 through 2017 and are incremental to the items identified by the IIC noted above. These incremental adjustments primarily relate to Fuji Xerox’s Asia Pacific subsidiaries and involve improper revenue recognition, including revenue associated with leasing transactions, additional provisions for bad debt allowances and other asset impairments. In certain instances, some of the adjustments related to inappropriate accounting and reporting practices in the Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific subsidiaries and are further evidence of inadequate management oversight and an insufficient entity level monitoring system for financial statements of subsidiaries beyond what was previously identified by the IIC. Fuji Xerox is committed to implementing additional measures to remediate these newly identified issues.

Third Quarter 2018 Review
The decrease in Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the respective prior year periods was primarily due to lower revenues and higher Income tax expense, which included an additional charge of $95 million in third quarter 2018 related to the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"). These impacts were partially offset by the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements and lower non-service retirement-related costs. The decrease in Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was also partially offset by lower Transaction and related costs, net, primarily due to recoveries during third quarter 2018. The decrease in Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was negatively impacted by Transaction and related costs, net and lower Equity in net income from unconsolidated affiliates, which included our share of a significant restructuring charge recorded by Fuji Xerox in the first quarter of 2018. 
Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q
The decrease in adjusted1 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the respective prior year periods was primarily related to lower revenues and higher income tax expense, partially offset by the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements. The decrease in adjusted1 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was partially offset by higher Equity in net income from unconsolidated affiliates, while adjusted1 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was negatively impacted by lower Equity in net income from unconsolidated affiliates, which included an out-of-period adjustment recorded during the first quarter of 2018.
Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $725 million, as compared to a use of cash of $30 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to the prior year voluntary contributions of $500 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans and the reclassification of $170 million of collections of deferred proceeds and beneficial interests from the sale of receivables to investing cash flows as a result of an accounting change in the prior year (refer to Note 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Operating cash flows also increased due to improved working capital2 as well as lower other pension contributions. 
Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $40 million and included capital expenditures of $73 million, which were partially offset by proceeds of $32 million from the sale of non-core business assets. Cash used in financing activities was $815 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 reflecting $284 million for share repurchases, payments of $265 million on Senior Notes, $25 million related to the termination of a capital lease obligation, $19 million of bridge facility costs and dividend payments of $204 million.

Summary of Key Financial Ratios
Pre-tax Income Margin

The increase was primarily driven by lower Transaction and related costs, net as well as lower Restructuring and related costs and benefits from our business transformation actions which outpaced the revenue declines.
Pre-tax income margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of 6.3% increased 1.7-percentage points as compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by lower Restructuring and related costs and benefits from our business transformation actions as well as lower Other expenses, net, offset partially by revenue declines and Transaction and related costs, net.

Selling, Administrative and General Expenses (SAG)
SAG as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of 25.1% was flat as compared to the prior year period, reflecting primarily the benefit from productivity and restructuring associated with our business transformation actions. SAG as a percentage of revenue includes a 0.4-percentage point unfavorable impact from the exit of a real estate facility and the cancellation of certain IT projects.
SAG of $1,835 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $55 million lower than the prior year period, including an approximate $24 million unfavorable impact from currency. The reduction reflected primarily productivity and restructuring savings associated with our business transformation actions. These improvements were partially offset by $34 million of charges related to the accelerated depreciation from the early termination of a capital lease associated with a surplus facility ($22 million) and the cancellation of certain IT projects ($12 million). Bad debt expense of $35 million increased $5 million compared to the prior year period and on a trailing twelve month basis (TTM) remained at less than one percent of receivables.

Worldwide Employment
Worldwide employment was approximately 33,200 as of September 30, 2018 and decreased by approximately 2,100 from December 31, 2017, largely driven by our business transformation. Approximately half of the reduction was associated with restructuring actions, while the remainder resulted from net attrition (attrition net of gross hires), of which a large portion is not expected to be backfilled.
Other Expenses, Net
Non-financing interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was $28 million and was $1 million lower than third quarter of 2017. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $1 million from third quarter of 2017 due to a lower debt balance, partially offset by higher average interest rates.
Non-financing interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $84 million and was $5 million lower as compared to the prior year period. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $4 million from the prior year comparable period primarily due to a lower debt balance reflecting debt repayments of approximately $1.3 billion in the first quarter 2017 partially offset by $1.0 billion of new debt issued in the third quarter 2017 to fund, among other things, a $500 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans, partially offset by higher average interest rates.
Non-service retirement-related costs decreased $2 million and $46 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior year periods. Both period decreases were primarily driven by the favorable impact of higher pension contributions and asset returns in the prior year, with the decrease in third quarter 2018 partially offset by higher losses from pension settlements in the U.S.
Gains on Sales of Businesses and Assets
Gains on the sales of business and assets increased $21 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the prior year period, reflecting a higher level of sales of non-core business assets in 2018.
