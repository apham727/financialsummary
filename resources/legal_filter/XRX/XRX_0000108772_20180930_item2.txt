To better understand the trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars on revenue and expenses. We refer to this analysis as "constant currency", “currency impact” or “the impact from currency.” This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate. This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates. The constant currency impact for signings growth is calculated on the basis of plan currency rates.
Refer to Note 19 - Contingencies and Litigation and Note 20 - Fuji Xerox Transaction and Recent Developments in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to this terminated transaction and related matters.
In 2018, in connection with the completion of the audits of Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year-end financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, as well as the review of Fuji Xerox’s unaudited interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, additional adjustments and misstatements were identified. These additional adjustments and misstatements were to the previously reported Net income of Fuji Xerox for the period from 2010 through 2017 and are incremental to the items identified by the IIC noted above. These incremental adjustments primarily relate to Fuji Xerox’s Asia Pacific subsidiaries and involve improper revenue recognition, including revenue associated with leasing transactions, additional provisions for bad debt allowances and other asset impairments. In certain instances, some of the adjustments related to inappropriate accounting and reporting practices in the Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific subsidiaries and are further evidence of inadequate management oversight and an insufficient entity level monitoring system for financial statements of subsidiaries beyond what was previously identified by the IIC. Fuji Xerox is committed to implementing additional measures to remediate these newly identified issues.

The decrease in Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the respective prior year periods was primarily due to lower revenues and higher Income tax expense, which included an additional charge of $95 million in third quarter 2018 related to the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"). These impacts were partially offset by the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements and lower non-service retirement-related costs. The decrease in Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was also partially offset by lower Transaction and related costs, net, primarily due to recoveries during third quarter 2018. The decrease in Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was negatively impacted by Transaction and related costs, net and lower Equity in net income from unconsolidated affiliates, which included our share of a significant restructuring charge recorded by Fuji Xerox in the first quarter of 2018. 
The decrease in adjusted1 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the respective prior year periods was primarily related to lower revenues and higher income tax expense, partially offset by the continued benefits of cost savings and productivity improvements. The decrease in adjusted1 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was partially offset by higher Equity in net income from unconsolidated affiliates, while adjusted1 Net income from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was negatively impacted by lower Equity in net income from unconsolidated affiliates, which included an out-of-period adjustment recorded during the first quarter of 2018.
Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $725 million, as compared to a use of cash of $30 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to the prior year voluntary contributions of $500 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans and the reclassification of $170 million of collections of deferred proceeds and beneficial interests from the sale of receivables to investing cash flows as a result of an accounting change in the prior year (refer to Note 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Operating cash flows also increased due to improved working capital2 as well as lower other pension contributions.

Equipment sales revenue decreased 3.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to third quarter 2017, with a 1.1-percentage point unfavorable impact from currency, while equipment sales revenue decreased 1.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to the prior year period, with a 1.3-percentage point favorable impact from currency. Both periods were impacted by price declines of approximately 5% (which were in-line with our historic declines). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the decline at constant currency1 included a 4.5-percentage point and a 3.4-percentage point impact, respectively, from lower OEM equipment sales.
•Entry - For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the increase in both periods, compared to their respective prior year periods, reflected higher sales of our ConnectKey devices in developing markets and U.S. indirect channels.
•High-end - For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the decrease primarily reflected lower revenues from iGen in the U.S. along with lower revenues from black-and-white systems consistent with market decline trends. These declines were only partially mitigated by demand for the recently launched Iridesse production press. For the three months ended September 30, 2018, the decrease was also attributed to lower installs of the Versant systems (partially as a result of lapping the prior year launch).
•8% decrease in color multifunction devices, reflecting lower sales through our U.S. channels.
•21% increase in black-and-white multifunction devices, driven largely by higher activity from low-end devices in developing markets as well as higher sales of our ConnectKey devices through indirect channels in the U.S. and Europe. 
•19% increase in mid-range black-and-white, reflecting demand for recently launched products across all geographies.
•17% decrease in high-end color installs, as demand for our new Iridesse production press was offset by lower installs of iGen and lower-end production systems. 
•5% increase in color multifunction devices, reflecting higher activity for our ConnectKey products in our Global Imaging business and our developing markets.
•20% increase in black-and-white multifunction devices, driven largely by higher activity from low-end devices in developing markets as well as higher sales of our ConnectKey devices through U.S. and Europe's indirect channels. 
•18% increase in mid-range color installs, reflecting higher demand from our ConnectKey devices across large enterprise and indirect channels, as well as higher sales of lower-end A3 devices in developing markets.
•7% decrease in high-end color systems, as demand for our new Iridesse production press and cut-sheet inkjet products was offset by lower installs of iGen and lower-end production systems.

Signings for the three months ended September 30, 2018 decreased 2.1% from third quarter 2017, including a 0.7-percentage point favorable impact from currency, and signings for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased 8.1% from the prior year period, including a 1.0-percentage point favorable impact from currency. The decrease in both periods reflected a lower renewal rate as a result of ongoing competitive pressure in the market. On a trailing twelve month (TTM) basis, signings decreased 6.5% from the comparable prior year period, with a 1.1-percentage point favorable impact from currency. 
New business TCV for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased 15.7% from third quarter 2017, led by activity in Europe and included a 0.7-percentage point favorable impact from currency.

Third quarter 2018 pre-tax income margin of 8.2% increased 1.5-percentage points as compared to third quarter 2017. The increase was primarily driven by lower Transaction and related costs, net as well as lower Restructuring and related costs and benefits from our business transformation actions which outpaced the revenue declines.
Pre-tax income margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of 6.3% increased 1.7-percentage points as compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by lower Restructuring and related costs and benefits from our business transformation actions as well as lower Other expenses, net, offset partially by revenue declines and Transaction and related costs, net. 
Third quarter 2018 adjusted1 operating margin of 13.1% increased 1.0-percentage points as compared to third quarter 2017, including a 0.4-percentage point favorable impact from transaction currency. The increase primarily reflects higher equity income and SAG savings and cost productivity associated with our business transformation actions which more than offset the pace of revenue decline.
SAG as a percentage of revenue of 24.8% decreased 0.4-percentage points compared to third quarter 2017, reflecting primarily the benefit from productivity and restructuring associated with our business transformation actions. 
SAG as a percentage of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 of 25.1% was flat as compared to the prior year period, reflecting primarily the benefit from productivity and restructuring associated with our business transformation actions. SAG as a percentage of revenue includes a 0.4-percentage point unfavorable impact from the exit of a real estate facility and the cancellation of certain IT projects.
SAG of $1,835 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $55 million lower than the prior year period, including an approximate $24 million unfavorable impact from currency. The reduction reflected primarily productivity and restructuring savings associated with our business transformation actions. These improvements were partially offset by $34 million of charges related to the accelerated depreciation from the early termination of a capital lease associated with a surplus facility ($22 million) and the cancellation of certain IT projects ($12 million). Bad debt expense of $35 million increased $5 million compared to the prior year period and on a trailing twelve month basis (TTM) remained at less than one percent of receivables.
Restructuring and related costs were $91 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and included $104 million of severance costs related to headcount of approximately 1,850 employees worldwide and $13 million of lease cancellation costs partially offset by $26 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives.
Third quarter 2017 Restructuring and related costs of $35 million included net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $34 million as well as $1 million of additional costs primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the strategic transformation program. Third quarter 2017 net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $34 million included $39 million of severance costs related to headcount of approximately 600 employees worldwide. These costs were partially offset by $5 million of net reversals for changes in estimated reserves from prior period initiatives. The third quarter 2017 actions impacted several functional areas, with approximately 80% focused on SAG reductions and approximately 20% focused on gross margin improvements. 
Restructuring and related costs were $192 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and included net restructuring and asset impairment charges of $174 million as well as $18 million of additional costs primarily related to professional support services associated with the implementation of the strategic transformation program.

We continue to pursue additional recoveries from insurance carriers and other parties for costs and expenses related to the terminated transaction and shareholder litigation and therefore additional recoveries and adjustments may be recorded in future periods, when finalized. 
Worldwide employment was approximately 33,200 as of September 30, 2018 and decreased by approximately 2,100 from December 31, 2017, largely driven by our business transformation. Approximately half of the reduction was associated with restructuring actions, while the remainder resulted from net attrition (attrition net of gross hires), of which a large portion is not expected to be backfilled.
Non-service retirement-related costs decreased $2 million and $46 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior year periods. Both period decreases were primarily driven by the favorable impact of higher pension contributions and asset returns in the prior year, with the decrease in third quarter 2018 partially offset by higher losses from pension settlements in the U.S.
Gains on sales of businesses and assets decreased $10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 as compared to third quarter 2017, reflecting primarily the prior year sale of a research facility in Grenoble, France (which primarily supported the discontinued BPO business).

We are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet. As permitted, certain of these derivative contracts have been designated for hedge accounting treatment. Certain of our derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are effective as economic hedges. These derivative contracts are likewise required to be recognized each period at fair value and therefore do result in some level of volatility. The level of volatility will vary with the type and amount of derivative hedges outstanding, as well as fluctuations in the currency and interest rate markets during the period. The related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.
