Currency Impact
To better understand the trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to analyze the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars on revenue and expenses. We refer to this analysis as "constant currency", “currency impact” or “the impact from currency.” This impact is calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period's currency translation rate. This impact is calculated for all countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. We do not hedge the translation effect of revenues or expenses denominated in currencies where the local currency is the functional currency. Management believes the constant currency measure provides investors an additional perspective on revenue trends. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates. The constant currency impact for signings growth is calculated on the basis of plan currency rates.

Fuji Xerox Transaction and Recent Developments
Refer to Note 18 - Contingencies and Litigation and Note 19 - Fuji Xerox Transaction and Recent Developments in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to this terminated transaction and related matters.
Fuji Xerox Adjustments
In 2018, in connection with the completion of the audits of Fuji Xerox’s fiscal year-end financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, as well as the review of Fuji Xerox’s unaudited interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, additional adjustments and misstatements were identified. These additional adjustments and misstatements were to the previously reported Net income of Fuji Xerox for the period from 2010 through 2017 and are incremental to the items identified by the IIC noted above. These incremental adjustments primarily relate to Fuji Xerox’s Asia Pacific subsidiaries and involve improper revenue recognition, including revenue associated with leasing transactions, additional provisions for bad debt allowances and other asset impairments. In certain instances, some of the adjustments related to inappropriate accounting and reporting practices in the Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific subsidiaries and are further evidence of inadequate management oversight and an insufficient entity level monitoring system for financial statements of subsidiaries beyond what was previously identified by the IIC. Fuji Xerox is committed to implementing additional measures to remediate these newly identified issues. 
Second Quarter 2018 Review
Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q
Operating cash flow from continuing operations attributable to Xerox for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $451 million, as compared to $413 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to the prior year reclassification of $110 million of collections of deferred proceeds and beneficial interests from the sale of receivables to investing cash flows as a result of an accounting change (refer to Note 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) and improved working capital2.
Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $17 million and included capital expenditures of $50 million, which were partially offset by proceeds of $32 million from the sale of non-core business assets. Cash used in financing activities of $456 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily reflects payments of $265 million on Senior Notes, $25 million related to the termination of a capital lease obligation, $19 million of bridge facility costs and dividend payments of $135 million.

Other Expenses, Net
Non-financing interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was $27 million and increased $3 million as compared to the second quarter of 2017. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense increased by $3 million as compared to the second quarter of 2017 due to a higher debt balance reflecting $1.0 billion of new debt issued in the third quarter 2017 to fund, among other things, a $500 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans partially offset by lower average interest rates.
Non-financing interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $56 million and decreased $4 million as compared to the prior year period. When combined with financing interest expense (Cost of financing), total interest expense decreased by $3 million from the prior year comparable period primarily due to a lower debt balance reflecting debt repayments of approximately $1.3 billion in the first quarter 2017 partially offset by $1.0 billion of new debt issued in the third quarter 2017 to fund, among other things, a $500 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans; the decline also reflected lower average interest rates.
Non-service retirement-related costs decreased $9 million and $44 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the prior year periods. Both period decreases were primarily driven by the favorable impact of higher pension contributions and asset returns in the prior year. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was also driven by lower losses from pension settlements as compared to the prior year period.
Gains on Sales of Businesses and Assets
Gains on sales of businesses and assets for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 of $16 million and $32 million, respectively, reflected the sale of non-core business assets.
