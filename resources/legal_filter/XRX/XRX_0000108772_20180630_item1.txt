Note 2 – Adoption of New Revenue Recognition Standard
Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q
Significant judgments primarily include the identification of performance obligations in our Document management services arrangements as well the pattern of delivery for those services. 
Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q
With respect to fair value, we perform an analysis of equipment fair value based on cash selling prices during the applicable period. The cash selling prices are compared to the range of values determined for our leases. The range of cash selling prices must be reasonably consistent with the lease selling prices in order for us to determine that such lease prices are indicative of fair value.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract of $23 and $40, respectively, were deferred and the related amortization was $24 and $48, respectively. The balance of deferred incremental direct costs net of accumulated amortization at June 30, 2018 was $176. This amount is expected to be amortized over its estimated period of benefit, which we currently estimate to be approximately four years.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, with additional amendments being issued in 2018. This update requires the recognition of right-to-use assets and lease obligations by lessees for those leases currently classified as operating leases under existing lease guidance. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. Short term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not required to be recognized. The update also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosure of key information regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements to increase transparency and comparability among companies. 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets. The update impacts financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through Net income. This update is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.

Interest Rate Risk Management
We use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure and to achieve a desired proportion of variable and fixed rate debt. These derivatives may be designated as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges depending on the nature of the risk being hedged.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
•Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities
•Forecasted purchases and sales in foreign currency
At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had outstanding forward exchange and purchased option contracts with gross notional values of $1,925 and $1,788 respectively, with terms of less than 12 months. Approximately 85% of the contracts at June 30, 2018 mature within three months, 7% mature in three to six months and 8% in six to twelve months. The associated currency exposures being hedged at June 30, 2018 were materially consistent with our year-end currency exposures. There has not been any material change in our hedging strategy.

Summary of Derivative Instruments Fair Value
Summary of Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)
Designated Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)
Non-Designated Derivative Instruments Gains (Losses)
Non-designated derivative instruments are primarily instruments used to hedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. They are not designated as hedges since there is a natural offset for the re-measurement of the underlying foreign currency-denominated asset or liability.
Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 currency (losses) gains, net were $(1) and $1, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 currency losses, net were $(1) and $(4), respectively. Net currency gains and losses include the mark-to-market adjustments of the derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and the related cost of those derivatives as well as the re-measurement of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and are included in Other expenses, net.
Note 13 – Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities
Fair value for our deferred compensation plan investments in mutual funds is based on quoted market prices for those funds. Fair value for deferred compensation plan liabilities is based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment selections.
Summary of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities 
The fair value amounts for Cash and cash equivalents and Accounts receivable, net, approximate carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair value of Short-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, and Long-term debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to us for debt of similar maturities (Level 2). The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at such date.

Litigation Against the Company

Another complaint filed by Darwin Deason, a Xerox shareholder, against Xerox and its directors in the same Court on March 2, 2018 alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by refusing Mr. Deason’s request for a waiver of the deadline for nomination of a new slate of Xerox directors, and sought to enjoin Xerox and its directors from enforcing Xerox’s advance notice by-laws, thereby allowing Mr. Deason to proceed with the nominations, as well as costs, fees, and other relief.
On April 27, 2018, the Court issued decisions and orders granting plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motions, which (i) enjoin Xerox from “taking any further action to consummate the change of control transaction between Xerox and Fuji that was announced on January 31, 2018 pending a final determination of the claims asserted in the underlying action;” (ii) enjoin Xerox from enforcing its advance notice bylaw provision requiring shareholders to nominate directors for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting by December 11, 2017; and (iii) require Xerox to waive such advance notice bylaw provision to permit the noticing of a slate of director nominees for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting, and denying defendants’ motions to dismiss.
On May 1, 2018, Xerox entered into a Director Appointment, Nomination and Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, among others, that would have resolved the pending proxy contest in connection with Xerox’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, as well as the ongoing litigation brought by Mr. Deason against Xerox and its directors related to the Fuji Transaction. The agreement expired by its terms on May 3, 2018 without becoming effective.
On May 7, 2018, defendants filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department, notices of appeal of, and motions to stay pending appeal, the lower Court’s decision and order. Defendants also moved the appellate court for interim relief ordering that the appeal be heard on an expedited basis. At a hearing before the appellate court on May 7, 2018, the appellate court ruled that the appeals would be heard on an expedited basis and granted a partial interim stay allowing Xerox and Fujifilm to take steps to seek regulatory approvals related to the Fuji Transaction pending a ruling from the appellate court on defendants’ motions to stay pending appeal.
On May 13, 2018, a settlement agreement with respect to the Deason cases was signed on behalf of plaintiff Deason, the Icahn Group and related parties, and all defendants except Fujifilm, and a memorandum of understanding regarding settlement of the putative class case was signed by all defendants except Fujifilm. Pursuant to the settlements, the settling defendants withdrew their appeal and motion to stay in the Deason cases. The settling defendants also withdrew their motion to stay in the putative class case. Fujifilm's appeal and motion for a stay of the proceedings in the first Deason case and the putative class case remain pending before the Appellate Division. The Court entered a stipulation of discontinuance as to the settling parties in the second Deason case on May 14, 2018, and agreed on June 22, 2018 to do the same in the first Deason case. 
On June 19, 2018, the putative class plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of a stipulation of settlement that would resolve the claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the putative class case against all defendants, other than Fujifilm. Carmen Ribbe, the plaintiff in the below derivative action, and Fujifilm filed oppositions to the motion on July 10, 2018. 
On June 22, 2018, the Court entered an order denying a joint motion by the putative class plaintiffs and the settling defendants to dissolve the injunction in the class case as against the settling defendants, and entered an order denying Fujifilm’s motion to dissolve the injunctions in the class case and the first Deason case in their entirety. The class has not yet been certified, and preliminary approval has not been granted.

to that complaint following the Court’s appointment of lead plaintiff under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. On February 28, 2017, the Court issued an opinion and order appointing the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System ("APERS") as lead plaintiff. On May 1, 2017, APERS filed an amended complaint, alleging substantially similar claims and seeking substantially similar relief, but adding David Bywater and Mary Scanlon as defendants. On June 30, 2017, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint, and the motions were fully briefed on October 13, 2017. On March 20, 2018, the Court entered an opinion and order granting the motions, and on March 23, 2018, the Court entered a judgment of dismissal and closed the case. On April 20, 2018, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Xerox will vigorously defend against this matter. At this time, it is premature to make any conclusion regarding the probability of incurring material losses in this litigation. Should developments cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome, or result in a final adverse judgment or settlement, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period in which such change in determination, judgment, or settlement occurs.
Other Contingencies
Note 19 – Fuji Xerox Transaction and Recent Developments
Pending Litigation Relating to the Fuji Transaction
Refer to Note 18 - Contingencies and Litigation for discussion of the Pending Litigation Relating to the Fuji Xerox Transaction.
Fuji Xerox Transaction Overview and Termination of Agreement
On January 31, 2018, Xerox entered into (i) a Redemption Agreement with FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation, a Japanese company (“Fujifilm”), and Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd., a Japanese company, in which Xerox indirectly holds a 25% equity interest while Fujifilm holds the remaining 75% equity interest (“Fuji Xerox”), and (ii) a Subscription Agreement with Fujifilm (collectively, the “Transaction Agreements”). Under the terms of the Transaction Agreements, Fuji Xerox would have become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox, Xerox shareholders would have received a $2.5 billion special cash dividend and Xerox would have become owned 49.9% by Xerox's shareholders as of the closing date for the transaction and 50.1% by Fujifilm. 
On May 13, 2018, prior to the entry into the Settlement Agreement discussed in Note 18 - Contingencies and Litigation, the Company delivered a written notice of termination of the Subscription Agreement to Fujifilm in accordance with the terms of the Subscription Agreement, which provided the Company with certain terminations rights, including (a) if the audited financial statements of FX deviate in any material respect from the unaudited financial statements of FX and its subsidiaries provided to the Company prior to the date of the Subscription Agreement and (b) if Fujifilm or FX fails to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in the Subscription Agreement that would cause certain conditions to 
Xerox 2018 Form 10-Q
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreement not to be satisfied, which breach or failure to perform cannot be cured or, if capable of cure, has not been cured by the earlier of 30 days following written notice thereof from the Company to Fujifilm. By virtue of the termination of the Subscription Agreement, the Redemption Agreement terminated automatically. The Company's termination of the Transaction Agreements is the subject of pending litigation.
As a result of the failure by Fujifilm to deliver the audited financial statements of FX by April 15, 2018 and the material deviations reflected in the audited financial statements of FX, when delivered, the Company determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to terminate the Subscription Agreement in accordance with the termination rights set forth therein, taking into account other circumstances limiting the ability of the Company, Fujifilm and FX to consummate a transaction.
On January 31, 2018, Xerox entered into a Commitment Letter with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., which provided a commitment for a $2.5 billion unsecured bridge loan facility that would have been available for Xerox to pay the special one-time cash dividend of $2.5 billion to existing shareholders of Xerox in connection with the Transaction Agreements, as described above.
Concurrent with the termination of the Transaction Agreements, the commitment to provide the unsecured bridge loan facility was terminated in the second quarter 2018 and, as a result, the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs of $16 were written-off. 
In July 2018, the Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program (exclusive of any commissions and other transaction fees and costs). This program replaces the $245 of authority remaining under the Company's previously authorized share repurchase program.
The information set forth under Note 18 – Contingencies and Litigation in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is incorporated by reference in answer to this Item.
