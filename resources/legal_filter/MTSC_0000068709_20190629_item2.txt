Overview



MTS Systems Corporation's testing and simulation hardware, software and service solutions help customers accelerate and improve their design, development and manufacturing processes and are used for determining the mechanical behavior of materials, products and structures.
Our high-performance sensors provide measurements of vibration, pressure, position, force and sound in a variety of applications.
As of September 29, 2018, we had 3,400 employees and revenue of $778,032 for fiscal year 2018.
Further globalization and expansion of many industries along with growth in emerging markets, provide a strong and vibrant market base from which we can grow revenue.
We are looking ahead to delivering distinctive business performance through our commitment to sustain the differentiated competitive advantage that comes from offering an innovative portfolio of Test & Simulation and Sensors solutions that create value for customers and are delivered with total customer satisfaction.
Acquisition



On November 21, 2018, we acquired E2M Technologies B.V. (E2M) for a cash purchase price of $80,287.
We funded the acquisition of E2M through borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility.
See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the acquisition of E2M.
Financing



On November 21, 2018, we amended the Credit Agreement to increase the size of our Revolving Credit Facility from $120,000 to $150,000 and to extend the expiration date to July 5, 2022.
The size of the Revolving Credit Facility was increased to finance the purchase of E2M.
See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the amendment to the Credit Agreement.
Conversion of 8.75% Tangible Equity Units (TEUs)



During the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, certain holders of our TEUs elected to early convert the equity component on 394 of our outstanding TEUs at the minimum conversion rate of 1.9841 which resulted in the issuance of 781 shares of our common stock.
Foreign Currency



Approximately 70% of our revenue has historically been derived from customers outside of the U.S. Our financial results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan.
The discussion below quantifies the impact of foreign currency translation on our financial results for the periods discussed.
Adoption of New Revenue Recognition Standard



In fiscal year 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), followed by related amendments (collectively, "the new revenue standard" or "ASC 606").
See Note 2 and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the impact of this adoption on our Consolidated Income Statements and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Revenue for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 19.3% and 15.2%, respectively, primarily driven by growth in both the Test & Simulation and Sensors businesses, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
Test & Simulation revenue for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased $32,273 and $80,424, respectively, primarily driven by volume growth from conversion of robust beginning-of-year backlog across all sectors and the acquisition of E2M in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
The increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
Sensors revenue for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased $5,231 and $8,055, respectively, primarily driven by growth in the Sensors test sector from a multi-year contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, growth in the Sensors position sector in the first half of the fiscal year and growth in the Sensors industrial sector from strength in the energy market, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
Excluding the impact of currency translation and the E2M acquisition, revenue increased 17.8% and 13.8%, respectively.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Gross profit for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 11.6% and 9.5%, respectively, primarily driven by revenue growth in Test & Simulation and the gross profit contribution from the E2M acquisition.
This increase was partially offset by increased compensation expense, the E2M inventory acquisition adjustment of $157 and $1,141, respectively, and the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
Gross margin declined 2.6 and 2.0 percentage points, respectively, primarily due to higher compensation expense, revenue mix between Test & Simulation and Sensors, and the E2M inventory acquisition adjustment.
This decrease was partially offset by favorable leverage on higher revenue volume and strong project execution in Test & Simulation.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, the E2M acquisition, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, gross profit increased 9.6% and 8.1% and gross margin declined 2.8 and 2.0 percentage points, respectively.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Selling and marketing expense for the three months ended June 29, 2019 increased 3.6% primarily due to increased compensation expense to support sales growth, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation.
Selling and marketing expense for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 4.2% primarily due to increased compensation and commissions expense to support sales growth and the addition of E2M expenses, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation.
36

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



General and administrative expense for the three months ended June 29, 2019 increased 8.1% primarily due to the addition of E2M expenses, higher compensation expense in Sensors and increased professional fees, partially offset by lower compensation expense in Test & Simulation.
General and administrative expense for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 8.8% primarily due to the addition of E2M expenses, acquisition-related expenses, higher compensation expense in Sensors and increased professional fees, partially offset by lower compensation expense in Test & Simulation.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Research and development (R&D) expense for the three months ended June 29, 2019 declined 6.9% primarily due to the shift of internal resources to capital projects in Test & Simulation, partially offset by the addition of E2M expenses.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, E2M expenses and restructuring costs incurred in the prior year, R&D expense decreased 9.5%.
R&D expense for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 declined 12.3% primarily due to the shift of internal resources to capital projects and lower compensation expense in Test & Simulation, partially offset by the addition of E2M expenses and continued investment in new product development in Sensors.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Income from operations for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased 41.4% and 31.9%, respectively, primarily due to increased gross profit on higher revenue volume and the impact of the E2M acquisition, partially offset by higher compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Interest expense, net for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased primarily due to an increase in interest expense on the revolving credit facility drawn on in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 to fund the acquisition of E2M, which was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to lower balances on the tranche B term loan, as well as current year favorable effects of our interest rate swap.
37

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in other income (expense), net for the three months ended June 29, 2019 was primarily driven by a relative increase in losses on foreign currency transactions, partially offset by an increase in rental income.
The increase in other income (expense), net for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in rental income, partially offset by a relative increase in losses on foreign currency transactions.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 29, 2019 increased primarily due to higher earnings before tax and the reversal of a $1,297 discrete tax benefit originally recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) as a result of regulatory updates issued during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019.
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 increased primarily due to certain discrete benefits of $25,378 in the prior year for the estimated impact of the Tax Act.
Excluding the impact of these discrete benefits, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 would have been 15.2%.
The decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the implementation of the lower 21% U.S. statutory rate for fiscal year 2019 as compared to the blended statutory rate of 24.5% effective in fiscal year 2018.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 29, 2019 increased primarily due to higher income from operations in Test & Simulation, partially offset by lower income from operations in Sensors.
Net income and diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended June 29, 2019 decreased primarily due to an increase in the effective tax rate and lower income from operations in Sensors, partially offset by higher income from operations in Test & Simulation.

Cash Flow Comparison



The following table summarizes our cash flows from total operations:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Operating Activities



The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash used by working capital associated with timing fluctuations from accounts receivable payments received and unbilled accounts receivable accruals, accounts payable payments, advanced payments received from customers, and inventory purchases, as well as a decrease in net income due to the remeasurement of our estimated deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Act in fiscal year 2018.
This decrease was partially offset by a reduction in cash used by deferred income taxes due to the Tax Act in fiscal year 2018, an increase in cash provided by other assets and liabilities related to accrued project costs, and a decrease in cash used by payroll-related accruals.
Investing Activities



The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of E2M in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 as well as an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment for continued strategic investments in the business.
Financing Activities



The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility used to fund the acquisition of E2M and a decrease in cash used for long-term debt payments due to required annual Excess Cash Flow payments made in fiscal year 2018.
Liquidity and Capital Resources



We had cash and cash equivalents of $75,735 as of June 29, 2019.
Of this amount, $21,623 was located in North America, $28,601 in Europe and $25,511 in Asia.
The North American cash balance was primarily invested in bank deposits.
The cash balances in Europe and Asia were primarily invested in money market funds and bank deposits.
In accordance with our investment policy, we place cash equivalent investments with issuers who have high-quality investment credit ratings.
Our investment objectives are to preserve principal, maintain liquidity and achieve the best available return consistent with our primary objectives of safety and liquidity.
As of June 29, 2019, we held no short-term investments.
We plan to continue to repatriate certain amounts of our existing offshore cash and future earnings back to the U.S. 



44

As of June 29, 2019, our capital structure was comprised of $31,634 in short-term debt, $440,767 in long-term debt and $494,539 in shareholders' equity.
Long-term debt included $80,391 on our Revolving Credit Facility used to finance the acquisition of E2M.
The Consolidated Balance Sheets also included $9,885 of unamortized debt issuance costs as of June 29, 2019.
Total interest-bearing debt as of June 29, 2019 was $472,401.
We have a credit agreement with a consortium of financial institutions (the Credit Agreement) that provides for senior secured credit facilities consisting of a Revolving Credit Facility and a Term Facility.
The maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility is July 5, 2022 and the maturity date of the loans under the Term Facility is July 5, 2023, unless a term loan lender agrees to extend the maturity date pursuant to a loan modification agreement made in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement also requires mandatory prepayments on our Term Facility in certain circumstances, including the potential for an annual required prepayment of a certain percentage of our excess cash flow.
Under the Credit Agreement, we are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, restrictions on our ability to incur debt, create liens, dispose of assets, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into any restrictive agreements and customary events of default (including payment defaults, covenant defaults, change of control defaults and bankruptcy defaults).
The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants, including the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to adjusted consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), as defined in the Credit Agreement, as well as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense.
These covenants restrict our ability to pay dividends and purchase outstanding shares of common stock.
As of June 29, 2019, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.
See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our financing arrangements.
Shareholders' equity increased by $16,607 during the nine months ended June 29, 2019 primarily due to $38,246 net income and $7,515 stock-based compensation.
The increase was partially offset by $16,355 dividends declared and $6,885 other comprehensive loss.
Also contributing to the decrease was a cumulative effect of accounting change reduction to our opening retained earnings balance of $6,227 related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
As of June 29, 2019, we believe our current capital resources will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and operations for the foreseeable future, including at least the next twelve months.
See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for changes to our capital structure incurred subsequent to the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2019.
For further information, see "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" under Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018.
The following critical accounting policy has been updated since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018.
Revenue Recognition (Over Time)



Revenue is recognized either over time as work progresses or at a point-in-time, dependent upon contract-specific terms and the pattern of transfer of control of the product or service to the customer.
Contracts with equipment revenue recognized over time use costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying the performance obligation.
Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer.
Equipment contract costs include materials, component parts, labor and overhead costs.
For contracts 



45

recognized over time, we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract.
These assumptions include labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, and internal and subcontractor performance.
We recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catch-up method.
Under this method, the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified.
Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance is recognized using the adjusted estimate.
If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the total loss in the period it is identified.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Other Matters



Dividends



Our dividend policy is to maintain a payout ratio that allows dividends to increase in conjunction with the long-term growth of earnings per share, while sustaining dividends through economic cycles.
Our dividend practice is to target, over time, a payout ratio of approximately 25% of net earnings per share.
The declaration and payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our earnings, financial condition, debt repayment obligations, business development needs and regulatory considerations and are at the discretion of our Board of Directors.
Forward-looking statements are qualified by some or all of these risk factors.
