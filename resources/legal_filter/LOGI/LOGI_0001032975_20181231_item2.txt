Overview of Our Company
Logitech is a world leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing products that help connect people to digital and cloud experiences. More than 35 years ago, Logitech created products to improve experiences around the personal PC platform, and today it is a multi-brand, multi-category company designing products that enable better experiences consuming, sharing and creating any digital content such as music, gaming, video and computing, whether it is on a computer, mobile device or in the cloud. Logitech's brands include Logitech, Ultimate Ears, Jaybird, Blue Microphones, Logitech G and ASTRO Gaming. Our Company's website is www.logitech.com. 
 On August 21, 2018 (the "Acquisition Date"), we acquired all equity interests in Blue Microphones Holding Corporation ("Blue Microphones") for a total consideration of $134.8 million in cash (the "Blue Microphones Acquisition"), which includes a working capital adjustment and repayment of a debt on behalf of Blue Microphones. Blue Microphones is a leading audio manufacturer that designs and produces microphones, headphones, recording tools, and accessories for audio professionals, musicians and consumers. The Blue Microphones Acquisition is consistent with Logitech's merger and acquisition strategy and will supplement the Company's portfolio in the microphones market. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, Blue Microphones contributed three percentage point and two percentage points, respectively, of the net sales growth rate.
Summary of Financial Results
Our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 increased 6% and 10%, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, supported by stronger net sales in Asia Pacific. 
Our net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2018 increased 1%, 6%, and 18% in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific, respectively, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. Our net sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 increased 7%, 4% and 23% in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, respectively, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year.
Our gross margin for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 increased 190 basis points to 37.2% from 35.3% for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to supply chain efficiencies, cost reduction efforts, favorable exchange rates, tariff duty refund, and Topic 606 adoption, partially offset by an increase in tariffs. In addition, additional costs from the transition of the distribution center in North America in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 negatively affected the gross margin of the prior year period.
Operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2018 were $200.6 million, or 23.2% of net sales, compared to $175.3 million, or 21.6% of net sales, in the same period of the prior fiscal year. Operating expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 were $583.1 million, or 26.9% of net sales, compared to $506.4 million, or 25.6% of net sales, in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2018, was primarily driven by $13.0 million higher personnel-related cost primarily due to additional headcount from business acquisition and increased performance-based variable 
compensation and $2.6 million higher advertising and marketing expenses to support our new product introductions.The increase in operating expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily driven by $45.2 million higher personnel-related cost due to restructuring charges in the current period, increased performance-based variable compensation and additional headcount from business acquisitions, $12.3 million higher advertising and marketing expenses to support our new product introductions, and a $4.9 million non-recurring credit for change in fair value of contingent consideration from an acquisition recorded in fiscal year 2018. 
 Net income for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 was $112.8 million and $215.5 million, respectively, compared to $80.8 million and $174.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017.
Trends in Our Business
We believe our future growth will be determined by our ability to rapidly create innovative products across multiple digital platforms, including gaming, digital music devices, video and computing. The following discussion represents key trends specific to our market opportunities.
Business Seasonality, Product Introductions and Acquisitions
Critical Accounting Estimates
Other than the recent accounting pronouncement adoptions discussed below and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies discussed in Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no substantial changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies during the nine months ended December 31, 2018, compared with the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASU 2014-09" or “Topic 606”) which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under ASC 605 (“Topic 605”), Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. Under the new guidance, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard requires reporting companies to disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. On April 1, 2018, we adopted the new standard and all related amendments using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of April 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after March 31, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with historic accounting standards under Topic 605. Refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details of the impact of adoption of Topic 606.
transfers until the transferred asset is sold to an unrelated party or recovered through use. However, this standard does not apply to intra-entity transfer of inventory. We adopted this standard effective April 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis, and the adoption of ASU 2016-16 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recent accounting pronouncements to be adopted.
Impact of Constant Currency
Sales are net sales and the sales growth discussion and sales growth rate percentages are in U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise specified.
Sales Denominated in Other Currencies
Although our financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a portion of our sales was generated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, such as the Euro, Chinese Renminbi, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Taiwan New 
Dollar, British Pound and Australian Dollar. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, approximately 50% of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. 
Net Sales
Net Sales by Region
The increase in net sales in our EMEA region for the three-month and nine-month periods presented above was primarily driven by growth in Gaming, Video Collaboration, Keyboards and Combos, Pointing Devices, PC Webcams, and Tablet and Other Accessories, partially offset by a decline in sales for Mobile Speakers and Smart Home. 
The increase in net sales in our Asia Pacific region during the three-month and nine-month periods presented above was primarily driven by growth in Gaming, Keyboards and Combos, Video Collaboration, and Pointing Devices, partially offset by a decline in sales for Mobile Speakers. 
Net Sales by Product Categories
Pointing Devices
Net sales of Pointing Devices increased 6% and 5% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase for both periods was primarily driven by an increase in sales for cordless mice, led by strong contribution from MX Vertical Wireless Mouse introduced in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. Increases in sales for MX Master 2S Wireless Mouse and B220 Silent Mouse also contributed to the sales increase for both periods.
Our PC Webcams category comprises PC-based webcams targeted primarily at consumers.
PC Webcams net sales increased 21% and 13% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase in both periods was primarily driven by increases in sales of our HD Pro Webcam C920 and 1080P Pro Stream Webcam.
Our Video Collaboration category primarily includes products which combine audio and video and other products that can connect any-sized user groups.
Net sales of Video Collaboration products increased 60% and 49% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase for both periods was primarily driven by an increase in sales for our MeetUp video conference camera, BRIO 4K Pro Webcam, high end business webcams and the introduction of our Rally Ultra-HD PTZ Conference Camera in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. PTZ Pro 2 also contributed to the sales increase for the nine months ended December 31, 2018. 
Our Mobile Speakers category is made up entirely of Bluetooth wireless speakers.
Net sales of Mobile Speakers decreased 35% and 31% for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The decrease for both periods was primarily due to declines in sales for our existing Ultimate Ears speakers. The decrease was partially offset by sales from the introductions of our Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM 3 and BOOM 3 mobile speakers in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. 
Gaming net sales increased 23% and 40% for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase for both periods was primarily driven by an increase in sales of our core PC gaming products, and ASTRO console gaming headsets, which benefited from the growing gaming market, growth in eSports, expansions in new channels and regions, and expansion in product portfolios. The increase for the nine-month period was also driven by the fact that the acquisition of ASTRO closed on August 11, 2017, in the middle of our fiscal year 2018 second quarter, resulting in a partial comparative period impact. The growth in both periods was partially offset by a slight decline in our simulation products.
Our Smart Home category includes our Harmony line of advanced home entertainment controllers and home security cameras.
Operating Expenses
Marketing and Selling
During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, marketing and selling expenses increased $16.1 million and $42.7 million, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year. The increases were primarily driven by higher advertising and marketing expenses to support our new products, and higher personnel-related costs due to increased headcount and increased performance-based variable compensation. 
Research and development expenses consist of personnel and related overhead costs, contractors and outside consultants, supplies and materials, equipment depreciation and facilities costs, all associated with the design and development of new products and enhancements of existing products.
During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, research and development expenses increased $6.2 million and $13.0 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by higher personnel-related costs due to increased headcount from business acquisitions, increased performance-based variable compensation, and higher investment in new product developments.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead, information technology, and facilities costs for the infrastructure functions such as finance, information systems, executives, human resources, and legal.
During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, general and administrative expenses increased $2.2 million in each period, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year. The increase for the three-month period was primarily driven by higher consulting cost from merger and acquisition activities. The increase for the nine-month period was primarily driven by increased performance-based variable compensation. 
Amortization of Intangible Assets and Acquisition-Related Costs 
Amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization of acquired intangible assets, including customer relationships and trade names. The increase in amortization of intangible assets during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 compared with the same periods of the prior fiscal year was primarily driven by the acquisition of ASTRO in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and the acquisition of Blue Microphones in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. Acquisition-related costs include legal expense, due diligence costs, and other professional costs incurred for business acquisitions. 
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration for Business Acquisition
There was no contingent consideration for business acquisition during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018. During the nine months ended December 31, 2017, the fair value of the contingent consideration for business acquisition decreased $4.9 million due to the agreement we reached with the sellers of Jaybird LLC and lower-than-expected net sales of Jaybird products, partially offset by the change in the time value of money. 
Restructuring Charges (Credits), Net
Other Expense, Net 
Investment income (loss) related to a deferred compensation plan represents earnings, gains, and losses on trading investments related to a deferred compensation plan offered by one of our subsidiaries. 
Currency exchange loss, net relate to balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in our subsidiaries, as well as to the sale of currencies, and to gains or losses recognized on currency exchange forward contracts. We do not speculate in currency positions, but we are alert to opportunities to maximize currency exchange gains and minimize currency exchange losses.
against tax credits. Furthermore, in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, there were discrete tax benefits of $0.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively, from the reversal of uncertain tax positions from the expiration of statutes of limitations. In the same periods ended December 31, 2017, the tax benefits from reversal of uncertain tax positions from the expiration of statutes of limitations were $6.0 million and $7.9 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $584.5 million, compared to $641.9 million as of March 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, 63% of the cash and cash equivalents was held in Switzerland, 15% held in Hong Kong and China and 13% held in the United Kingdom. We do not expect to incur any material adverse tax impact except for what has been recognized, or be significantly inhibited by any country in which we do business from the repatriation of funds to Switzerland, our home domicile.
 The decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to the cash paid for the Blue Microphones Acquisition (see Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements), payment of cash dividends, purchases of property, plant and equipment, tax withholdings related to settlements of restricted stock units and the purchases of our shares, partially offset by proceeds from exercises of stock options and purchase rights and net cash provided by operating activities.
As of December 31, 2018, our working capital was $569.5 million, compared to $597.4 million as of March 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by higher accounts payable, higher accruals and lower cash and cash equivalents offset by higher accounts receivable, net and inventories. Our working capital increased by $23.5 million compared to $546.0 million as of December 31, 2017, which was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable, net, inventories and cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by higher accruals. 
We had several uncommitted, unsecured bank lines of credit aggregating $79.4 million as of December 31, 2018. There are no financial covenants under these lines of credit with which we must comply. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding bank guarantees of $30.1 million under these lines of credit. 
DSO for the three months ended December 31, 2018 increased by 11 days to 50 days, as compared to 39 days for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The adoption of Topic 606 negatively impacted our DSO for the three months ended December 31, 2018 by 14 days, mainly as a result of changes in the balance sheet presentation of certain reserve balances previously shown net within accounts receivable which are now presented as liabilities. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have an impact over the total cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities. Refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the details of the adoption impact of Topic 606. Timing of customer payments and claims also decreased DSO by 3 days.
DPO for the three months ended December 31, 2018 remained constant compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2018, we generated $273.4 million of cash from operating activities. Our main sources of operating cash flows were net income after adding back non-cash expenses of depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation expense, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable, net, excluding the impact from the adoption of Topic 606 at the adoption date was primarily due to higher business volumes, timing of sales and customer payments. The increase in inventories was primarily driven by inventories for new product introductions and higher inventory balances to support tariff impact mitigation. We strategically invested in our inventory ahead of the recent tariff implementation. The increase in accounts payable were primarily driven by the higher inventory purchases. The increase in accrued and current liabilities excluding the impact from the adoption of Topic 606 at the adoption date were primarily driven by higher sales reserve liability due to higher business volumes.
Net cash used in investing activities was $165.8 million, primarily due to the $133.9 million payment of the net cash purchase price for the Blue Microphones Acquisition and $28.3 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Net cash used in financing activities was $155.4 million, primarily for the $114.0 million payment of cash dividend, $22.5 million in repurchases of our registered shares, and $29.1 million tax withholdings related to net share settlements of restricted stock units, partially offset by $10.1 million in proceeds received from exercises of stock options and purchase rights.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2018, there was a $9.7 million loss from currency exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents, compared to a gain of $1.7 million during the same period of the prior fiscal year. The loss from currency exchange rate effect during the nine months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to the weakening of the Euro and Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. Dollar by 7% and 8%, respectively, during the period. The gain from currency translation exchange effect during the nine months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar by 12% during the period.
Cash Outlook
In fiscal year 2019, we paid a cash dividend of CHF 110.7 million (U.S. Dollar amount of $114.0 million) out of retained earnings. In fiscal year 2018, we paid a cash dividend of CHF100.0 million (U.S. Dollar amount of $104.2 million) out of retained earnings. Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our shareholders.
The annual bonus is paid in the first quarter of the following fiscal year, and the operating cash flow for that period is negatively affected as a result. 
We lease facilities under operating leases, certain of which require us to pay property taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Operating leases for facilities are generally renewable at our option and usually include escalation clauses linked to inflation. The remaining terms of our non-cancelable operating leases expire in various years through 2030. 
Purchase Commitments
As of December 31, 2018, we had non-cancelable purchase commitments for inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to original design manufacturers, contract manufacturers and other suppliers, the majority of which are expected to be fulfilled within the next 12 months. Non-cancelable purchase commitments for capital expenditures primarily relate to commitments for tooling for new and existing products, computer hardware, leasehold and improvements. We expect to continue making capital expenditures in the future to support product development activities and ongoing and expanded operations. Although open purchase commitments are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us to reschedule or adjust our requirements based on business needs prior to delivery of goods or performance of services. 
Other Contractual Obligations and Commitments
For further detail about our contractual obligations and commitments, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
Guarantees
Logitech Europe S.A., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, guaranteed payments of certain third-party contract manufacturers' purchase obligations. As of December 31, 2018, the maximum amount of this guarantee was $3.8 million.
