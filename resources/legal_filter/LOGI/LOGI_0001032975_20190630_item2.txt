Impact of Constant Currency
References to Sales 
References to “sales” mean net sales, except as otherwise specified, and the sales growth discussion and sales growth rate percentages are based on U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise specified.
Sales Denominated in Other Currencies
Although our financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a portion of our sales was generated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, such as the Euro, Chinese Renminbi, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Taiwan New Dollar, British Pound and Australian Dollar. During the three months ended June 30, 2019, approximately 47% of our sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. 
Net Sales
Sales by Region
The sales in our Asia Pacific region were flat. Growth in Video Collaboration was offset by a decline in sales for Mobile Speakers. 
Sales by Product Categories
Pointing Devices
Our Pointing Devices category comprises PC- and Mac-related mice including trackballs, touchpads and presenters.

Our PC Webcams category comprises PC-based webcams targeted primarily at consumers.
PC Webcams sales decreased 5% in the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in the sales of our HD Pro Webcam C920.
Gaming sales decreased 1% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily driven by declines in the sales of our gaming headsets and console gaming headsets, partially offset by increases in the sales of PC gaming mice and console gaming controllers. 
Our Video Collaboration category primarily includes Logitech’s ConferenceCams, which combines affordable
Sales of Video Collaboration products increased 25% in the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by the sales of our Rally Ultra-HD PTZ Conference Camera introduced in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 and an increase in the sales of our MeetUp video conference camera. 
Our Mobile Speakers category is made up entirely of Bluetooth wireless speakers.
Sales of Mobile Speakers increased 47% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the sales of our Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM 3 and BOOM 3 mobile speakers introduced in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, the sales of our WONDERBOOM 2 
introduced in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and an increase in the sales of Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM, partially offset by declines in the sales for other existing Ultimate Ears speakers. 
Smart Home sales increased 9% during the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the sales of our home video products, partially offset by declines in sales of our Harmony remote products. 
Operating Expenses
Marketing and Selling
Research and Development 
Research and development expenses consist of personnel and related overhead costs, contractors and outside consultants, supplies and materials, equipment depreciation and facilities costs, all associated with the design and development of new products and enhancements of existing products.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead, information technology, and facilities costs for the infrastructure functions such as finance, information systems, executives, human resources, and legal.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, general and administrative expenses decreased $3.3 million, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease for the three-month period was primarily driven by lower personnel-related costs. 
Amortization of Intangible Assets and Acquisition-Related Costs 
Amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization of acquired intangible assets, including customer relationships and trade names. Acquisition-related costs include legal expense, due diligence costs, and other professional costs incurred for business acquisitions. 
The increase in amortization of intangible assets during the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared with the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily driven by the intangible assets acquired through the Blue Microphones acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. 
Restructuring Charges, Net
 During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we implemented a restructuring plan to streamline and realign our overall organizational structure and reallocate resources to support our long-term growth opportunities. In July, 2018, our Board of Directors approved additional costs under this restructuring plan, totaling pre-tax charges of approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million, of which $11.8 million has been recognized cumulatively as of June 30, 2019. The total charges consisted of cash severance and other personnel costs and are presented as restructuring charges, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of June 30, 2019, the Company has substantially completed this restructuring plan. 
Other Income (Expense), Net 
Investment income represents earnings, gains, and losses on trading investments related to a deferred compensation plan offered by one of our subsidiaries. 
Currency exchange gain (loss), net relates to balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in our subsidiaries, as well as to the sale of currencies, and to gains or losses recognized on currency exchange forward contracts. We do not speculate in currency positions, but we are alert to opportunities to maximize currency exchange gains and minimize currency exchange losses.
 The decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the three months ended June 30, 2019, was primarily due to payment of annual bonus during the period, purchases of property, plant and equipment, tax withholdings related to settlements of restricted stock units and shares repurchased under our share buyback program, partially offset by proceeds from exercises of stock options and purchase rights and net cash provided by operating activities.
As of June 30, 2019, our working capital was $648.3 million, compared to $632.6 million as of March 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable, net, higher inventories and lower accrued and other current liabilities, partially offset by lower cash and cash equivalents and higher accounts payable. Our working capital increased by $49.6 million compared to $596.7 million as of June 30, 2018, which was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable, net, higher inventories and lower accounts payable, partially offset by lower cash and cash equivalents and higher accrued and other current liabilities. 
DSO for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased by 2 days to 59 days, compared to 57 days for the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to timing of sales, customer payments and claims.
DPO for the three months ended June 30, 2019 decreased by 5 days, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the timing of purchases and related payments.
ITO for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was approximately unchanged, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. 
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, we generated $36.5 million of cash from operating activities. Our main sources of operating cash flows were from net income, after adding back non-cash expenses of depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation expense, and from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable, net was primarily driven by growth and timing of sales, customer payments and claims. The increase in other assets was primarily due to an increase in right-of-use assets as a result of the adoption of ASC Topic 842. The increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by the timing of purchases and related payments. The decrease in accrued and other liabilities was primarily due to payment of annual bonus during the period, partially offset by an increase in lease liabilities as a result of the adoption of ASC Topic 842.
Net cash used in investing activities was $9.5 million, primarily due to $9.3 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Net cash used in financing activities was $34.1 million, primarily due to $15.1 million used for repurchases of our registered shares, and $19.4 million tax withholdings related to net share settlements of restricted stock units, partially offset by $0.4 million in proceeds received from exercises of stock options and purchase rights.
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, there was a $0.5 million loss from currency exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents, compared to a loss of $7.3 million during the same period of the prior fiscal year. The loss from currency translation exchange effect during the three months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to the weakening of the Euro, Brazilian Real and Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar by 5%, 14% and 4%, respectively, during the period. 
Cash Outlook
In May 2019, the Board of Directors recommended that the Company pay CHF121.8 million ($122.4 million based on the exchange rate on March 31, 2019) in cash dividends out of retained earnings available at the end of fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2019, we paid a cash dividend of CHF 110.7 million (U.S. Dollar amount of $114.0 million) out of retained earnings available at the end of fiscal year 2018. In fiscal year 2018, we paid a cash dividend of CHF100.0 million (U.S. Dollar amount of $104.2 million) out of retained earnings available at the end of fiscal year 2017. The dividend to be paid in fiscal year 2020 and any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our shareholders.
We lease facilities under operating leases, certain of which require us to pay property taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Operating leases for facilities are generally renewable at our option and usually include escalation clauses linked to inflation. The remaining terms of our non-cancelable operating leases expire in various years through 2030. 
Purchase Commitments
As of June 30, 2019, we had non-cancelable purchase commitments for inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to original design manufacturers, contract manufacturers and other suppliers, the majority of which are expected to be fulfilled within the next 12 months. Non-cancelable purchase commitments for capital expenditures primarily relate to commitments for tooling for new and existing products, computer hardware, leasehold and improvements. We expect to continue making capital expenditures in the future to support product development activities and ongoing and expanded operations. Although open purchase commitments are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us to reschedule or adjust our requirements based on business needs prior to delivery of goods or performance of services. 
Other Contractual Obligations and Commitments
