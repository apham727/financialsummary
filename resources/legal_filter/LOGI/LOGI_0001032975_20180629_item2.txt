Summary of Financial Results
Our net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased 15% compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017, due to stronger net sales across all regions.  ASTRO contributed 5 points to the net sales growth during the period. Our net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased 13%, 7% and 28% in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, respectively, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. 
Operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018 were $191.5 million, or 31.5% of net sales, compared to $162.2 million, or 30.6% of net sales, in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by $26.5 million higher personnel-related cost due to restructuring charges in the current period, increased variable compensation linked to stronger performance and additional headcount from prior business acquisitions. 
 Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was $38.5 million, compared to $37.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.

Critical Accounting Estimates
Adoption of New Accounting Guidance
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASU 2014-09" or “Topic 606”) which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under ASC 605 (“Topic 605”), Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. Under the new guidance, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard requires reporting companies to disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. On April 1, 2018, we adopted the new standard and all related amendments using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of March 31, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after April 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with historic accounting standards under Topic 605. 
Refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details of the impact of adoption.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Financial Instruments-Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Subtopic 825-10)" ("ASU 2016-01"). ASU 2016-01 requires entities to measure equity instruments at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value within the statement of operations. We adopted ASU 2016-01 effective April 1, 2018 on a prospective basis for our privately held strategic equity securities without readily determinable fair values. We elected the measurement alternative to record these investments at cost and to adjust for impairments and observable price changes with a same or similar security from the same issuer within the statement of operations. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recent accounting pronouncements to be adopted.
Impact of Constant Currency
Sales Denominated in Other Currencies
Although our financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a portion of our sales was generated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, such as the Euro, Chinese Renminbi, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Taiwan New Dollar, British Pound and Australian Dollar. During the three months ended June 30, 2018, 49% of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.
Net Sales
Net Sales by Region
The increase in net sales in our Americas region was primarily driven by growth in Gaming (including ASTRO), Video Collaboration, Tablets and Other Accessories, Video Collaboration and PC Webcams, partially offset by a decline in sales for Mobile Speakers and Smart Home. 
The increase in net sales in our EMEA region was primarily driven by growth in Gaming (including ASTRO), Video Collaboration, Tablets and Other Accessories, partially offset by a decline in sales for Mobile Speakers and Smart Home. 
The growth in our Asia Pacific region during the period was primarily driven by growth in Gaming, Keyboards and Combos, Video Collaboration and Pointing Devices. 
Net Sales by Product Categories
Net Sales by Product Categories
Pointing Devices
Our Pointing Devices category comprises PC and Mac-related mice, touchpads and presenters.
Net sales of Pointing Devices increased 5% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase for the three-month period was primarily driven by an increase in sales for MX Master 2S Wireless Mouse and the introduction of MX Ergo Wireless Trackball. 
Our PC Webcams category comprises PC-based webcams targeted primarily at consumers.
PC Webcams net sales increased 16% in the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase for the three-month period was primarily driven by an increase in sales for our HD Pro Webcam C920 and 1080P Pro Stream Webcam.
Our Video Collaboration category primarily includes products which combine audio and video and other products that can connect small- and medium-sized user groups.
Net sales of Video Collaboration products increased 65% in the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to strong sales for our Meetup video conference camera, PTZ Pro 2 group camera, and high-end business webcams.
Our Mobile Speakers category is made up entirely of Bluetooth wireless speakers.
Net sales of Mobile Speakers decreased 45% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease for the period was primarily due to a decline in sales for our Ultimate Ears Megaboom, Boom 2, and Wonderboom mobile speakers, partially offset by sales from the introduction of our Ultimate Ears Megablast and Blast mobile speakers in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. 
Gaming net sales increased 75% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The significant increase for the period was primarily driven by the strong performance of console gaming headsets from the acquisition of ASTRO, as well as the continuing success for our gaming mice and PC gaming headsets.
Our Smart Home category includes our Harmony line of advanced home entertainment controllers and home security cameras.
Smart Home net sales decreased 45% during the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in sales for our Harmony Smart Home remotes, which grew approximately 50% a year ago, partially offset by an increase in sales for our Circle 2 wired and wireless security cameras introduced in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.
Gross Profit
Operating Expenses
Marketing and Selling
Marketing and selling expenses consist of personnel and related overhead cost, corporate and product marketing, promotions, advertising, trade shows, customer and technical support, and facilities costs.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, marketing and selling expenses increased $12.2 million compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by $11.1 million higher personal-related costs due to increased variable compensation linked to stronger performance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and increased headcount to expand and support our advertising and marketing efforts for our new products resulting from past business acquisitions.
 Research and Development 
Research and development expenses consist of personnel and related overhead costs for contractors and outside consultants, supplies and materials, equipment depreciation and facilities costs, all associated with the design and development of new products and enhancements of existing products.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, research and development expenses increased $3.9 million compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by $2.8 million higher personnel-related costs due to increased headcount from business acquisitions and increased variable compensation linked to stronger performance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead and facilities costs for the finance, information systems, executives, human resources, and legal functions.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Higher personnel-related costs were partially offset slightly by a reduction in our external consulting expenses. 
Amortization of Intangibles and Acquisition-Related Costs 
Amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization of acquired intangible assets, including customer relationships and trade names. The increase in amortization of intangible assets during the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared with the same period of the prior fiscal year was primarily driven by the acquisition of ASTRO in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. Acquisition-related costs include legal expense, due diligence costs, and other professional costs incurred for business acquisitions. 
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration for Business Acquisition
There was no contingent consideration for business acquisition during the three months ended June 30, 2018. The change in fair value of contingent consideration for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was primarily due to lower-than-expected net sales of Jaybird products, partially offset by the change in the time value of money. 
Restructuring Charges 
Cash Balances, Available Borrowings, and Capital Resources
 The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to purchases of property, plant and equipment, tax withholdings related to settlements of restricted stock units and the purchases of our shares, partially offset by
As of June 30, 2018, our working capital was $596.7 million, compared to $597.4 million as of March 31, 2018. Our working capital increased compared to $553.3 million as of June 30, 2017, which was primarily driven by higher cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net, partially offset by higher accounts payable and higher accruals.
DSO for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased 19 days to 57 days, as compared 38 days for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The adoption of Topic 606, negatively impacted our DSO for the three months ended June 30, 2018 by 17 days, mainly as a result of changes in the balance sheet presentation of certain reserve balances previously shown net within accounts receivable which are now presented as liabilities. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have did not have an impact over the total cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities. Refer to Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the details of the adoption impact of Topic 606. Timing of sales and customer payments also drove the increase in DSO.
DPO for the three months ended June 30, 2018 decreased four days, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the timing of purchases and related payments.
ITO for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was higher, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in inventories compared with June 30, 2017 was primarily driven by higher net sales while inventory level decreased.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, we generated $12.3 million cash in operating activities. Our main sources of operating cash flows were from net income after adding back non-cash expenses of depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation expense, and from in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable, net, excluding the impact from the adoption of Topic 606 was primarily due to timing of sales and customer payments, and the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by the higher inventory purchases.
Net cash used in investing activities was $8.8 million, primarily due to $8.7 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Our expenditures for property, plant and equipment during the three months ended June 30, 2018 decreased by $1.3 million, compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, mainly due to the lower amount of tooling purchases and lower infrastructure expenditure. 
Net cash used in financing activities was $34.0 million, primarily for $10.0 million repurchases of our registered shares, $25.1 million tax withholdings related to net share settlements of restricted stock units partially offset by $1.1 million in proceeds received from the exercises of stock options.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, there was a $7.3 million loss of currency exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents, compared to a gain of $1.1 million during the same period of the prior fiscal year. The loss from currency exchange effect during the three months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to the weakening of the Euro, Brazilian Real and Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar by 5%, 14% and 4%, respectively, during the period. The gain from currency translation exchange effect during the three months ended June 30, 2017 was primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar by 4% during the period.
Cash Outlook
In May 2018, the Board of Directors recommended that the Company pay CHF110.7 million ($115.7 million based on the exchange rate on March 31, 2018) in cash dividends for fiscal year 2018. In fiscal year 2018, we paid a cash dividend of CHF100.0 million (U.S. Dollar amount of $104.2 million) out of retained earnings. During fiscal year 2017, we paid a cash dividend of CHF 90.2 million (U.S. Dollar amount of $93.1 million) out of retained earnings. During fiscal year 2016, we paid a cash dividend of CHF 83.1 million (U.S. Dollar amount of $85.9 million) out of retained earnings. 
The annual bonus is paid in the first quarter of the following fiscal year, and the operating cash flow for that period is negatively affected as a result. 
We lease facilities under operating leases, certain of which require us to pay property taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Operating leases for facilities are generally renewable at our option and usually include escalation clauses linked to inflation. The remaining terms of our non-cancelable operating leases expire in various years through 2030. 
Purchase Commitments
As of June 30, 2018, we had non-cancelable purchase commitments for inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to original design manufacturers, contract manufacturers and other suppliers, the majority of which are expected to be fulfilled within the next 12 months. Non-cancelable purchase commitments for capital expenditures primarily relate to commitments for tooling for new and existing products, computer hardware, leasehold and improvements. We expect to continue making capital expenditures in the future to support product development activities and ongoing and expanded operations. Although open purchase commitments are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us to reschedule or adjust our requirements based on business needs prior to delivery of goods or performance of services. 
Other Contractual Obligations and Commitments
For further detail about our contractual obligations and commitments, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
Guarantees
Logitech Europe S.A., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, guaranteed payments of two third-party contract manufacturers' purchase obligations. As of June 30, 2018, the maximum amount of this guarantee was $3.8 million, of which $1.2 million of guaranteed purchase obligations were outstanding.
