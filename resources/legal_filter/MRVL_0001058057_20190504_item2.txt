In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, our net revenue increased year over year by 9.6% from $604.6 million net revenue in the first quarter fiscal 2019 compared with $662.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
The increase was primarily due to increased sales of our networking products by 40% with sales benefiting from our acquisition of Cavium.
As we enter the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we are monitoring the near term geopolitical uncertainty and the recent ban on shipments to Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (“Huawei”).
Subsequent to quarter end, on May 6, 2019, we announced our intent to acquire Aquantia, Corp. (“Aquantia”), a publicly traded company.
It is a manufacturer of high speed transceivers which includes copper and optical physical layer products.
Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we will pay Aquantia's stockholders $13.25 per share in cash.
This represents approximately $452 million in transaction value after adjusting for net cash on Aquantia's balance sheet.
We intend to finance the transaction with cash on hand and borrowings from our revolving credit facility.
The transaction is expected to close by the end of December 2019, subject to regulatory approval as well as other customary closing conditions, including the adoption by Aquantia's stockholders of the merger agreement.
The acquisition of Aquantia complements our portfolio of copper and optical physical layer product offerings and extends our position in the Multi-Gig 2.5G/5G/10G Ethernet segments.
In particular, Aquantia's multi-gig automotive PHYs, coupled with our industry-leading gigabit PHY and secure switch products, creates an advanced range of high-speed in-car networking solutions to enable automotive networking with speeds necessary to enable level 4 and 5 autonomous driving.
Subsequent to quarter end, on May 20, 2019, we announced our intent to acquire Avera Semiconductor (“Avera”), the application specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) business of GlobalFoundries Inc. (“GlobalFoundries”).
This acquisition brings together Avera's leading custom design capabilities with our advanced technology platform and scale, creating a leading ASIC supplier for wired and wireless infrastructure.
The agreements include transfer of Avera's revenue base, strategic design wins with leading infrastructure original equipment manufacturers, and a new long-term wafer supply agreement between GlobalFoundries and us.
We will pay GlobalFoundries $650 million in cash at closing plus an additional $90 million in cash if certain business conditions are satisfied within the next 15 months.
The transaction is expected to close by January 2020 pending receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
Subsequent to the quarter end, on May 29, 2019, we announced our intent to sell our wi-fi connectivity business to NXP for $1.76 billion in cash.
The divestiture encompasses our wi-fi and bluetooth technology portfolios and related assets.
The business employs approximately 550 people worldwide and generated approximately $300 million in revenue in our fiscal 2019.
This transaction has been approved by the board of directors of NXP and our board of directors and is expected to close by March 2020, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
Capital Return Program.
We remain committed to delivering shareholder value through our share repurchase and dividend programs.
On October 16, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $700 million addition to the balance of our existing share repurchase plan.
Under the program authorized by our Board of Directors, we may repurchase shares in the open-market or through privately negotiated transactions.
The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
As of May 4, 2019, there was $904 million remaining available for future share repurchases.
For the three months ended May 4, 2019, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of our common stock for $50.0 million.
As of May 4, 2019, a total of 294.8 million shares have been repurchased to date under the Company’s share repurchase programs for a total $3.9 billion in cash.
We returned $89.5 million to stockholders in the three months ended May 4, 2019, including our repurchases of common stock and $39.5 million of cash dividends.
Cash and Short Term Investments.
Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $571.9 million at May 4, 2019, which was slightly lower than our balance at our fiscal year ended February 2, 2019 of $582.4 million.

Sales and Customer Composition.
Net revenue attributable to significant customers whose revenue as a percentage of net revenue was 10% or greater of total net revenue is presented in the following table:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



*Less than 10% of net revenue



We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of our major customers and distributors and believe the distributors’ sales to diverse end customers and geographies further serve to mitigate our exposure to credit risk.
Sales shipped to customers with operations in Asia represented approximately 80% of our net revenue in the three months ended May 4, 2019, and approximately 94% of net revenue in the three months ended May 5, 2018, respectively.
Because many manufacturers and manufacturing subcontractors of our customers are located in Asia, we expect that most of our net revenue will continue to be represented by sales to our customers in that region.
Customers can generally cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty.

Results of Operations



The following table sets forth information derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenue:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Three months ended May 4, 2019 and May 5, 2018 



Net Revenue



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Our net revenue for the three months ended May 4, 2019 increased by $57.8 million compared to net revenue for the three months ended May 5, 2018.
This was primarily due to increased sales of our networking products by 40% with sales benefiting from our acquisition of Cavium.
This increase was partially offset by decreased sales of our storage products and other products, which were down 12% and 2% respectively, compared to the three months ended May 5, 2018.
In the three months ended May 4, 2019, unit shipments were 50% lower and average selling prices increased 41% compared to the three months ended May 5, 2018.
The US government export restrictions on Huawei were implemented in the second week of our second quarter of fiscal year 2020, limiting revenue from that customer to shipments during a short period during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.

Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was higher for the three months ended May 4, 2019 compared to the three months ended May 5, 2018.
The increase primarily consisted of $60 million of amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets from our acquisition of Cavium.
As a result, gross margin for the three months ended May 4, 2019 decreased 7.5 percentage points compared to the three months ended May 5, 2018.
Research and Development



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Research and development expenses increased by $90.1 million in the three months ended May 4, 2019 compared to the three months ended May 5, 2018.
Selling, general and administrative



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $37.7 million in the three months ended May 4, 2019 compared to the three months ended May 5, 2018.
The increase was primarily due to additional costs from our acquisition of Cavium, including $19.8 million of intangibles amortization expense, $18.2 million of higher employee personnel-related costs, $3.3 million of higher depreciation and amortization expense, $3.0 million of higher facility-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $5.6 million of lower merger-related costs.
Restructuring Related Charges



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



28

We recognized $5.7 million of total restructuring related charges in the three months ended May 4, 2019 as the Company continues to evaluate its existing operations to increase operational efficiency, decrease costs and increase profitability.
See “Note 9 - Restructuring and Other Related Charges” for further information.
Interest Income



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Interest income decreased by $4.8 million in the three months ended May 4, 2019, compared to the three months ended May 5, 2018.
The decrease is primarily due to the sale of investments in fiscal 2019.
Interest Expense



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Interest expense increased by $21.0 million in the three months ended May 4, 2019, compared to the three months ended May 5, 2018.
The increase is primarily due to interest expense incurred resulting from the issuance of our 2023 Notes, 2028 Notes and amounts borrowed under our credit agreement.
Other Income (Loss), Net



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Other income (loss), net, was a loss of $0.1 million in the three months ended May 4, 2019, compared to a gain of $1.5 million in the three months ended May 5, 2018.
This was primarily due to the foreign currency gain related to the revaluation of foreign currency denominated tax liabilities in the three months ended May 5, 2018.
Provision (benefit) for Income Taxes



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



29

Our income tax expense for the three months ended May 4, 2019 was $7.3 million compared to tax expense of $3.8 million for the three months ended May 5, 2018.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended May 4, 2019 and May 5, 2018 differs from the statutory Federal rate of 21% and 35%, respectively, primarily due to non-U.S. earnings that are taxed at a substantially lower tax rate.
In June 2018, we executed debt agreements to obtain a $900 million term loan and $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in order to fund the Cavium acquisition.
In addition, we executed a debt agreement in June 2018 to obtain a $500 million Revolving Credit Facility, which was undrawn as of May 4, 2019.
See “Note 8 - Debt” for further information.
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations, and funds from our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements and any declared dividends, repurchase of our common stock and commitments for at least the next twelve months.
Additional equity financing or convertible debt financing may be dilutive to our current shareholders.
In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common shares.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities



Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the three months ended May 4, 2019 was $165.8 million.
We had a net loss of $48.5 million adjusted for the following non-cash items: share-based compensation expense of $58.6 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $79.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $44.3 million, deferred income tax expense of $4.4 million, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and debt discounts of $1.7 million, and $5.3 million net loss from other non-cash items.
Cash inflow from working capital of $20.3 million for the three months ended May 4, 2019 was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts receivable and inventories and an increase in accrued employee compensation, slightly offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities.
The decrease in accounts receivable and inventories was driven primarily by collection of payments during the quarter as well as lower inventory in response to lower sales.
The increase in accrued employee compensation is due to increases in employee stock purchase plan accruals and accrued salaries.
Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the three months ended May 5, 2018 was $128.8 million.
We had net income of $128.6 million, adjusted for the following non-cash items: depreciation and amortization of $20.3 million, share-based compensation expense of $23.9 million and $1.7 million net loss from other non-cash items.
Cash outflow from working capital of $45.7 million for the three months ended May 5, 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accrued compensation.
This outflow was offset by an increase in accrued liabilities.
The increase in accounts receivable was driven primarily by an increase in DSO from 45 to 50 days.
The decrease in accrued compensation was mainly driven by a decrease in our bonus accrual due to our annual bonus payout during the three months ended May 5, 2018.
The increase in accrued liabilities was driven by an increase in variable consideration as a result of our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities



Net cash used in investing activities was $21.0 million for the three months ended May 4, 2019 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $216.7 million for the three months ended May 5, 2018.

For the three months ended May 5, 2018, net cash provided by investing activities of $216.7 million was primarily driven by net proceeds for sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities and time deposits of $274.1 million, offset by purchases of available-for-sale securities and time deposits of $38.5 million and purchases of property and equipment of $13.6 million.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities



For the three months ended May 4, 2019, net cash used in financing activities of $155.3 million was primarily attributable to $50.0 million repayment of debt, $48.0 million for repurchases of our common stock, $39.5 million for payment of our quarterly dividends, $28.8 million tax withholding payments on behalf of employees for net share settlements, and $15.3 million payments for technology license obligations.
These outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $31.1 million from employee stock plans.
For the three months ended May 5, 2018, net cash used in financing activities of $66.7 million was primarily attributable to $29.8 million for payment of our quarterly dividends, $23.9 million tax withholding payments on behalf of employees for net share settlements, and $20.5 million payments on technology license obligations.
These outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $11.1 million from employee stock plans.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
