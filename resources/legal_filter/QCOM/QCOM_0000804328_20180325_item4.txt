The Company has also agreed to pay customary fees to each of BNP and Barclays in connection with the BNP Letter of Credit and the Barclays Letter of Credit, respectively. If an event of default under a Letter of Credit occurs and is not cured or waived, any unpaid fees outstanding under such Letter of Credit may be declared immediately due and payable.
