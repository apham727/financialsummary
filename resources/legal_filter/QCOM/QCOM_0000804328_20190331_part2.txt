 On July 26, 2018, we announced a new repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $30 billion of our common stock. We did not repurchase any of our shares in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. At March 31, 2019, $7.8 billion remained authorized for repurchase. The stock repurchase program has no expiration date. 
In September 2018, we entered into three accelerated share repurchase agreements (ASR Agreements) to repurchase an aggregate of $16 billion of our common stock. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, 178.4 million shares were initially delivered to us under the ASR Agreements and retired. Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreements, the final number of shares and the average purchase price will be determined at the end of the purchase periods, which are scheduled to occur in early September 2019 but may occur earlier in certain circumstances. 
Not applicable.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
