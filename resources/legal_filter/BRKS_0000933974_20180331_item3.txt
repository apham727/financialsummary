 Item 3.
Interest Rate Exposure  



 Our term loan bears variable interest rates which subjects us to interest rate risk.
Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in the short-term LIBOR rate, the federal funds effective rate and the prime rate.
As of March 31, 2018, the weighted average stated interest rate on the term loan was 4%.
At March 31, 2018, the outstanding term loan principal balance was $199.5 million, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs of $2.6 million.
During the six months ended March 31, 2018, we incurred interest expense of $2.0 million on the term loan.
A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a $0.5 million change in interest expense incurred during the six months ended March 31, 2018.
Our cash and cash equivalents consist principally of money market securities that are short-term in nature.
A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in $0.3 million increase in interest income earned during the six months ended March 31, 2018.
Currency Rate Exposure  



 We have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in Euros, British Pounds and a variety of Asian currencies.
Sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were approximately 29% and 38% of our total sales, respectively, during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
Such balances were approximately $150.5 million and $51.6 million, respectively, at March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, and related to the Euro, British Pound and a variety of Asian currencies.
We also utilize forward contracts to mitigate our exposures to currency movement.
We incurred foreign currency losses of $2.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, which related to the currency fluctuation on these balances between the time the transaction occurred and the ultimate settlement of the transaction.
A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates at March 31, 2018 and 2017 would result in an approximate change of $2.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in our net income during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
