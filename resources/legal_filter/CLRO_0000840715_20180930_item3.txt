ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 



An evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2018 was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Principal Financial and Accounting Officer.
Management identified a material weakness in the operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting relating to the accurate and timely reporting of its financial results and disclosures and its testing and assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner.
To address the material weakness, management is working with our third party internal controls consultant to assist with the implementation of a remediation plan which will supplement the existing controls.
The material weakness will be fully remediated when, in the opinion of management, the control processes have been operating for a sufficient period of time to provide reasonable assurance as to their effectiveness.
The remediation and ultimate resolution of the material weakness will be reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Except as noted above, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
