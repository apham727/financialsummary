Forward Looking Statements  



 This report includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
The Company operates in a rapidly changing business, and new risk factors emerge from time to time.
The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Financial Overview  



 Net sales increased 13%, or $4.9 million, to $43.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, compared to $39.0 million for the same period in 2017.
Gross profit was $6.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, compared to $6.6 million in the prior year.
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased 9%, or $0.5 million, to $5.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same period last year.
Separation expenses were $2.4 million related to the resignation of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
The Company incurred a net loss of $1.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 compared to net income of $1.3 million during the prior year.
The net loss was primarily attributable to separation expenses related to the departure of the Company’s former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Diluted loss per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 was $0.25, compared to diluted income per share of $0.28 for the same period in 2017.
Net income excluding the impact of the separation expenses, net of taxes, was $0.9 million (non-GAAP, see discussion of Non-GAAP financial measures below), compared to $1.3 million in the prior year.
On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation.
Revenue  



 The Company adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with customers using the full retrospective method effective January 1, 2018.
See Note 5 to the accompanying financial statements for further information.
The Company makes estimates regarding performance obligations inherent in the products and services it sells including, whether ongoing maintenance obligations performed by third party vendors are distinct from the related software licenses, and allocation of sales prices among distinct performance obligations.
These estimates require significant judgement to determine whether the software’s functionality is dependent on ongoing maintenance or if substantially all functionality is available in the original software download.
We also use judgement in the allocation of sales proceeds among performance obligations, utilizing observable data such as stand-alone selling prices, or market pricing for similar products and services.
Allowance for Accounts Receivable  



 The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.
Management determines the estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable by considering a number of factors, including: historical experience, aging of the accounts receivable, and specific information obtained by the Company on the financial condition and the current creditworthiness of its customers.
If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
At the time of sale, we record an estimate for sales returns based on historical experience.
If actual sales returns are greater than estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred.
Accounts Receivable – Long Term  



 The Company’s accounts receivable long-term are discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates at the time of sale based on prevailing rates.
In doing so, the Company considers competitive market rates and other factors.
At times the Company sells receivables to a financial institution on a non-recourse basis.
The net proceeds from such sales are included in the operating section of the statement of cash flows as changes in accounts receivable.
Inventory Allowances  



 The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-offs may be required.
In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.
Share-Based Payments  



 Under the fair value recognition provision, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
We record the impact of forfeitures when they occur.
Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  



  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, superseding the previous revenue recognition requirements for contracts, along with most existing industry-specific guidance.
In March, April, May and December 2016, the FASB issued additional updates to the new accounting standard which provide supplemental adoption guidance and clarifications.
The guidance requires an entity to review contracts in five steps: 1) identify the contract, 2) identify performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price, and 5) recognize revenue in order to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company adopted the new standard on January 1, 2018, using the full retrospective method which required us to restate our historical financial information to reflect the adoption as of the earliest reporting period presented.
The most significant impact of adopting the standard relates to the determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent in the sale of third party security software and software that is highly interdependent with support, as well as maintenance, support and other services.
See Footnote 5 (Revenue Recognition).
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02").
ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease guidance under FASB ASC Topic 840, Leases, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases.
ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.
Leases will be classified as either finance or operating leases with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of earnings.
This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018.
Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) ("ASU No.
2016-13").
ASU No.
2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded.
ASU No.
2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach.
The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No.
2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements, particularly its recognition for accounts receivable.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (“ASU 2016-15”) which reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.
The new standard is effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2018.
The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.” This amendment is intended to improve accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
In accordance with this guidance, an entity should recognize the income tax

consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
The ASU is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2019.
Early adoption is permitted in fiscal 2018 with modified retrospective application.
The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-09, “Scope of Modification Accounting”, to reduce diversity in practice and provide clarity regarding existing guidance in ASC 718, “Stock Compensation”.
The amendments in this updated guidance clarify that an entity should apply modification accounting in response to a change in the terms and conditions of an entity’s share-based payment awards unless three newly specified criteria are met.
This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
The new guidance was effective for the Company on a prospective basis beginning on January 1, 2018 and did not impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as it is not the Company’s practice to change either the terms or conditions of stock-based payment awards once they are granted.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements.
The amendments in this update also make certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current U.S. GAAP.
ASU No.
2017-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years; the ASU allows for early adoption in any interim period after issuance of the update.
The Company is currently assessing the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
tax reform”) from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Retained earnings.
This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted and must be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to periods in which the effects of the TCJA are recognized.
The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05, Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (SEC Update), Income Taxes (Topic 740).
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company has not recognized any material changes to the provisional amounts recorded in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K in connection with the 2017 Tax Act.
We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include net sales, gross margin, adjusted gross billings, gross profit as a percentage of gross billings, net income as a percentage of net sales, net income as a percentage of gross billings, and net income excluding separation expenses, net of taxes.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 We define adjusted gross billings as net sales in accordance with U.S. GAAP, adjusted for the cost of sales related to Software – security and highly interdependent with support and Maintenance, support and other services.
We provided a reconciliation of Adjusted gross billings to net sales, which is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.
In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate Adjusted gross billings of product and services or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.

 We use Net income excluding separation payments as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into comparison of our businesses profitability when compared to the prior year.
In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate separation expenses net of tax, or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2017  



 Net Sales  



 Net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 increased 13%, or $4.9 million, to $43.9 million, compared to $39.0 million for the same period in 2017.
Adjusted gross billings for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 increased 13%, or $13.6 million, to $116.6 million, compared to $103.0 million for the same period in 2017.
Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 increased $3.0 million, or 8% to $38.3 million, compared to $35.3 million for the same period a year earlier.
The increase was due primarily to growth in sales penetration for several of our more significant product lines, as well as the addition of several new product lines.
While the tenure of our vendor relationships is generally for multiple years, the distribution agreements themselves are short term in nature and vendors consolidate or change their relationships for various reasons.
We operate in a competitive market in which vendor distribution and sales agreements are subject to turnover due to competitive bidding processes and other factors.
Adjusted gross billings for the Lifeboat Distribution segment increased $6.3 million or 7% to $102.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
TechXtend segment net sales increased $2.0 million or 52% to $5.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, compared to $3.7 million for the prior year.
The increase was primarily due to several larger enterprise sales during the current period compared to the second quarter of 2017.
Adjusted gross billings for the TechXtend segment increased $7.3 million or 100% to $14.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, we relied on two key customers for a total of 34.5% of our net sales.
One major customer accounted for 18.4% and the other for 16.1%, of our total net sales during the three months ended June 30, 2018.
These same customers accounted for 32.3% and 8.4%, of total net accounts receivable as of June 30, 2018.
Gross Profit  



 Gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 decreased slightly to $6.5 million, compared to $6.6 million for the same period in 2017.
Vendor rebates decreased due to the termination of one of our distribution agreements by a vendor that paid a rebate based on sales.
TechXtend segment gross profit increased 27% to $1.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 compared to $1.0 million for the same period in the prior year due to the increased net sales from the large enterprise sales discussed above.

 Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 was 14.8% compared to 16.8% in 2017.
Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit margin was 13.8% for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, compared to 15.9% in 2017.
TechXtend segment gross profit margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 was 21.9%, compared to 26.1% in 2017.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018 approximately 8.7 percent of our net sales was attributable to security, maintenance and third-party service products which are recorded on a net basis, or an effective 100% gross profit margin, compared to 10.5% in 2017.
This shift in product mix had the effect of reducing gross profit as a percent of net sales by 170 basis points.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  



 SG&A expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 increased $0.5 million, or 9%, to approximately $5.3 million when compared to the same period in 2017.
The increase is primarily due to$ 0.2 million in increased accounting, legal and public company costs.
SG&A expenses were 12.1% of net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, compared to 12.4% for the same period in 2017.
We plan to continue to expand our investment in information technology and marketing, while monitoring SG&A expenses closely.
Separation Expense  



 Separation expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 was $2.4 million compared to no expense in the same period in 2017.
The increase is due to $2.4 million in separation expenses related to the resignation of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on May 11, 2018, consisting of a $1.7 million charge for accelerated vesting of restricted stock and $0.8 million in accrued payments to be made over the next twelve months.
Income Taxes  



 For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.1 million, compared to $0.6 million for the same period in 2017.
The company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was impacted by limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation resulting from section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and adjustments to the accrual for state income taxes in states which have enacted economic nexus statutes.
The Company recorded a $0.4 million tax benefit related to separation expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2018 which were accounted for as a discrete item, resulting in a 18% effective tax benefit rate on that expense.
The effective tax rate for ordinary income was 24.1% for the three months ending June 30, 2018, compared to 32.0% during the same period in the prior year.
As we collect and prepare necessary data and interpret the TCJA and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts.
The accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will be completed in 2018.

or $25.9 million, to $241.7 million, compared to $215.8 million for the same period in 2017.
Adjusted gross billings increased at a higher rate than net sales primarily due to a higher percentage of sales being comprised of maintenance and Software-security and highly interdependent with support which are recorded on a net basis.
Lifeboat Distribution segment net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased $6.0 million, or 9% to $75.2 million, compared to $69.2 million for the same period a year earlier.
The increase was due primarily to growth in sales penetration for several of our more significant product lines, as well as the addition of several new product lines.
The increases were partially offset by turnover in some vendor and customer accounts.
Adjusted gross billings for the Lifeboat Distribution segment increased $20.9 million or 10% to $221.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
TechXtend segment net sales increased $1.4 million or 17% to $9.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $7.9 million for the prior year.

Adjusted gross billings for the TechXtend segment increased $5.0 million or 32% to $20.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Adjusted gross billings increased at a higher rate than net sales because of a higher percentage of our sales being derived from maintenance, service and subscriptions which are recorded on a net basis.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we relied on two key customers for a total of 43.2% of our gross billings.
One major customer accounted for 22.0% and the other for 17.1%, of our total net sales during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
These same customers accounted for 32.3% and 8.4%, of total net accounts receivable as of June 30, 2018.
Gross Profit  



 Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased 1% or $0.1 million, to $13.4 million, compared to $13.3 million for the same period in 2017.
Lifeboat Distribution segment gross profit was unchanged at $11.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 as the impact of decreased gross profit margins offset increases in net sales.
TechXtend segment gross profit increased 3% or $0.1 million to $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the same period in the prior year, due to the higher sales discussed above.

 Separation Expense  



 Separation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $2.4 million compared to no expense in the same period in 2017.
The increase is due to $2.4 million in separation expenses related to the resignation of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on May 11, 2018, consisting of a $1.7 million charge for accelerated vesting of restricted stock and $0.8 million in accrued payments to be made over the next twelve months.
Income Taxes  



 For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the we recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.6 million or 55.0% of income, compared to $1.2 million or 32.0% of income for the same period in 2017.

The effective tax rate for ordinary income was 24.1% for the six months ending June 30, 2018.
As we collect and prepare necessary data and interpret the TCJA and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts.
The accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will be completed in 2018.
Liquidity and Capital Resources  



 Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $4.9 million to $10.4 million at June 30, 2018 from $5.5 million at December 31, 2017.
The increase in cash was primarily the result of $7.8 million in cash provided by operating activities offset by $2.5 million of cash used for stock repurchases and dividends.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $7.8 million, comprised of net income adjusted for non-cash items of $3.2 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $4.6 million.
The increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in net working capital (accounts receivable, inventory, and vendor prepayments less accounts payable) resulting from the utilization of vendor prepayments made in the prior year and reduced long term accounts receivable.
In the six months ended June 30, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million, compared to $0.3 million in the prior year.
Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 of $2.5 million was comprised of $1.5 million of dividend payments on our Common Stock, and $1.0 million for the stock repurchases.
On November 15, 2017, the Company entered into a $20,000 revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with Citibank, N.A.
(“Citibank”) pursuant to a Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Loan Note (the “Note”), Second Amended and Restated Security Agreement (the “Security Agreement”) and Second Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement (the “Pledge Agreement”).
The Credit Facility, which will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, matures on August 31, 2020, at which time the Company must pay all outstanding principal of all outstanding loans plus all accrued and unpaid interest, and any interest, fees, costs and expenses, if any.
As of June 30, 2018, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility.

 Table of Contents  



 We anticipate that our working capital needs will increase as we invest in the growth of our business.
We believe that the funds held in cash and cash equivalents and our unused borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next 12 months.
Contractual Obligations as of June 30, 2018 are summarized as follows:
