Controls and Procedures



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we evaluated under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management.
Our disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting.
Management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



On May 29, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Microsemi which operated under its own set of systems and internal controls.
