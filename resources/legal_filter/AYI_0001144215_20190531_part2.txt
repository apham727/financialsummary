Supplemental Deferred Saving Plan (“SDSP”) maintained for the benefit of certain executive officers and certain other members of senior management of the Company.

Participants may elect to receive the actuarial equivalent of the incremental benefit in the form of a lump sum cash payment.
(ii)A modified benefit (“Modified Accrued Benefit”) was provided for eligible employees who first become a participant on or after September 1, 2019, and who have been both an active employee and an eligible participant in the Acuity Brands, Inc. 2005 Supplemental Deferred Savings Plan for a period of at least 10 years.
The Modified Accrued Benefit provides for a monthly benefit payable for 180 months commencing at age 60 (or following retirement thereafter) equal to 2.8% of the participant's "average annual compensation" multiplied by his years of credited service not to exceed 10 years, divided by 12.
