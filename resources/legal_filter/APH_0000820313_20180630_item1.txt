Note 2—New Accounting Pronouncements  



 Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  



 Revenue Recognition  



 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”, and collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”).
Topic 606 supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance and requires entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services.
The Company adopted Topic 606 as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.
Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 were not retrospectively adjusted, as such results were recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policy discussed under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s 2017 Annual Report.
For a nominal portion of our contracts where the accounting did change, the adoption of Topic 606 resulted in an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings of approximately $3.2 as of January 1, 2018.
For these contracts, we now recognize revenue over time as control of the goods transfers, rather than when the goods are delivered, and title, risk and reward of ownership are passed to the customer, as under previous guidance.
6  



 Table of Contents  



 The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date and as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.
Refer to Note 3 herein for further discussion regarding revenue recognition and related policies.
Other Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  



 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017‑07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017‑07”), requiring employers to provide more details about the components of costs related to retirement benefits.
Specifically, ASU 2017‑07 requires employers to report the service costs for providing pensions to employees in the same line item as other employee compensation costs, while requiring other pension-related costs, such as interest costs, amortization of pension-related costs from prior periods, and the gains or losses on plan assets, to be reported separately and outside of the subtotal of operating income.
ASU 2017‑07 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
The Company adopted ASU 2017‑07 in the first quarter of 2018, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017‑09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting (“ASU 2017‑09”), which provides guidance to determine which changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718.
ASU 2017‑09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, and requires prospective application to changes in terms or conditions of awards occurring on or after the adoption date.
The Company adopted ASU 2017‑09 in the first quarter of 2018, which did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018‑05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
Previously, ASC 740 did not directly address incomplete accounting for the effects of a change in tax laws or rates.
Refer to Note 14 herein for further details regarding the Tax Act.
Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted  



 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016‑02”), which amends, among other things, the existing guidance by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets (right-of-use) and liabilities (for reasonably certain lease payments) arising from operating leases on the balance sheet.
For leases with a term of twelve months or less, ASU 2016‑02 permits an entity to make an accounting policy election to recognize such leases as lease expense, generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, which clarified various aspects of the guidance under ASU 2016-02.
ASU 2016‑02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
Originally, entities were required to adopt ASU 2016-02 using a modified retrospective approach, which required prior periods to be presented under this new standard with various practical expedients allowed.
However, in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which now allows entities the option of recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption (January 1, 2019) while continuing to present all prior periods under previous lease accounting guidance.
The Company continues to review and implement the necessary changes to our existing policies, processes and controls, as well as implementing a new lease management 



 7  



 Table of Contents  



system that will facilitate the adoption of this new standard and ensure all requirements are met for both reporting and disclosure purposes.
The actual impact of the standard will be dependent upon the Company’s lease portfolio at adoption.
The Company is also currently evaluating which transition approach will be used upon adoption.
ASU 2018-02 only applies to the effects of the Tax Act and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
ASU 2018-02 may be applied either in the period of adoption or on a retrospective basis to any period in which the impacts of the Tax Act are recognized.
Note 3—Revenue Recognition  



 Prior to the adoption of Topic 606, the Company’s revenue recognition policy was in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replaced certain related policies discussed under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (in Item 7) and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (in Note 1) of the Company’s 2017 Annual Report.
The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
The following is a summary of the Company’s revenue recognition and related accounting policies and disclosures resulting from the adoption of Topic 606.
For each contract, the promise to transfer the control of the products, each of which is individually distinct, is considered to be the identified performance obligation.
As part of the consideration promised in each contract, the Company evaluates the customer’s credit risk.
Our contracts do not have any significant financing components, as payment terms are generally due net 30 to 120 days after delivery.
Although products are almost always sold at fixed prices, in determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund (due to returns) or adjustment (due to volume discounts, rebates, or price concessions) to determine the net consideration we expect to be entitled to.
We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price.
Based on the respective contract terms, most of our contracts’ revenues are recognized either (i) upon shipment based on free on board (“FOB”) shipping point, (ii) when the product arrives at its destination or (iii) when the product is pulled from consignment inventory.
For the contracts recognized over time, we typically record revenue using the input method, based on the materials and labor costs incurred to date relative to the contract’s total estimated costs.
This method reasonably depicts when and as control of the goods transfers to the customer, since it measures our progress in producing the goods, which is generally commensurate with this transfer of control.
Since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy 



 8  



 Table of Contents  



our performance obligations, we do not have significant contract assets or contract liabilities related to our contracts with customers recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Since our performance obligations are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected not to disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations as of June 30, 2018.
The Company maintains a reserve for unprocessed and estimated future price adjustment claims and returns as a refund liability.
The reserve is recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period that the related revenue is recorded and is calculated based on an analysis of historical claims and returns over a period of time to appropriately account for current pricing and business trends.
These reserves were not significant upon the adoption of Topic 606 nor were they significant in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2018.
Warranty  



 Standard product warranty coverage which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreed-upon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment is typically offered, while extended or separately-priced warranty coverage is typically not offered.
The warranty claim is generally limited to a credit equal to the purchase price or a promise to repair or replace the product for a specified period of time at no additional charge.
Contract assets represent unbilled receivables, which generally arise when revenue recognized over time exceed amounts billed to customers.
Contract liabilities represent billings or advanced consideration received from customers in excess of revenue recognized to date.
As the Company’s performance obligations are typically less than one year, these amounts are generally recorded as current in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets within Other current assets or Other accrued expenses as of June 30, 2018.
Contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were not significant both at the date of adoption and as of June 30, 2018.
Capitalized contract costs to obtain a contract or to fulfill a contract that are not accounted for under other existing accounting standards are recorded as either other current or long-term assets on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the expense, and are generally amortized consistent with the timing of when transfer of control of the related goods occurs.
Such capitalized contract costs were not significant both at the date of adoption and as of June 30, 2018, and the related amortization expense was not significant for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.

 Note 5—Reportable Business Segments  



 The Company has two reportable business segments: (i) Interconnect Products and Assemblies and (ii) Cable Products and Solutions.
The Company organizes its reportable business segments based upon similar economic characteristics and business groupings of products, services and customers.
These reportable business segments are determined based upon how the Company reviews its businesses, assesses operating performance and makes investing and resource allocation decisions.
The Cable Products and Solutions segment primarily designs, manufactures and markets cable, value-add products and components for use primarily in the broadband communications and information technology markets as well as certain applications in other markets.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those for the Company as a whole and are described herein and in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s 2017 Annual Report.
The Company evaluates the performance of business units on, among other things, profit or loss from operations before interest, headquarters’ expense allocations, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, amortization related to certain intangible assets and nonrecurring gains and losses.
The segment results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:

During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 3.1 million shares of its common stock for $263.4 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.
These treasury shares have been retired by the Company, accordingly common stock and retained earnings were reduced.
From July 1, 2018 to July 27, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 0.4 million additional shares of its common stock for $34.8, leaving approximately $1,701.8 available to purchase under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program.
Contingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock.
The following table summarizes the declared quarterly dividends per share as well as the dividends declared and paid for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:   



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.19 to $0.23 per share effective with dividends declared in the second quarter of 2018.
Note 7—Earnings Per Share  



 Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common shares outstanding, which relates to stock options.
A reconciliation of the basic weighted average common shares outstanding to diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

 Excluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive common shares of 1.5 million and 1.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 0.9 million and 1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies  



 The Company has been named as a defendant in several legal actions arising from normal business activities.
Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.
Note 9—Stock-Based Compensation  



 For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s income before income taxes was reduced for stock-based compensation expense of $13.3 and $12.3, respectively.

In addition, for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized aggregate income tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation of $10.8 and $35.1, respectively, which include the excess tax benefits from option exercises of $7.1 (or $0.02 per share) and $29.2 (or $0.09 per share), respectively.
Stock-based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures, which are adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates.
Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods.
Stock Options  



 In May 2017, the Company adopted the 2017 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries (the “2017 Employee Option Plan”).
A committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has been authorized to grant stock options pursuant to the 2017 Employee Option Plan.
The number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (“Common Stock”) reserved for issuance under the 2017 Employee Option Plan is 30,000,000 shares.
As of June 30, 2018, there were 16,947,280 shares of Common Stock available for the granting of additional stock options under the 2017 Employee Option Plan.
The Company also continues to maintain the 2009 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries, as amended (the “2009 Employee Option Plan”).
No additional stock options will be granted under the 2009 Employee Option Plan.
The 2000 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries, as amended, expired in May 2011 and all options granted thereunder have been either exercised or forfeited.
Options granted under the 2017 Employee Option Plan and 



 14  



 Table of Contents  



the 2009 Employee Option Plan generally vest ratably over a period of five years from the date of grant and are generally exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant.
In 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Stock Option Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the “2004 Directors Option Plan”).
The 2004 Directors Option Plan is administered by the Company’s Board of Directors.
The 2004 Directors Option Plan expired in May 2014, except that its terms continue with respect to outstanding options granted thereunder.
Options were last granted under the 2004 Directors Option Plan in May 2011.
Options granted under the 2004 Directors Option Plan are fully vested and are generally exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant.

 15  



 Table of Contents  



 As of June 30, 2018, the total compensation cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized was approximately $165.9 with a weighted average expected amortization period of 3.75 years.
The grant-date fair value of each option grant under the 2009 Employee Option Plan, the 2017 Employee Option Plan and the 2004 Directors Option Plan is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The grant-date fair value of each share grant is determined based on the closing share price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of the grant.
The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
Use of a valuation model for option grants requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
Expected share price volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the Common Stock and implied volatility derived from related exchange traded options.
The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option and expected exercise and historical post-vesting termination experience.
The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issuances with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
The expected annual dividend per share is based on the Company’s dividend rate.
Restricted Shares  



 In 2012, the Company adopted the 2012 Restricted Stock Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the “2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan”).
The 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan is administered by the Company’s Board of Directors.
As of June 30, 2018, the number of restricted shares available for grant under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan was 109,695.
Restricted shares granted under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan generally vest on the first anniversary of the grant date.
Grants under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan entitle the holder to receive shares of the Company’s Common Stock without payment.
Restricted share activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was as follows:  



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 As of June 30, 2018, the total compensation cost related to non-vested restricted shares not yet recognized was approximately $1.1 with a weighted average expected amortization period of 0.88 years.
Note 10—Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits  



 The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans (the “U.S.
Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company.
The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory.
Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans.
Certain foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “International Plans” and, together with the U.S. Plans, the “Plans”).
The following is a summary, based on the most 



 16  



 Table of Contents  



recent actuarial valuations of the Company’s net cost for pension benefits, of the Plans and other postretirement benefits for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:   



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 As a result of the adoption of ASU 2017‑07, the Company records service costs in the same line item as the respective employee compensation costs and within operating income, while all other pension-related costs including interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost and amortization of net actuarial losses are reported separately within Other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
In January 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 to fully fund the U.S. Plans, and estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, cash contributions to the Plans will aggregate approximately $90.0 in 2018.
This voluntary cash contribution made in the first quarter of 2018 is reflected as cash used in operating activities within Net change in accrued pension and postretirement benefits in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.
Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements.
The Company matches the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation.
During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company provided matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans of approximately $4.3 and $3.2, respectively.
Note 11—Acquisitions  



 In the past twelve months, the Company has completed several acquisitions, including three acquisitions which closed in the first six months of 2018, all in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment.
The Company is in the process of completing its analyses of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The Company anticipates that the final assessments of values will not differ materially from the preliminary assessments.
In the second quarter of 2017, the Company incurred approximately $4.0 ($3.7 after-tax) of acquisition-related expenses related to external transaction costs.

 Note 12—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  



 The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment were as follows:  



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 Other than goodwill noted above, the Company’s intangible assets as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were as follows:  



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 Intangible assets are included in Intangibles, net and other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The amortization expense for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $11.9 and $12.0, respectively.
The amortization expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $23.8 and $24.0, respectively.
As of June 30, 2018, amortization expense relating to the Company’s current intangible assets estimated for the remainder of 2018 is approximately $23.2 and for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately $42.9 in 2019, $37.2 in 2020, $32.5 in 2021, $24.9 in 2022 and $22.2 in 2023.
Note 13—Debt  



 The Company’s debt (net of any unamortized discount) consists of the following:  



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 Revolving Credit Facility  



 The Company has a $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which matures March 2021 and gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR.
The Company may utilize the Revolving Credit 



 18  



 Table of Contents  



Facility for general corporate purposes.
At June 30, 2018, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
The carrying value of any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility would approximate their fair value due primarily to their market interest rates and would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 15).
The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants.
At June 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Commercial Paper Programs  



 The Company has a commercial paper program (the “U.S.
Commercial Paper Program”) pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (“U.S.
Commercial Paper” or “USCP Notes”) in one or more private placements in the United States.
The maturities of the USCP Notes vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue.
The USCP Notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at a discount from par, or, alternatively, may be sold at par, and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.
The maximum aggregate principal amount of the USCP Notes outstanding under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program at any time is capped at $2,000.0.
The average interest rate on the U.S. Commercial Paper as of June 30, 2018 was 2.37%.
On July 10, 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the wholly owned subsidiary may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States.
The maturities of the ECP Notes will vary, but may not exceed 183 days from the date of issue.
The ECP Notes will be sold under customary terms in the euro-commercial paper market and may be issued at par or a discount therefrom or a premium thereto and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.
The maximum aggregate principal amount of the ECP Notes outstanding under the Euro Commercial Paper Program at any time is capped at $2,000.0.
The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S.
Dollars or other currencies.
Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Programs may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time.
The Company’s Board of Directors’ authorization for the ECP Notes currently limits the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, ECP Notes, and any other commercial paper, euro-commercial paper or similar programs at any time to $2,000.0.
The Commercial Paper Programs are rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and are backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility, as amounts undrawn under the Company’s existing Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay Commercial Paper, if necessary.
Net proceeds of the issuances of the Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.
The Commercial Paper is classified as long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets since the Company has the intent and ability to refinance the Commercial Paper on a long-term basis using the Revolving Credit Facility.
The Commercial Paper is actively traded and is therefore classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 15).
The carrying value of Commercial Paper borrowings approximated their fair value.

 All of the Company’s outstanding senior notes (“Senior Notes”), listed in the table above, are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness.
Interest on each series of Senior Notes is payable semiannually.
The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of senior notes at any time subject to certain terms and conditions, which include paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase and, with certain exceptions, a make-whole premium.
The fair value of each series of Senior Notes is based on recent bid prices in an active market and is therefore classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 15).
The 2.55% Senior Notes are due in January 2019 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2018.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering our Provision for income taxes by approximately $7.1 and $29.2, respectively, and lowering our effective tax rate by approximately 100 basis points and 470 basis points, respectively.
These three components were provisional amounts recorded in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
The Company did not make any adjustments to the Tax Act Charge in the first six months of 2018.
The Company paid its first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0 in the second quarter of 2018.
The Company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit.

 Note 15—Fair Value Measurements  



 Fair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
These requirements establish market or observable inputs as the preferred source of values.
Assumptions based on hypothetical transactions are used in the absence of market inputs.
The Company does not have any non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.
The valuation techniques required are based upon observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions.
These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:  



 Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
Level 3 Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.
The Company believes that the assets or liabilities subject to such standards with fair value disclosure requirements are short-term investments and derivative instruments.
Substantially all of the Company’s short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit with original maturities of twelve months or less and as such, are considered as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy as they are traded in active markets for identical assets.
The carrying amounts of these instruments, the majority of which are in non-U.S. bank accounts, approximate their fair value.
The Company’s derivative instruments represent foreign exchange rate forward contracts, which are valued using bank quotations based on market observable inputs such as forward and spot rates and are therefore classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The impact of the credit risk related to these financial assets is immaterial.
The amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with foreign exchange rate forward contracts and the amount reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to foreign exchange gain (loss) in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income during the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were not material.
The fair values of the forward contracts are recorded within Other current assets, Intangibles, net and other long-term assets, Other accrued expenses or Other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on their value and remaining contractual period.

   (1)    Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 5 of the accompanying financial statements.
(2)    Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year period(s) compared to the same period(s) in the prior year.
Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior periods from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior period net sales.
(3)    Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section.
(4)    Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year periods and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis.
Geographically, sales in the United States in the second quarter of 2018 increased approximately 21% in U.S. dollars ($576.3 in 2018 versus $476.5 in 2017) and 15% organically, compared to the second quarter of 2017, and increased 18% in U.S. dollars ($1,103.3 in 2018 versus $934.3 in 2017) and 12% organically in the first six months of 2018, compared to the first six months of 2017.
Foreign sales in the second quarter of 2018 increased approximately 18% in U.S. dollars ($1,405.1 in 2018 versus $1,190.0 in 2017), 15% in constant currencies and 12% organically, compared to the second quarter of 2017, and increased 20% in U.S. dollars ($2,745.0 in 2018 versus $2,292.3 in 2017), 16% in constant currencies and 13% organically in the first six months of 2018, compared to the first six months of 2017.
The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $39.4 and $102.8, respectively, compared to the same respective periods in 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $236.6 or 11.9% of net sales and $466.6 or 12.1% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to $212.4 or 12.7% of net sales and $414.2 or 12.8% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively.
Administrative expenses represented approximately 4.8% and 4.9% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, and represented approximately 4.9% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2017.
Research and development expenses represented approximately 2.8% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2018, and represented 2.8% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2017.
Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.4% and 4.5% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, and represented approximately 5.1% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2017.

 Operating income was $408.2 or 20.6% of net sales and $785.1 or 20.4% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to $336.2 or 20.2% of net sales and $650.3 or 20.2% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively.
These expenses had an impact on net income of $3.7 or $0.01 per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $340.2 or 20.4% of net sales and $654.3 or 20.3% of net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.
The increase in the Adjusted Operating Margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same respective periods in 2017, was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment.
Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was $419.7 or 22.4% of net sales and $810.9 or 22.3% of net sales, respectively, compared to $348.4 or 22.3% of net sales and $672.4 or 22.2% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively.
Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was $14.7 or 13.2% of net sales and $26.0 or 12.5% of net sales, respectively, compared to $16.0 or 14.9% of net sales and $29.7 or 14.6% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively.
The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to the same respective periods of 2017, was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs.
Interest expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was $26.0 and $50.5, respectively, compared to $23.4 and $42.7 for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively.
The increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher average interest rates associated with the Company’s commercial paper borrowings as well as the senior note issuances in April 2017, along with higher average debt levels used to fund the Company’s dividend and stock buyback programs.
Provision for income taxes for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was at an effective tax rate of 24.7% and 24.5%, respectively.
For the second quarter of 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 80 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.01, and for the first six months of 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 100 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.02.
Provision for income taxes for the second quarter and first six months of 2017 was at an effective tax rate of 20.1% and 21.9%, respectively.
For the second quarter of 2017, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 660 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.07, and for the first six months of 2017, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 470 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.09.
Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was 25.5%, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 was 26.5%, as reconciled in the tables below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results.
Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) were $284.8 and $0.91, respectively, for the second quarter of 2018, compared to $251.5 and $0.80, respectively, for the second quarter of 2017.
Excluding the effect of the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 2, were $281.8 and $0.90, respectively, for the second quarter of 2018, compared to $234.0 and $0.74, respectively, for the second quarter of 2017.
Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) were $550.4 and $1.75, respectively, for the first six months of 2018, compared to $476.4 and $1.51, respectively, for the first six months of 2017.
Excluding the effect of the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, were $543.3 and $1.73, respectively, for the first six months of 2018, compared to $450.9 and $1.43, respectively, for the first six months of 2017.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  



 At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $991.1 and $1,753.7, respectively.
The vast majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2018 is located outside of the United States.
In the second quarter of 2018, the Company paid the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0.
Since the Company’s intention on December 31, 2017 due to the Tax Act changes was to repatriate most of its pre-2018 accumulated earnings over time, it also recorded a provisional foreign and U.S. state and local tax cost related to such repatriation.
In the first six months of 2018, the Company repatriated a significant amount of its foreign accumulated cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and as a result, paid approximately $36.0 of foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, the majority

of which was paid in the second quarter of 2018.
The Company intends to continue to repatriate certain foreign earnings generated prior to 2018.
Cash Flow Summary  



 The following table summarizes the Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, as reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow:  



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 Operating Activities  



 The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths.
Cash flow provided by operating activities was $395.3 in the first six months of 2018 compared to $518.2 in the first six months of 2017.
The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities (“operating cash flow”) for the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 is primarily related to (i) the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fully fund its U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“U.S.
Plans”, and together with its foreign plans, the “Plans”), (ii) certain tax payments made during the first half of 2018 related to the Tax Act of approximately $54.0, including the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0 and payments for foreign and state withholding and income taxes of approximately $36.0 related to foreign cash repatriated during the first half of 2018, along with (iii) a higher usage of cash related to other changes in working capital, all of which were partially offset by an increase in net income in the first six months of 2018.
In the first six months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $185.5, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to an increase in inventories of $80.0, accounts receivable of $44.5 and other current assets of $29.8 and a decrease in accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $44.8, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $13.6.
In the first six months of 2017, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $115.8, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to an increase in inventories and other current assets of $86.4 and $38.8, respectively, and a decrease in income taxes payable of $45.0, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $62.1.
Accounts receivable increased $28.7 to $1,627.3, primarily due to higher sales in the second quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, which were partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at June 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 (“Translation”).
Days sales outstanding at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were approximately 73 days.
Inventories increased $52.9 to $1,159.8, primarily to support expected future sales levels, partially offset by Translation.
Inventory days at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were 78 and 76 days, respectively.
Other current assets increased $46.4 to $243.2, primarily due to the recording of contract assets of $25.5 as of June 30, 2018 as a result of the adoption of Topic 606 as well as an increase in other receivables.
Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $71.4 to $888.2, primarily due to capital additions of $180.1, partially offset by depreciation of $95.9 and Translation.
Goodwill increased $86.0 to $4,128.6, primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to three acquisitions in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that closed during the first six months of 2018, which was partially offset by Translation.
Intangibles, net and other long-term assets decreased $16.4 to $472.1, primarily as a result of amortization related to the Company’s intangible assets.
Accounts payable increased $27.5 to $903.1, primarily as a result of 



 27  



 Table of Contents  



purchasing activity, which was partially offset by payments on outstanding payables and Translation.
Payable days at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were approximately 61 and 60 days, respectively.
Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased $95.2 to $176.8, primarily due to the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in January 2018 to fully fund the Company’s U.S. Plans.
Other long-term liabilities, including deferred taxes, decreased $55.7 to $511.9, primarily as a result of a reduction in deferred foreign and state withholding and income taxes.
The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations and including the first quarter contribution to its U.S. Plans, cash contributions to the Plans will aggregate approximately $90.0 in 2018.
In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash.
The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.
The decrease in Free Cash Flow is primarily related to the decrease in operating cash flow during the first six months of 2018, which was primarily driven by (i) the voluntary cash contribution to fully fund the U.S. Plans of approximately $81.0 in January 2018, (ii) certain tax payments made during the first half of 2018 related to the Tax Act of approximately $54.0, including the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18.0 and payments for foreign and state withholding and income taxes of approximately $36.0 related to foreign cash repatriated during the first half of 2018, and (iii) a higher usage of cash related to other changes in working capital as discussed above, along with an increase in capital expenditures to support certain new customer programs.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 Investing Activities  



 Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, net sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, and acquisitions.
Net cash used in investing activities was $283.1 in the first six months of 2018, compared to $200.5 in the first six months of 2017.
In the first six months of 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $158.8 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $132.6, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $8.3.
In the first six months of 2017, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $199.0 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $99.5, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $98.0.
Financing Activities  



 Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests.
Net cash used in financing activities was $845.9 in the first six months of 2018, compared to $64.7 in the first six months of 2017.
For the first six months of 2018, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $645.4, net repayments of long-term debt of $128.6, dividend payments of $115.5 



 28  



 Table of Contents  



and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $7.1, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $50.7.
For the first six months of 2017, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $399.9, net repayments of commercial paper of $364.1, dividend payments of $98.2, purchases of and distributions to noncontrolling interests of $19.6, and payments of costs related to the issuances of two senior notes of $5.2, partially offset by borrowings related to the issuances of two senior notes in April 2017 of $749.3 and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $73.0.
The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments.
The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity.
The Company’s debt financing includes the use of commercial paper programs, revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.
The Company has a $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which matures March 2021 and gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR.
The Company intends to utilize the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes.
At June 30, 2018, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants.
At June 30, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Pursuant to the terms of the commercial paper program, the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements (the “U.S.
Commercial Paper Program”) in the United States.
The maximum aggregate principal amount of the commercial paper notes that may be outstanding at any time under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program is $2,000.0.
The amount of U.S. commercial paper notes outstanding (“USCP Notes”) as of June 30, 2018 was $1,047.9.
On July 10, 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the wholly owned subsidiary may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, the “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States.
The maximum aggregate principal amount of the ECP Notes outstanding under the Euro Commercial Paper Program at any time is capped at $2,000.0.
Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Programs are borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time.
The Company’s Board of Directors’ authorization for the ECP Notes currently limits the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, ECP Notes, and any other commercial paper, euro-commercial paper or similar programs at any time to $2,000.0.
The Commercial Paper Programs are rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and are backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility, as amounts undrawn under the Company’s existing Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay the Commercial Paper, if necessary.
Net proceeds of the issuances of Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.
The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the “Senior Notes”) as follows:

Liquidity and Cash Requirements  



 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Commercial Paper Programs, the Revolving Credit Facility, and its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand.
The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the issuances of both the 2020 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes in April 2017) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future, including the repayment of the $750.0 outstanding principal amount of 2.55% Senior Notes due January 2019 (the “2.55% Notes”).
The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends, debt service (including the repayment of the 2.55% Notes), payments associated with the Transition Tax (which is payable in annual installments until 2025) and taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings).
The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on

the Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Programs.
The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions.
Environmental Matters  



 Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures  



 In addition to assessing the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company’s financial performance, communicating operating results to the Company’s Board of Directors and assessing related employee compensation measures.
Non-GAAP financial measures related to net sales exclude the impact related to foreign currency exchange and acquisitions.
The non-GAAP financial information contained herein is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures.
The non-GAAP financial measures defined below should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 are included in “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within this Item 2:   



   ·    Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects, that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented.
Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined below, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares as reported in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
·    Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income).
Amphenol’s results are subject to volatility related to foreign currency translation fluctuations.
As such, management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Organic Net Sales Growth (defined below) and Constant Currency Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends.
·    Free Cash Flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities (“operating cash flow” - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), both of which are derived from the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.
Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company, as we believe it is useful for management and investors to assess our ability to generate cash, as well as to assess how much cash can be used to reinvest in the growth of the Company or to return to shareholders through either stock repurchases or dividends.
Management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Constant Currency Net Sales Growth (defined above) and Organic Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company’s policies related to revenue recognition have been updated in accordance with Note 3 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Item 3.
The Company does not have any significant concentration with any one counterparty.
There has been no material change in the Company’s assessment of its sensitivity to foreign currency exchange rate risk since its presentation set forth in Part II, Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in its 2017 Annual Report.
The Company may borrow under its Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Programs.
Any borrowings under the new Euro Commercial Paper Program, entered into in July 2018 as discussed in Note 13 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, may be denominated in foreign currencies, and there can be no assurance that the Company can successfully manage 



 32

these changes in exchange rates, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies for which such borrowings are made.
In addition, any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR, while any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs are subject to floating interest rates.
Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates.
As of June 30, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, while borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs were at an average floating rate of 2.37%.
The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2018, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly.
Item 4.
