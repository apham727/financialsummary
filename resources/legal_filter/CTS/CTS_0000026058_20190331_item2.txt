Overview
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 34.5% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 33.9% in the first quarter of 2018. The improvement was driven mainly by savings related to cost improvements and the manufacturing transition from Elkhart, Indiana, which were partially offset by material cost and wage increases.
Restructuring charges were $2,084 or 1.8% of sales in the first quarter of 2019. The charges were mainly for building and equipment relocation, severance, and travel costs related to the restructuring of certain operations as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring charges were $1,195 or 1.1% of sales in the first quarter of 2018.
Operating earnings were $14,218 or 12.1% of sales in the first quarter of 2019 compared to operating earnings of $13,359 or 11.8% of sales in the first quarter of 2018.
Interest expense decreased mainly as a result of the reduction in debt year-over-year. Interest income decreased due to lower cash balances. Other income in the first quarter of 2019 was principally driven by foreign currency translation gains, mainly due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi during the quarter, which was partially offset by pension expense.
Our effective income tax rate was 20.0% and 24.5% in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared with the same period in 2018, was primarily attributed to tax benefits recorded upon vesting of restricted stock units.
Cash and cash equivalents were $100,708 at March 31, 2019, and $100,933 at December 31, 2018, of which $97,924 and $96,762, respectively, were held outside the United States. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $225 was primarily driven by capital expenditures of $5,325, taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants of $2,637, dividends paid of $1,310 and treasury stock purchases of $849, which were partially offset by cash generated from operating activities of $9,593. Total long-term debt was $50,000 as of March 31, 2019 and $50,000 as of December 31, 2018. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders' equity, was 11.4% at March 31, 2019, compared to 11.7% at December 31, 2018.
Working capital increased by $9,355 during the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to the decrease of accrued payroll and benefits and accrued liabilities.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $9,593 during the first three months of 2019. Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $11,419, depreciation and amortization expense of $5,924, other net non-cash items of $3,395, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $11,145.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the first three months of 2019 was $5,274, driven almost entirely by capital expenditures.
Net cash used in financing activities for the first three months of 2019 was $4,796. These cash outflows were the result of taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants in the amount of $2,637, dividend payments of $1,310, and treasury stock purchases of $849.
On February 12, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated five-year Credit Agreement with a group of banks (the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $300,000, which may be increased by $150,000 at the request of the Company, subject to the administrative agent's approval. This new unsecured credit facility replaces the prior $300,000 unsecured credit facility, which would have expired August 10, 2020. Borrowings of $50,000 under the prior credit agreement were refinanced into the Credit Agreement. The prior agreement was terminated as of February 12, 2019.
The Revolving Credit Facility requires, among other things, that CTS comply with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Failure to comply with these covenants could reduce the borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at March 31, 2019. 
In the third quarter of 2016, we entered into three forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $50,000 of long-term debt for the periods August 2017 to August 2020. The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the swap agreements will be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense when settled.
We have historically funded our capital and operating needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities, supported by available credit under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, we may choose to pursue additional equity and debt financing to provide additional liquidity or to fund acquisitions.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Revenue Recognition
•Identify the contract(s) with a customer
•Identify the performance obligations
•Allocate the transaction price
•Recognize revenue when the performance obligations are met
Product Warranties
Accounts Receivable
•Ongoing credit evaluations of current customers,
•Credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information,
•Adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current credit worthiness,
•An active collection effort by regional credit functions, reporting directly to the corporate financial officers, and;
•Limited credit insurance on the majority of our international receivables.
Inventories
Over the last three years, our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories have ranged from 11.0% to 19.5% of gross inventory. We believe our reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories.
Retirement Plans
Actuarial assumptions are used in determining pension income and expense and our pension benefit obligation. We utilize actuaries from consulting companies in each applicable country to develop our discount rates that match high-quality bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit in order to provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due. After considering the recommendations of our actuaries, we have assumed a discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and a rate of compensation increase in determining our annual pension income and expense and the projected benefit obligation. During the fourth quarter of each year, we review our actuarial assumptions 
Valuation of Goodwill
•Significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value,
•Significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate,
•Adverse action or assessment by a regulator,
•Unanticipated competition,
•More-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of,
•Testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, and
•Allocation of a portion of goodwill to a business to be disposed.
If a quantitative assessment is required, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation methodologies. Determining fair value using a quantitative approach requires significant judgment, including judgments about projected revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital expenditures, and cash flows over a multi-year period. The discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital. In assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values, we evaluate our results against our market capitalization. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impact the goodwill impairment assessment.
Impairment of Other Intangible and Long-Lived Assets
•Significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value,
•Significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business,
•Significant negative industry or economic trends.
If we believe that one or more indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform a recoverability test by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value. During the first quarter we recognized impairment charges of $854 related to the June 2016 Restructuring Plan. No other indicators of impairment were identified during the quarter ended March 31, 2019.

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On February 7, 2019 the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program with a maximum dollar limit of $25 million. This program authorizes us to make repurchases of our common stock from time to time on the open market, but does not obligate us to make repurchases, and has no expiration date. This program replaces the previous plan authorized on April 27, 2015.
