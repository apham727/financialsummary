Overview
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 35.4% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 35.3% in the third quarter of 2017. The improvement from savings related to product line transfers was partially offset by tariff and material cost increases.
Restructuring charges were $997 or 0.8% of sales in the third quarter of 2018. The charges were mainly for building and equipment relocation, severance, and travel costs related to the restructuring of certain operations as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring charges were $1,435 or 1.4% of sales in the third quarter of 2017.
The loss on sale of assets in the third quarter of 2017 was driven by the sale of vacant land adjacent to our Hopkinton, Massachusetts facility in September 2017.
Operating earnings were $16,118 or 13.6% of sales in the third quarter of 2018 compared to operating earnings of $13,111 or 12.3% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2017.
Interest expense decreased mainly as a result of the reduction in debt year-over-year. Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the third quarter of 2018 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi during the quarter.
Research and development expenses were $19,500 or 5.6% of sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $18,432 or 5.9% of sales in the comparable prior year period. Research and development expenses are focused on expanded applications of existing products and new product development as well as current product and process enhancements. 
Restructuring charges were $3,364 or 1.0% of sales in the first nine months of 2018. The charges were mainly for building and equipment relocation, severance, and travel costs related to the restructuring of certain operations as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring charges were $2,942 or 0.9% of sales in the first nine months of 2017.
The loss on sale of assets in 2017 was driven by the sale of vacant land adjacent to our Hopkinton, Massachusetts facility.
Interest expense decreased in the first nine months of 2018 versus the same period of 2017 mainly as a result of the reduction in debt year-over-year. Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the first nine months of 2018 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi during the first nine months of the year.
Our effective income tax rate was 29.7% and 30.0% in the first nine months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, was primarily attributed to the previously mentioned statutory tax rate reduction resulting from the Tax Act, which was partially offset by tax expense related to the one-time cash distribution from Taiwan and higher non-deductible currency losses.
Cash and cash equivalents were $103,754 at September 30, 2018, and $113,572 at December 31, 2017, of which $87,557 and $112,531, respectively, were held outside the United States. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $9,818 was primarily driven by capital expenditures of $20,800 and net long-term debt payments of $26,300, which were partially offset by cash generated from operating activities of $42,560. Total long-term debt was $50,000 as of September 30, 2018 and $76,300 as of December 31, 2017. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, defined as long-term debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholders' equity, was 11.7% at September 30, 2018, compared to 18.2% at December 31, 2017.
Working capital increased by $2,141 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to the increases in accounts receivable and inventory, which were partially offset by the decrease in cash and increase in accounts payable.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $42,560 during the first nine months of 2018. Components of net cash provided by operating activities included net earnings of $28,968, depreciation and amortization expense of $16,349, other net non-cash items of $7,162, and a net cash outflow from changes in assets and liabilities of $9,919.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the first nine months of 2018 was $20,799, driven almost entirely by capital expenditures.
Net cash used in financing activities for the first nine months of 2018 was $31,695. These cash outflows were the result of net long-term debt payments of $26,300, dividend payments of $3,962, and taxes paid on behalf of equity award participants in the amount of $1,433.
On August 10, 2015, we entered into a five-year credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Facility”) with a group of banks in order to support our financing needs. The Revolving Credit Facility originally provided for a credit line of $200,000. On May 23, 2016, we requested and received a $100,000 increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments under the existing credit agreement, which increased the credit line from $200,000 to $300,000. 
The Revolving Credit Facility requires, among other things, that CTS comply with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Failure to comply with these covenants could reduce the borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 30, 2018. 
We use interest rate swaps to convert the Revolving Credit Facility’s variable rate of interest into a fixed rate. In the second quarter of 2012, we entered into four separate interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $50,000 of long-term debt for the periods January 2013 to January 2017. In the third quarter of 2012, we entered into four additional interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $25,000 of long-term debt for the periods January 2013 to January 2017. In the third quarter of 2016, we entered into three additional forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on $50,000 of long-term debt for the periods August 2017 to August 2020. The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the swap agreements will be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense when settled.
We have historically funded our capital and operating needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities, supported by available credit under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, we may choose to pursue additional equity and debt financing to provide additional liquidity or to fund acquisitions.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Revenue Recognition
•Identify the contract(s) with a customer
•Identify the performance obligations
•Allocate the transaction price
•Recognize revenue when the performance obligations are met
Accounts Receivable
•Ongoing credit evaluations of current customers,
•Credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information,
•Adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current credit worthiness,
•An active collection effort by regional credit functions, reporting directly to the corporate financial officers, and;
•Limited credit insurance on the majority of our international receivables.
Inventories
We value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, or net realizable value. We review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements.
Over the last three years, our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories have ranged from 11.2% to 20.1% of gross inventory. We believe our reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories.
Retirement Plans
Actuarial assumptions are used in determining pension income and expense and our pension benefit obligation. We utilize actuaries from consulting companies in each applicable country to develop our discount rates that match high-quality bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit in order to provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due. After considering the recommendations of our actuaries, we have assumed a discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and a rate of compensation increase in determining our annual pension income and expense and the projected benefit obligation. During the fourth quarter of each year, we review our actuarial assumptions in light of current economic factors to determine if the assumptions need to be adjusted. Changes in the actuarial assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations.
Valuation of Goodwill
•Significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value,
•Significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate,
•Adverse action or assessment by a regulator,
•Unanticipated competition,
•More-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of,
•Testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, and
•Allocation of a portion of goodwill to a business to be disposed.
If we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform an impairment test. The test involves comparing the fair values of our reporting units with their carrying values. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, but only to the extent of goodwill recognized. 
The results of these two methods are weighted based upon management's determination. 
If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. This involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
Valuation of Other Intangible and Long-Lived Assets
•Significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value,
•Significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business,
•Significant negative industry or economic trends.
If we believe that one or more indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform a recoverability test by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value. No indicators of impairment were identified as of September 30, 2018.
