Sales were $118,021 in the second quarter of 2018, an increase of $12,335 or 11.7% from the second quarter of 2017. Sales to transportation markets increased $5,185 or 7.5%. Other sales increased $7,150 or 19.3%. The Noliac acquisition, which was completed in May 2017, added $2,508 in sales in the second quarter of 2018 and $1,543 in the second quarter of 2017. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by $1,794 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar depreciating compared to the Euro and Chinese Renminbi and relating mostly to sales of transportation products.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 35.4% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to 33.9% in the second quarter of 2017. Major drivers for the improvement include savings related to product line transfers and favorable foreign exchange impact. The second quarter of 2017 also included costs related to certain production rework issues resolved in the first quarter of 2017.
Research and development expenses were $6,476 or 5.5% of sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $6,049 or 5.7% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2017. Research and development expenses are focused on expanded applications of existing products and new product development as well as current product and process enhancements.
Restructuring charges were $1,172 or 1.0% of sales in the second quarter of 2018. The charges were mainly for building and equipment relocation, severance, and travel costs related to the restructuring of certain operations as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring charges were $729 or 0.7% of sales in the first quarter of 2017.
Operating earnings were $14,544 or 12.3% of sales in the second quarter of 2018 compared to operating earnings of $13,208 or 12.5% of sales in the comparable quarter of 2017 as a result of the items discussed above.
Interest expense decreased mainly as a result of the reduction in debt year-over-year. Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the second quarter of 2018 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro during the quarter.
Our effective income tax rate was 37.7% and 28.4% in the second quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, was primarily attributed to tax expense of $1,703 related to a one-time cash distribution from Taiwan, offset by a reduction in our statutory tax rate as a result of the 2017 Tax and Jobs Act. 
Sales were $231,551 in the six months ended June 30, 2018, an increase of $25,711 or 12.5% from the six months ended June 30, 2017. Sales to transportation markets increased $13,097 or 9.7%. Other sales increased $12,614 or 17.8%. The Noliac acquisition, which was completed in May 2017, added $5,104 in sales in the first half of 2018 and $1,543 in the first half of 2017. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by $4,558 year-over-year due to the U.S. Dollar depreciating compared to the Euro and Chinese Renminbi and relating mostly to sales of transportation products.
Gross margin as a percent of sales was 34.7% in the first half of 2018 compared to 34.0% in the first half of 2017. Major drivers for the improvement include savings related to product line transfers and favorable foreign exchange impact. The first half of 2017 also included costs related to certain production rework issues resolved in the first quarter of 2017.
Research and development expenses were $12,983 or 5.6% of sales in the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to $12,052 or 5.9% of sales in the comparable prior year period. Research and development expenses are focused on expanded applications of existing products and new product development as well as current product and process enhancements. 
Restructuring charges were $2,367 or 1.0% of sales in the first half of 2018. The charges were mainly for building and equipment relocation, severance, and travel costs related to the restructuring of certain operations as part of the 2016 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring charges were $1,507 or 0.7% of sales in the first half of 2017. 
Interest expense decreased in the first six months of 2018 versus the same period of 2017 mainly as a result of the reduction in debt year-over-year. Interest income increased due to higher interest rates. Other expense in the first six months of 2018 was principally driven by foreign currency translation losses, mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Chinese Renminbi and Euro during the first half of the year.
Our effective income tax rate was 30.2% and 29.4% in the first half of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, was primarily attributed to tax expense of $1,703 related to a one-time cash distribution from Taiwan, offset by a reduction in our statutory tax rate as a result of the 2017 Tax and Jobs Act. 
Working capital decreased by $4,283 during the six months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due the decrease in cash and cash equivalents as well as the increase in accounts payable, which were partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory.
Net cash used in investing activities for the first six months of 2018 was $14,909, driven almost entirely by capital expenditures relating to our ongoing ERP project and production line movements.
On August 10, 2015, we entered into a five-year credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Facility”) with a group of banks in order to support our financing needs. The Revolving Credit Facility originally provided for a credit line of $200,000. On May 23, 2016, we requested and received a $100,000 increase in the aggregate revolving credit commitments under the existing credit agreement, which increased the credit line from $200,000 to $300,000. 
The Revolving Credit Facility requires, among other things, that CTS comply with a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Failure to comply with these covenants could reduce the borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at June 30, 2018. 
We have historically funded our capital and operating needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities, supported by available credit under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, we may choose to pursue additional equity and debt financing to provide additional liquidity or to fund acquisitions.
Provisions for estimated warranty expenses related to our automotive products are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using a quoted industry rate. We adjust our warranty reserve for any known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available. We evaluate our warranty obligations at least quarterly and adjust our accruals if it is probable that future costs will be different than our current reserve. 
•Limited credit insurance on the majority of our international receivables.
We reserve for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues. Over the last three years, accounts receivable reserves have been approximately 0.2% to 0.7% of total accounts receivable. We believe our reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio. While credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established, we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience.
We value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method, or net realizable value. We review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements.
Over the last three years, our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories have ranged from 11.9% to 20.1% of gross inventory. We believe our reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories.
Actuarial assumptions are used in determining pension income and expense and our pension benefit obligation. We utilize actuaries from consulting companies in each applicable country to develop our discount rates that match high-quality bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefit in order to provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due. After considering the recommendations of our actuaries, we have assumed a discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and a rate of compensation increase in determining our annual pension income and expense and the projected benefit obligation. During the fourth quarter of each year, we review our actuarial assumptions in light of current economic factors to determine if the assumptions need to be adjusted. Changes in the actuarial assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations.
•Allocation of a portion of goodwill to a business to be disposed.
If we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform an impairment test. The test involves comparing the fair values of our reporting units with their carrying values. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, but only to the extent of goodwill recognized. 
Under the "Income Approach — Discounted Cash Flow Method", the key assumptions include sales, cost of sales, and operating expense projections through the year 2021. These assumptions were determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan and assuming growth rates for revenues, operating expenses, and gross margin assumptions. The fourth key assumption under this approach is the discount rate, which is determined by looking at current risk-free rates, current market interest rates and the evaluation of risk premium relevant to the business segment. If any of our assumptions were to change or were incorrect, our fair value calculation may change, which could result in impairment.
The results of these two methods are weighted based upon management's determination. 
If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. This involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
•Significant negative industry or economic trends.
If we believe that one or more indicators of impairment have occurred, we perform a recoverability test by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value. No indicators of impairment were identified as of June 30, 2018. 
Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On April 27, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an expansion to its repurchase program by authorizing the purchase of an additional $25 million dollars of its common stock in the open market. This authorization has no expiration. As shown in the following table, there were no stock repurchases during the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
