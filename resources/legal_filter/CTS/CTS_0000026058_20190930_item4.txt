Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, management, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2019.
The acquisition of Quality Thermistor, Inc. ("QTI") on July 31, 2019, represents a material change in internal control over financial reporting since managementâ€™s last assessment of our internal control over financial reporting which was completed as of December 31, 2018. The QTI business utilizes separate information and accounting systems and processes. We intend to exclude the operations of QTI from the scope of our Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 report on internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2019.
