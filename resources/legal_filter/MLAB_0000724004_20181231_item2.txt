Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.
General Discussion 



We pursue a strategy of focusing primarily on quality control products and services, which are sold into niche markets that are driven by regulatory requirements.
We are organized into four divisions across nine physical locations.
Our Sterilization and Disinfection Control Division (“SDC” Division) manufactures and sells biological, cleaning, and chemical indicators.
Biological, cleaning, and chemical indicators are used to assess the effectiveness of sterilization and disinfection processes in the hospital, dental, medical device, and pharmaceutical industries.
The division also provides testing and laboratory services, mainly to the dental industry.
Our Instruments Division designs, manufactures, and markets quality control instruments and disposable products utilized in the healthcare, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, medical device, industrial hygiene, and environmental air sampling industries.
Our Cold Chain Monitoring Division designs, develops, and markets systems which are used to monitor various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and differential pressure to ensure that critical storage and processing conditions are maintained in hospitals, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, blood banks, pharmacies, and laboratory environments.
Our Cold Chain Packaging Division provides packaging development consulting services and thermal packaging products such as coolers, boxes, insulation materials, and phase-change products to control temperature during the customer’s transport of their own products.
Our revenues come from three main sources – hardware and software, consumables, and services.
Sterilization and disinfection control products and most products in our Cold Chain Packaging Division are disposable and are used on a routine basis, thus product sales are less sensitive to general economic conditions.
Service demand is driven by our customers’ quality control and regulatory environments, which require periodic repair and recalibration or certification of our instrument products and cold chain monitoring systems.
We typically evaluate costs and pricing annually.
Gross profit is affected by our product mix, manufacturing efficiencies, and price competition.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2018, we completed a business combination (the “Point Six Wireless Acquisition”) whereby we acquired substantially all of the assets (other than current assets) and certain liabilities of Point Six Wireless, LLC’s continuous monitoring business.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2018, we continued to build our infrastructure to prepare for future growth, including completing the relocation and sale of the old Bozeman manufacturing facility, moving those operations into the new Bozeman building, the addition of key personnel to our operations, sales and marketing, and research and development teams, and the continued rollout of phase three of our ERP implementation project (European operations), which was completed as of December 31, 2018.
The worldwide market for sterilization and disinfection control products is growing as more countries focus on verifying the effectiveness of sterilization and disinfection processes.
In general, our instruments products and cold chain monitoring systems are more impacted by general economic conditions than our sterilization and disinfection control and cold chain packaging products.
We are hopeful that we will have enhanced or new products and services available for sale in the coming year.
Overall revenues increased 13 percent and 11 percent for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018.
Organic revenues growth by reporting segment was as follows: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we performed a financial analysis of the Cold Chain Packaging Division, which revealed that gross profits for the segment continue to decline, primarily due to rising commodity costs.
As a result, we performed an impairment test on the reporting segment, and recognized non-cash impairment charges of $1,028 on goodwill and $2,641 on long-lived assets, in impairment loss on goodwill and long-lived assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.

The following tables summarize our revenues by source: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 versus December 31, 2017 



Sterilization and Disinfection Control revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2018 increased nine percent, primarily as a result of six percent organic revenues growth, and to a lesser extent, the acquisition of BAG Health Care GmbH Hygiene Monitoring (“BAG”) during fiscal year 2018.
Sterilization and Disinfection Control revenues increased 12 percent for the nine months ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of BAG, SIMICON GmbH, and Hucker & Hucker GmbH during fiscal year 2018.
Instruments revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 increased 14 percent and eight percent, respectively, primarily due to the timing of orders and modest price increases.
Instrument revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were impacted by a slower than expected adoption of an updated medical product and the discontinuation of its predecessor product.
However, the adoption rate of the product has increased over the past calendar year.
Cold Chain Monitoring revenues increased 15 percent and six percent for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, primarily as a result of organic revenues growth.
Revenues in this division fluctuate quarter over quarter due to the timing of performance obligations and the nature and timing of orders and installations within any given quarter.
Cold Chain Packaging revenues increased 29 percent and 26 percent for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, as a result of the normalization in the order rate of the division’s largest customer.

Gross Profit  



The following summarizes our gross profit by segment: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 versus December 31, 2017 



Sterilization and Disinfection Control gross profit margin percentage increased for both the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 primarily as a result of $150 and $503 of moving expenses related to the Bozeman facility that were incurred during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.
Excluding the impact of the moving expenses, gross margin percentage for both periods was essentially flat as compared to the prior year.
Instruments gross margin percentage was flat during the three months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to product and service mix, offset by volume-based efficiencies associated with an increase in revenues.
Page 21 



Table of Contents  



Cold Chain Monitoring gross profit margin percentage increased during the three months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to $1,700 of inventory reserve expense recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2017; excluding the impact of the reserve in the comparable period, gross margin percentage decreased as a result of timing of orders and unfavorable product mix variations.
Cold Chain Monitoring gross profit margin percentage increased during the nine months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to $1,916 of inventory reserve expense recorded in the nine months ended December 31, 2017.
Excluding the impact of the inventory reserve charge in the comparable period, gross profit margin percentage was flat as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2017.
We are currently implementing a commercial initiative to pass some of our increasing commodities costs on to our customers.
See General Trends for additional discussion.
Operating Expenses 



Operating expenses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 decreased in total as compared to the prior year as follows: 



Selling 



Three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 versus December 31, 2017 



Selling expense is driven primarily by labor costs, including salaries and commissions; accordingly, it may vary with sales levels.
Selling expense increased six percent for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and decreased 17 percent for the nine months ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to timing of the reduction and replacement of selling personnel.
As a percentage of revenues, selling expense was eight percent and seven percent for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, as compared to eight percent and ten percent for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.
We plan to continue to strategically reinvest in sales and marketing resources in an effort to further increase organic revenues growth.
General and Administrative 



Three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 versus December 31, 2017 



Labor costs, including non-cash stock-based compensation, and amortization of intangible assets drive the substantial majority of general and administrative expense.
General and administrative expenses increased $1,475 during the three months ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to increased incentive-based compensation as a result of the Company’s financial performance and higher salary expense.
General and administrative costs increased $3,299 during the nine months ended December 31, 2018, due primarily to increased incentive-based compensation as a result of the Company’s financial performance and increases in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
Research and Development 



Three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 versus December 31, 2017 



Research and development expense is predominantly comprised of labor costs and third-party consultants.
Research and development expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2018 increased 14 percent and for the nine months ended December 31, 2018, decreased nine percent, due to streamlining the necessary engineers, materials, and supplies required to support existing businesses in the prior year.
During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we began to make incremental investments in research and development to enhance existing products.
Impairment Loss on Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets 



Three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 versus December 31, 2017 



During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded impairment expense of $3,669 related to goodwill and long-lived assets associated with our Cold Chain Packaging Division.
During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, we recorded impairment expense of $13,819 related to goodwill associated with our Cold Chain Packaging Division.
See General Trends above for additional discussion.

Estimated Legal Settlement 



Three and nine months ended December 31, 2018 versus December 31, 2017 



During the nine months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $3,300 estimated legal settlement expense; see Note 10.
“Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 1.
Financial Statements.
Other Expense 



Other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2018 is composed primarily of interest expense associated with our Credit Facility.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2018, other expense is composed of interest expense associated with our credit facility, offset by a $288 gain recorded on the sale of our Bozeman facility; see Note 5.
“Facility Relocation” within Item 1.
Financial Statements for more information.
“Income Taxes” within Item 1.
Financial Statements for additional discussion.
The excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with share-based payment awards to our employees have caused and, in the future, may cause large fluctuations in our realized effective tax rate based on timing, volume, and nature of stock options exercised under our share-based payment program.
Net income for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 varied with the changes in revenues, gross profit, and operating expenses (which includes $5,418 and $2,424 of non-cash amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation, respectively).
Net income for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 was also significantly impacted by a $3,669 impairment loss on goodwill and long-lived assets (see Note 3.
“Impairment Loss on Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets” within Item 1.
Financial Statements.
Liquidity and Capital Resources 



Our sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, working capital, capacity under our Credit Facility, and potential equity and debt offerings.
We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term needs.
Our more significant uses of resources have historically included long-term capital equipment expenditures, payment of debt obligations, quarterly dividends to shareholders, and acquisitions.
Working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities.
We had working capital of $11,778 and $14,698 at December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
Given our cash flow projections and unused capacity on our line of credit that is available until March 1, 2022, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements for our general business needs.
Interest-bearing debt of $29,500 and $46,625 was outstanding at December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
The Term Loan requires 20 quarterly principal payments, which began on March 31, 2017, in the amount of $250,000 (increasing by $125,000 each year up to $750,000 in the fifth year).
The remaining balance of principal and accrued interest are due on March 1, 2022.
We were in compliance with all loan agreements at December 31, 2018 and for all prior years presented and have met all debt payment obligations.
Subsequent to December 2018, we made a $3,000 payment under our line of credit.
As of June 30, 2018, our previously-announced move of our Omaha, Traverse City, and old Bozeman manufacturing facilities to our new facility in Bozeman, Montana was complete.
We also completed the sale of our old Bozeman facility during the nine months ended December 31, 2018, which resulted in a gain of $288.
We have recorded an estimated litigation accrual of $3,300, which we expect to pay over the next twelve months; see Note 10.
“Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 1.
Financial Statements.
Future material acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital, assume third party debt or incur other long-term obligations.
At December 31, 2018, we had $68,000 on unused capacity under our line of credit, subject to covenant restrictions.
In addition, in June 2018, the SEC declared effective our Universal Shelf Registration Statement which allows us to sell, in one or more public offerings, common stock or warrants, or any combination of such securities for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to $300,000.
The terms of any offering, including the type of securities involved, would be established at the time of sale.

Dividends 



We have paid regular quarterly dividends since 2003.
We declared and paid dividends of $0.16 per share for the three months ended June 30, 2018, September 30, 2018, and December 31, 2018 as well as each quarter for the year ending March 31, 2018.
In January 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock, payable on March 15, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2019.
Cash Flows 



Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities were as follows (in thousands): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



At December 31, 2018, we had contractual obligations for open purchase orders of approximately $3,823 for routine purchases of supplies and inventory, which are payable in less than one year.
Critical Accounting Estimates 



Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 



We have no derivative instruments and minimal exposure to commodity market risks.
Item 4.
Controls and Procedures 



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 



We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 based on the framework in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013.
Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2018.
