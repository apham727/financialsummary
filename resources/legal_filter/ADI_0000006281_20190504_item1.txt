NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019



(all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts and percentages)



Note 1 – Basis of Presentation



In the opinion of management, the information furnished in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are necessary to fairly state the results for these interim periods and should be read in conjunction with Analog Devices, Inc.’s (the Company) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018) and related notes.
The Company has a 52-53 week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday closest to the last day in October.
Fiscal 2019 is a 52-week fiscal year and fiscal 2018 was a 53-week fiscal year.
The additional week in fiscal 2018 was included in the first quarter ended February 3, 2018.
Therefore, the first six months of fiscal 2019 included one less week of operations as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2018.
As further discussed in Note 2, Revenue Recognition and Note 13, New Accounting Pronouncements, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the earliest period showing, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized as of the date of initial application.
The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 using the full retrospective method and applied the practical expedient, in which the Company is not required to disclose the amount of consideration allocated to any remaining performance obligations or an explanation of when the Company expects to recognize that amount as revenue for all reporting periods presented before the date of the initial application.
As a result of the adoption of ASU 2014-09, the Company changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition and recognizes revenue from product sales to its customers and distributors when title passes, which is generally upon shipment.
See Note 2, Revenue Recognition, in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the details of the Company’s revenue recognition policies.
As shown in the tables below, pursuant to the guidance in ASU 2014-09, the Company restated its historical financial results to be consistent with the standard.
Accordingly, the amounts for all periods presented in this Form 10-Q reflect the impact of ASU 2014-09.

The impact on the Company's previously reported condensed consolidated balance sheet line items is as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740) (ASU 2016-16) using the modified retrospective method with a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings.
ASU 2016-16 requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs.
The adoption of ASU 2016-16 resulted in the following cumulative-effect increase in the Company's deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities and retained earnings as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



See Note 13, New Accounting Pronouncements, and Note 12, Income Taxes, in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the adoption of ASU 2016-16.

Note 2 – Revenue Recognition



Revenue Recognition Policy: In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to achieve a consistent application of revenue recognition, resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Under the new model, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the providing entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
As a result of the adoption of ASU 2014-09, at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company revised its revenue recognition policy.
The Company now recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.
Under ASU 2014-09, the Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (1) the Company has entered into a binding agreement, (2) the performance obligations have been identified, (3) the transaction price to the customer has been determined, (4) the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) the performance obligations have been satisfied.
In those instances, the Company defers the revenue recognized until title has passed.
These measures are used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established.
Estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables.
Contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule.
Performance Obligations: Substantially all of the Company’s contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, the sale of mixed-signal integrated circuit (IC) products.
This performance obligation is satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which occurs upon shipment or delivery.
Unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates and with an original expected duration of one year or less.
As allowed under ASU 2014-09, the Company has opted to not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations as these contracts have original expected durations of less than one year.
The Company generally offers a twelve-month warranty for its products.
The Company’s warranty policy provides for replacement of defective products.
Specific accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues.
Variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that the Company will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period.
Such consideration primarily includes sales made to distributors under agreements that allow certain rights of return, referred to as stock rotation, and credits issued to the distributor due to price protection.
To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions the Company has made based on its historical estimates.
Contract Balances: Accounts receivable represents the Company’s unconditional right to receive consideration from its customers.
Payments are typically due within 30 to 45 days of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component.
To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable.
There were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet in any of the periods presented.

Note 3 – Stock-Based Compensation and Shareholders' Equity



A summary of the Company’s stock option activity as of May 4, 2019 and changes during the three- and six-month periods then ended is presented below:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)In addition to the vested options, the Company expects a portion of the unvested options to vest at some point in the future.
The number of options expected to vest is calculated by applying an estimated forfeiture rate to the unvested options.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



During the three- and six-month periods ended May 4, 2019, the total intrinsic value of options exercised (i.e., the difference between the market price at exercise and the price paid by the employee to exercise the options) was $72.6 million and $99.7 million, respectively, and the total amount of proceeds received by the Company from the exercise of these options was $67.7 million and $86.9 million, respectively.
During the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, the total intrinsic value of options exercised (i.e., the difference between the market price at exercise and the price paid by the employee to exercise the options) was $28.7 million and $82.5 million, respectively, and the total amount of proceeds received by the Company from the exercise of these options was $27.7 million and $65.6 million, respectively.
11



A summary of the Company’s restricted stock unit/award activity as of May 4, 2019 and changes during the three- and six-month periods then ended is presented below: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of May 4, 2019, there was $395.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards comprised of stock options and restricted stock units/awards.
That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.
The total grant-date fair value of shares that vested during the three- and six-month periods ended May 4, 2019 was approximately $87.1 million and $106.4 million, respectively.
The total grant-date fair value of shares that vested during the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018 was approximately $64.1 million and $84.5 million, respectively.
As of May 4, 2019, an additional $2.3 billion remains available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program.
Note 4 – Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)



The following table provides the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) by component and the related tax effects during the first six months of fiscal 2019.
For further information see Note 11, Retirement Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018.
The Company estimates $2.3 million, net of tax, of losses of forward foreign currency derivative instruments included in OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.
There was no material ineffectiveness recorded within OCI related to designated forward foreign currency derivative instruments in the three- and six-month periods ended May 4, 2019 and May 5, 2018.
As of May 4, 2019, the Company held 10 investment securities, 1 of which was in an unrealized loss position with immaterial gross unrealized losses and an aggregate fair value of $25.0 million.
As of November 3, 2018, the Company held 15 investment securities, 15 of which were in an unrealized loss position with immaterial gross unrealized losses and an aggregate fair value of $205.0 million.
These unrealized losses were primarily related to corporate obligations that earn lower interest rates than current market rates.
None of these investments have been in a loss position for more than twelve months.
As the Company does not intend to sell these investments and it is unlikely that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized basis, which will be at maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at May 4, 2019 and November 3, 2018.
Realized gains or losses on investments are determined based on the specific identification basis and are recognized in nonoperating expense (income).
There were no material net realized gains or losses from the sales of available-for-sale investments during any of the fiscal periods presented.
Note 5 – Earnings Per Share



Unvested restricted stock awards that entitle recipients to voting and nonforfeitable dividend rights from the date of grant are considered participating securities and the two-class method is used for purposes of calculating earnings per share.
Under the two-class method, a portion of net income is allocated to these participating securities and therefore is excluded from the 



13



calculation of earnings per share allocated to common stock, as shown in the table below.
The difference between the income allocated to participating securities under the basic and diluted two-class methods is not material.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

Repositioning Action



During the first and second quarters of fiscal 2019, the Company recorded special charges of $20.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively, as a result of organizational initiatives to reposition the Company's global workforce skill set to align with the Company's long-term strategic plan.
Approximately $19.8 million of the total charges for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2019 were for severance and fringe benefit costs in accordance with either the Company's ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements for 140 engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative (SMG&A) employees.
As of May 4, 2019, the Company still employed 68 of the 140 employees included in this action.
These employees must continue to be employed by the Company until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefits.
Closure of Manufacturing Facilities



The Company recorded special charges of $48.7 million on a cumulative basis through May 4, 2019 as a result of its decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation (Linear).
Over the next two to four years, the Company plans to close its Hillview wafer fabrication facility located in Milpitas, California and its Singapore test facility.
In addition, the Company is planning to transition testing operations currently handled in its Singapore facility to its facilities in Penang, Malaysia and the Philippines, in addition to its outsourced assembly and test partners.
The special charges include severance and fringe benefit costs, in accordance with the Company's ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations, and one-time termination benefits for 1,249 manufacturing, engineering and SMG&A employees.
Employees included in this action must continue to be employed by the Company until their employment is terminated in order to receive the severance benefits.
The Company operates and tracks its results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of eight operating segments.
The Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker.
Revenue Trends by End Market



The following table summarizes revenue by end market for the three- and six-month periods ended May 4, 2019 and May 5, 2018.
Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.
Distributors are customers that buy products with the intention of reselling them.
Direct customers are non-distributor customers and consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).
The following tables summarize revenue by channel for the three- and six-month periods ended May 4, 2019 and May 5, 2018:

Note 8 – Fair Value



The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
Level 1 — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2 — Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 — Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
The tables exclude cash on hand and assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value.
As of May 4, 2019 and November 3, 2018, the Company held $233.6 million and $217.6 million, respectively, of cash and held-to-maturity investments that were excluded from the tables below.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(2)



The Company has master netting arrangements by counterparty with respect to derivative contracts.
See Note 9, Derivatives, in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the Company's master netting arrangements.
Deferred compensation plan investments — The fair value of these mutual fund, money market fund and equity investments are based on quoted market prices.
Interest rate derivatives — The fair value of the interest rate derivatives is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the contractual terms of the derivative.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts — The estimated fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which includes derivatives that are accounted for as cash flow hedges and those that are not designated as cash flow hedges, is based on the estimated amount the Company would receive if it sold these agreements at the reporting date taking into consideration current interest rates as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and the Company’s creditworthiness for liabilities.
Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis



The table below presents the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
The carrying amounts of the term loans approximate fair value.
The term loans are classified as Level 2 measurements according to the fair value hierarchy.
The fair values of the senior unsecured notes are obtained from broker prices and are classified as Level 1 measurements according to the fair value hierarchy.
Such exposures result from the portion of the Company’s operations, assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro; other significant exposures include the Philippine Peso, the Japanese Yen and the British Pound.
The contracts are for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions, generally one year or less.
Hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the respective hedges as cash flow hedges and are qualitatively evaluated for effectiveness quarterly.
Derivative instruments are employed to eliminate or minimize certain foreign currency exposures that can be confidently identified and quantified.
As the terms of the contract and the underlying transaction are matched at inception, forward contract effectiveness is calculated by comparing the change in fair value of the contract to the change in the forward value of the anticipated transaction, with the gain or loss on the derivative reported as a component of accumulated OCI in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
The total notional amounts of forward foreign currency derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments of cash flow hedges denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Philippine Pesos and Japanese Yen as of May 4, 2019 and November 3, 2018 was $197.4 million and $194.4 million, respectively.
The fair values of forward foreign currency derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of May 4, 2019 and November 3, 2018 was as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Additionally, the Company enters into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a non-functional currency.
As of May 4, 2019 and November 3, 2018, the total notional amount of these undesignated hedges was $80.6 million and $40.6 million, respectively.
The fair value of these hedging instruments in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets was immaterial as of May 4, 2019 and November 3, 2018.
All the Company’s derivative financial instruments are eligible for netting arrangements that allow the Company and its counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other.
As of May 4, 2019 and November 3, 2018, none of the netting arrangements involved collateral.
19



 The following table presents the gross amounts of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities and the net amounts recorded in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Interest Rate Exposure Management — The Company's current and future debt may be subject to interest rate risk.
The Company utilizes interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce the effects of these changes.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement which locked in the interest rate for up to $1.0 billion in future debt issuances.
The interest rate swap agreement was designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge.
The fair value of this hedge was $51.6 million as of May 4, 2019 and is included within accrued liabilities in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The counterparties to the agreements relating to the Company’s derivative instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings.
Based on the credit ratings of the Company’s counterparties as of May 4, 2019 and November 3, 2018, nonperformance is not perceived to be a material risk.
Furthermore, none of the Company’s derivatives are subject to collateral or other security arrangements and none contain provisions that are dependent on the Company’s credit ratings from any credit rating agency.
While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit risk.
The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the contracts exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties.
The Company records the fair value of its derivative financial instruments in its condensed consolidated financial statements in other current assets, other assets, accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities, depending on their net position, regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the derivative contract.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments are either recognized periodically in earnings or in shareholders’ equity as a component of OCI.
Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same line item on the condensed consolidated statement of income as the impact of the hedged transaction when the underlying contract matures and, for interest rate exposure derivatives, over the term of the corresponding debt instrument.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are reported in earnings as they occur.
For information on the unrealized holding gains (losses) on derivatives included in and reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into the condensed consolidated statement of income related to forward foreign currency exchange contracts, see Note 4, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Note 10 – Debt



The Company has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on July 10, 2020.
The agreement for such revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement) provides that the Company may borrow up to $1.0 billion.
In December 2018, the Company borrowed $75.0 million under this revolving credit facility and utilized the proceeds for the repayment of existing indebtedness and working capital requirements.
The Company repaid the $75 million plus interest of $0.2 million in January 2019.
The Company may borrow under this revolving credit facility in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes.
During the six-month period ended May 4, 2019, the Company made additional principal payments of $350.0 million on its 3-year unsecured term loan.
These amounts were not contractually due under the terms of the loan.
In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a provisional tax benefit of $637.0 million for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates to which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21.0%.
In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a provisional tax expense amount for the one-time transition tax of $691.0 million, which is comprised of the $755.0 million transition tax liability less a deferred tax liability of $64.0 million that was recorded in prior years.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company adjusted its provisional net charge by recording an additional tax benefit of $7.5 million for a change to its estimate for the transition tax due to the finalization of the aggregate foreign cash positions.
118.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740) (ASU 2016-16).
ASU 2016-16 requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs.
ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-16 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method with a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings.
The Company adopted the guidance effective as of November 4, 2018.
The adoption of ASU 2016-16 resulted in a net cumulative-effect adjustment that resulted in an increase in retained earnings of $331.0 million, by recording new deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory, partially offset by a U.S. deferred tax liability related to GILTI.
Adoption of the standard resulted in an increase in long-term deferred tax assets of $1.7 billion and an increase in long-term deferred tax liabilities of $1.3 billion.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company’s Irish tax resident subsidiary received an assessment for fiscal 2013 of approximately €43.0 million, or $48.2 million (as of May 4, 2019), from the Irish Revenue Commissioners (Irish Revenue).
This assessment excludes any penalties and interest.
The assessment claims that the Company’s Irish entity failed to conform to 2010 OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
The Company strongly disagrees with the assessment and maintains that its transfer pricing is appropriate.
The Company intends to vigorously defend its originally filed tax return position and is currently preparing for an appeal with the Irish Tax Appeals Commission, which is the normal process for the resolution of differences between Irish Revenue and taxpayers.
Note 13 – New Accounting Pronouncements



Standards Implemented



Revenue Recognition



In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.
The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The FASB issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard, including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations.
The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the full retrospective method and restated prior periods.
As a result of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 the Company changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition.
See Note 1, Basis of Presentation, and Note 2, Revenue Recognition, in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company's financial statements.
Income Taxes



In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740) (ASU 2016-16).
ASU 2016-16 requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs.
ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-16 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method with a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings.
The adoption of ASU 2016-16 resulted in a net cumulative-effect adjustment that resulted in an increase in retained earnings of $331.0 million, by recording new deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory, partially offset by a U.S. deferred tax liability related to GILTI.
Adoption of the standard resulted in an increase in long-term deferred tax assets of $1.7 billion and an increase in long-term deferred tax liabilities of $1.3 billion.
•ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
•ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.

Standards to Be Implemented



Comprehensive Income



In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2018-02).
ASU 2018-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
ASU 2018-02 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending October 31, 2020 (fiscal 2020).
Leases



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02).
ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize most leases on the balance sheet but recognize expenses on the income statement in a manner similar to current practice.
The update states that a lessee will recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying assets for the lease term.
In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-01, Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842 (ASU 2018-01).
ASU 2018-01 permits an entity to elect an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate land easements that exist or expired before the entity’s adoption of Topic 842 and that were not previously accounted for as leases under Topic 840.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases – Targeted Improvements (Topic 842) (ASU 2018-11), which provides for an additional transition method that allows companies to apply the new lease standard at the adoption date, eliminating the requirement to apply the standard to the earliest period presented in the financial statements.
ASU 2016-02, ASU 2018-01 and ASU 2018-11 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
ASU 2016-02 and ASU 2018-01 are effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-02, ASU 2018-01 and ASU 2018-11 to have a material impact on its results of operations.
Retirement Benefits



In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Topic 715-20): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans (ASU 2018-14), which modifies the disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement plans.
ASU 2018-14 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted.
ASU 2018-14 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending October 30, 2021 (fiscal 2021).
The Company is currently evaluating the adoption date.
Financial Instruments



In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13).
ASU 2016-13 requires a financial asset (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset.
ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.
ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
