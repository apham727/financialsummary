Overview
Acuity Brands is the parent company of Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. (“ABL”) and other subsidiaries (Acuity Brands, ABL, and such other subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the “Company”). The Company has its principal office in Atlanta, Georgia.
The Company does not consider acquisitions a critical element of its strategy but seeks opportunities to expand and enhance its portfolio of solutions, including the acquisition of Lucid Design Group, Inc. (“Lucid”) on February 12, 2018, using cash on hand. Lucid is headquartered in Oakland, California and provides a data and analytics platform to make data-driven decisions to improve building efficiency and drive energy conservation and savings. No acquisitions were completed during fiscal 2017.
The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flows generated primarily from its business operations, cash on hand, and various sources of borrowings. The ability of the Company to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to access certain capital markets, including banks, is necessary to fund its operations and capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase shares, meet its obligations as they become due, and maintain compliance with covenants contained in its financing agreements.
The Company currently expects to invest approximately two percent of net sales in capital expenditures during fiscal 2018. For the first half of fiscal 2018, $20.9 million had been invested, primarily for equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and new and enhanced information technology capabilities. 
In June 2017, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized the repurchase of two million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock in the future. As of February 28, 2018, 1.2 million shares had been purchased under this authorization. In March 2018, the Board authorized the repurchase of six million shares, which includes the remaining 0.8 million shares available for repurchase under the June 2017 authorization. The Company expects to repurchase the shares on an opportunistic basis.
The Company uses available cash and cash flow from operations, as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options, to fund operations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, repurchase Company stock, and pay dividends.
The Company’s cash position at February 28, 2018 was $229.8 million, a decrease of $81.3 million from August 31, 2017. During the six months ended February 28, 2018, the Company generated net cash flows from operations of $178.3 million. Cash generated from operating activities, as well as cash on-hand, was used during the current period primarily to repurchase 1.2 million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock for $194.3 million, to fund acquisitions of $26.4 million, to fund capital expenditures of $20.9 million, to pay dividends to stockholders of $10.9 million, and to pay employee taxes on the net settlement of equity awards of $6.7 million.
The Company generated $178.3 million of cash flow from operating activities during the six months ended February 28, 2018 compared with $90.0 million in the prior-year period, an increase of $88.3 million, due primarily to lower operating working capital requirements and lower variable incentive payments for prior year performance. Operating working capital (calculated by adding accounts receivable plus inventories, and subtracting accounts payable-net of acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes) decreased approximately $26.0 million during the first six months of fiscal 2018 compared to a $22.0 million increase during the first six months of fiscal 2017. Operating working capital during the six months ended February 28, 2018 was favorably impacted by a reduction in inventory, driven primarily by reduced on-hand raw materials and work in process. 
Management believes that investing in assets and programs that will over time increase the overall return on its invested capital is a key factor in driving stockholder value. The Company invested $20.9 million and $35.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily related to investments in new equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and information technology. The Company expects to invest approximately two percent of net sales primarily for new equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and information technology capabilities during fiscal 2018.
Capitalization
The current capital structure of the Company is comprised principally of senior unsecured notes and equity of its stockholders. Total debt outstanding was $356.9 million at February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, and consisted primarily of fixed-rate obligations. 
On December 8, 2009, ABL issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes due in fiscal 2020 (the “Unsecured Notes”) in a private placement transaction. The Unsecured Notes were subsequently exchanged for SEC-registered notes with substantially identical terms. The Unsecured Notes bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum and were issued at a price equal to 99.797% of their face value and for a term of 10 years. See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
On August 27, 2014, the Company executed a revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) with a borrowing capacity of $250.0 million. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on August 27, 2019. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of February 28, 2018. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility as of February 28, 2018. At February 28, 2018, the Company had additional borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility of $244.7 million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the time, which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility less outstanding letters of credit of $5.3 million issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of February 28, 2018, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $10.2 million, primarily for securing collateral requirements under the Company's casualty insurance programs and for providing credit support for the Company’s industrial revenue bond, including $5.3 million issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. See the Debt footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
During the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company’s consolidated stockholders’ equity decreased $29.8 million to $1.64 billion at February 28, 2018, from $1.67 billion at August 31, 2017. The decrease was due primarily to share repurchases, the payment of dividends, shares withheld for employee taxes on vested restricted stock grants, and foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by net income earned in the period, stock issuances resulting primarily from the exercise of stock options, and amortization of pension plan prior service costs and actuarial losses. The Company’s debt to total capitalization ratio (calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total stockholders’ equity) was 17.9% and 17.6% at February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, respectively. The ratio of debt, net of cash, to total capitalization, net of cash, was 7.2% at February 28, 2018 and 2.7% at August 31, 2017.
