Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
During the nine months ended May 31, 2018, the Company completed its acquisitions of IOTA Engineering, LLC (“IOTA”) and Lucid Design Group, Inc (“Lucid”). SEC guidance permits management to omit an assessment of an acquired business' internal control over financial reporting from management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting for a period not to exceed one year from the date of the acquisition. Accordingly, management has not assessed IOTA's or Lucid's internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018. Excluding the acquisitions, there have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s most recent completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.The Company began integrating IOTA and Lucid into its existing control procedures from their respective dates of acquisition. The Company does not anticipate the integration of the acquired companies to result in changes that would materially affect its internal control over financial reporting.
