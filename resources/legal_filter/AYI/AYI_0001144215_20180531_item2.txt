The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flows generated primarily from its business operations, cash on hand, and various sources of borrowings. The ability of the Company to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to access certain capital markets, including banks, is necessary to fund its operations and capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase shares, meet its obligations as they become due, and maintain compliance with covenants contained in its financing agreements.
The Company currently expects to invest approximately 1.5% of net sales in capital expenditures during fiscal 2018. For the first nine months of fiscal 2018, $32.2 million had been invested, primarily for equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and new and enhanced information technology capabilities. 
interest on borrowings as currently scheduled, making required contributions to its employee benefit plans, funding possible acquisitions, and potentially repurchasing up to 5.2 million shares of its outstanding common stock as authorized by the Board. Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its liquidity needs over the next 12 months based on its cash on hand, current projections of cash flow from operations, and borrowing availability under recently executed financing arrangements. Additionally, management believes that the Company’s cash flows from operations and sources of funding, including, but not limited to, future borrowings and capacity, will sufficiently support the long-term liquidity needs of the Company.
During June 2018, the Company entered into a new revolving credit facility and term loan facility. Refer to the Subsequent Events footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The Company expects to invest approximately 1.5% of net sales primarily for new equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and information technology capabilities during fiscal 2018.
The current capital structure of the Company is comprised principally of senior unsecured notes and equity of its stockholders. Total debt outstanding was $358.0 million and $356.9 million at May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017, respectively, and consisted primarily of fixed-rate obligations.

On June 29, 2018, the Company had $90.4 million borrowings outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility and no borrowings under the Term Loan Facility. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of June 29, 2018.

The extent and timing of actual stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including stock price, company performance, expected future market conditions, and other possible uses of cash, including acquisitions. The Company may increase its leverage to accommodate the stock repurchase program.
