Overview
Acuity Brands is the parent company of Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. (“ABL”) and other subsidiaries (Acuity Brands, ABL, and such other subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or similar references). Our principal office is located in Atlanta, Georgia.
We are one of the world’s leading providers of lighting and building management solutions and services for commercial, institutional, industrial, infrastructure, and residential applications throughout North America and select international markets. Our lighting and building management solutions include devices such as luminaires, lighting controls, controllers for various building systems, power supplies, prismatic skylights, and drivers, as well as integrated systems designed to optimize energy efficiency and comfort for various indoor and outdoor applications. Additionally, we continue to expand our solutions portfolio, including software and services, to provide a host of other economic benefits resulting from data analytics that enables the Internet of Things (“IoT”), supports the advancement of smart buildings, smart cities, and the smart grid, and allows businesses to develop custom applications to scale their operations. As of February 28, 2019, we operate 18 manufacturing facilities and eight distribution facilities along with three warehouses to serve our extensive customer base.
On May 1, 2018, using cash on hand and borrowings available under existing credit arrangements, we acquired IOTA Engineering, LLC (“IOTA”). IOTA is headquartered in Tucson, Arizona and manufactures highly engineered emergency lighting products and power equipment for commercial and institutional applications both in the U.S. and internationally.
On February 12, 2018, using cash on hand, we acquired Lucid Design Group, Inc (“Lucid”). Lucid is headquartered in Oakland, California and provides a data and analytics platform to make data-driven decisions to improve building efficiency and drive energy conservation and savings. 
No acquisitions were completed during the first six months of fiscal 2019.
Our principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flows generated primarily from our business operations, cash on hand, and various sources of borrowings. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to access certain capital markets, including banks, is necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase shares, meet obligations as they become due, and maintain compliance with covenants contained in our financing agreements.
For the first six months of fiscal 2019, we paid $24.9 million for property, plant, and equipment, primarily for new and enhanced information technology capabilities, equipment, tooling, and facility enhancements. We currently expect to invest approximately 1.5% of net sales in capital expenditures during fiscal 2019.
In March 2018, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized the repurchase of up to six million shares of the Company's common stock. As of February 28, 2019, 1.2 million shares had been repurchased under this authorization, 
Our short-term cash needs are expected to include funding operations as currently planned; making capital investments as currently anticipated; paying quarterly stockholder dividends as currently anticipated; paying principal and interest on debt as currently scheduled, including our senior unsecured notes maturing in December 2019, which we expect to repay with borrowings available under existing credit arrangements; making required contributions to our employee benefit plans; funding possible acquisitions; and potentially repurchasing shares of our outstanding common stock as authorized by the Board. We believe that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months based on our cash on hand, current projections of cash flow from operations, and borrowing availability under financing arrangements. Additionally, we believe that our cash flows from operations and sources of funding, including, but not limited to, future borrowings and capacity, will sufficiently support our long-term liquidity needs.
Our cash position at February 28, 2019 was $232.0 million, an increase of $102.9 million from August 31, 2018. During the six months ended February 28, 2019, we generated net cash flows from operations of $188.3 million. Cash generated from operating activities, as well as cash on-hand, was used during the six months ended February 28, 2019 primarily to repurchase 0.4 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $48.7 million, fund capital expenditures of $24.9 million, pay dividends to stockholders of $10.5 million, and pay withholding taxes on the net settlement of equity awards of $4.3 million.
We generated $188.3 million of cash flow from operating activities during the six months ended February 28, 2019 compared with $177.6 million in the prior-year period, an increase of $10.7 million, due primarily to lower operating working capital requirements. Operating working capital (calculated by adding accounts receivable plus inventories, and subtracting accounts payable-net of acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes) decreased approximately $35.7 million during the first six months of fiscal 2019 compared to a $26.0 million decrease during the first six months of fiscal 2018 due primarily to greater cash collections from customers year over year, partially offset by increased payments for trade payables.
We believe that investing in assets and programs that will over time increase the overall return on our invested capital is a key factor in driving stockholder value. We paid $24.9 million and $20.9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily related to investments in new information technology, equipment, tooling, and facility enhancements. We expect to invest approximately 1.5% of net sales primarily for new equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and information technology capabilities during fiscal 2019.
Capitalization
Our current capital structure is comprised principally of senior unsecured notes and equity of our stockholders. Total debt outstanding was $356.7 million and $356.8 million at February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018, respectively, and consisted primarily of fixed-rate obligations. 
On December 8, 2009, ABL issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes due in fiscal 2020 (the “Unsecured Notes”) in a private placement transaction. The Unsecured Notes were subsequently exchanged for Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) registered notes with substantially identical terms. The Unsecured Notes bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum and were issued at a price equal to 99.797% of their face value and for a term of ten years. Although the Unsecured Notes will mature within one year from the balance sheet, we have the ability and intent to refinance these borrowings using availability under our unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (“Term Loan Facility”) as described below. Currently, we plan to refinance the Unsecured Notes in full with borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, of which $343.3 million of the carrying value would be due greater than one year from the refinancing date. As such, this amount is reflected within Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of February 28, 2019. See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
On June 29, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks that provides us with a $400.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) and a $400.0 million Term Loan Facility. On February 28, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and no borrowings under the Term Loan Facility. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit 
Agreement as of February 28, 2019. At February 28, 2019, we had additional borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement of $794.7 million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the time, which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility less the outstanding letters of credit of $5.3 million issued on the Revolving Credit Facility. As of February 28, 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $9.5 million, primarily for securing collateral requirements under our casualty insurance programs and for providing credit support for our industrial revenue bond, including $5.3 million issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
During the first six months of fiscal 2019, our consolidated stockholders’ equity increased $85.0 million to $1.80 billion at February 28, 2019, from $1.72 billion at August 31, 2018. The increase was due primarily to net income earned in the period, partially offset by share repurchases, adjustments related to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), and the payment of dividends. Our debt to total capitalization ratio (calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total stockholders’ equity) was 16.5% and 17.2% at February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018, respectively. The ratio of debt, net of cash, to total capitalization, net of cash, was 6.5% and 11.7% at February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018, respectively.
Dividends
Second Quarter of Fiscal 2019 Compared with Second Quarter of Fiscal 2018 
Net sales were $854.4 million for the three months ended February 28, 2019 compared with $832.1 million reported for the three months ended February 28, 2018, an increase of $22.3 million, or 2.7%. For the three months ended February 28, 2019, we reported net income of $66.3 million, a decrease of $30.6 million, or 31.6%, compared with 
$96.9 million for the three months ended February 28, 2018. For the second quarter of fiscal 2019, diluted earnings per share decreased 28.3% to $1.67 compared with $2.33 reported in the year-ago period.
Net Sales
Gross Profit
Operating Profit
Adjusted operating profit increased by $7.1 million, or 6.7%, to $112.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with $105.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Adjusted operating profit margin increased to 13.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with 12.7% for the year-ago period.
Other expense (income) consists principally of net interest expense and net miscellaneous expense, which includes non-service related components of net periodic pension cost, gains and losses associated with foreign currency-related transactions, and non-operating gains and losses. Interest expense, net, was $8.6 million and $8.0 million for the three months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We reported net miscellaneous expense of $1.1 million and $2.8 million for the three months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $30.6 million to $66.3 million from $96.9 million reported for the prior-year period. The decrease in net income resulted primarily from a one-time tax benefit for income taxes related to the TCJA recorded in 2018 that did not recur in the current fiscal year, partially offset by increased operating profit compared to the prior-year period. Diluted earnings per share for the three months ended February 28, 2019 decreased $0.66 to $1.67 compared with diluted earnings per share of $2.33 for the prior-year period. This decrease reflects higher net income tax expense, partially offset by a reduced share count.
Adjusted net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $79.0 million, compared with $78.5 million in the prior-year period, which represented an increase of $0.5 million, or 0.6%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the three months ended February 28, 2019 increased $0.10, or 5.3%, to $1.99 compared with $1.89 for the prior-year period. 
First Six Months of Fiscal 2019 Compared with First Six Months of Fiscal 2018
Net sales were $1.79 billion for the six months ended February 28, 2019 compared with $1.67 billion reported for the six months ended February 28, 2018, an increase of $112.1 million, or 6.7%. For the six months ended February 28, 2019, we reported net income of $145.9 million, a decrease of $22.5 million, or 13.4%, compared with $168.4 million for the six months ended February 28, 2018. For the first six months of fiscal 2019, diluted earnings per share decreased 9.4% to $3.66 compared with $4.04 reported in the year-ago period.
Fiscal 2019 results were impacted by the adoption of ASC 606, which resulted in a decrease to revenues, gross profit, and operating profit of $4.0 million, $2.2 million, and $2.4 million, respectively, during the six months ended February 28, 2019. Additionally, fiscal 2018 results were restated to reflect the impact of adopting ASU 2017-07. Upon adoption of 
ASU 2017-07, our previously reported operating profit and other expense both increased $3.1 million for the six months ended February 28, 2018. The provisions of ASU 2017-07 had no impact to our previously reported net income or earnings per share. See New Accounting Pronouncements footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

Gross Profit
Operating Profit
We recognized a pre-tax special charge of $1.4 million during the first six months of fiscal 2019, compared with a pre-tax special charge of $0.8 million during the first six months of fiscal 2018. Further details regarding our special charges are included in the Special Charge footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Adjusted operating profit increased by $5.7 million, or 2.4%, to $246.5 million for the first six months of fiscal 2019 compared with $240.8 million for the first six months of fiscal 2018. Adjusted operating profit margin for the first six months of fiscal 2019 decreased 60 basis points to 13.8% compared with 14.4% in the year-ago period.
Other expense (income) consists principally of net interest expense and net miscellaneous expense, which includes non-service related components of net periodic pension cost, gains and losses associated with foreign currency-related transactions, and non-operating gains and losses. Interest expense, net, was $17.3 million and $16.1 million for the six months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We reported net miscellaneous expense of $2.4 million and $4.0 million for the six months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Our effective income tax rate was 24.2% and 11.2% for the six months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective income rate for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was significantly impacted by the TCJA, which was enacted during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Further details regarding the TCJA are included in the Income Taxes footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Net income for the first six months of fiscal 2019 decreased $22.5 million to $145.9 million from $168.4 million reported for the prior-year period. The decrease in net income resulted primarily from a one-time tax benefit for income taxes related to the TCJA recorded in 2018 that did not recur in the current fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share for the six months ended February 28, 2019 decreased $0.38 to $3.66 compared with diluted earnings per share of $4.04 for the prior-year period. This decrease reflects higher net income tax expense, partially offset by a reduced share count.
Adjusted net income for the first six months of fiscal 2019 was $171.8 million compared with $160.0 million in the prior-year period, which represented a increase of $11.8 million, or 7.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the six months ended February 28, 2019 increased $0.47, or 12.2%, to $4.31 compared with $3.84 for the prior-year period.
