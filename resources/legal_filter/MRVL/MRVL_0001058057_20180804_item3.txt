Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk. With our outstanding debt following our acquisition of Cavium, we are exposed to various forms of market risk, including the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates on our outstanding Term Loan. See “Note 4 - Debt” for further information. A hypothetical increase or decrease in the interest rate by 1% would result in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense by approximately $3.9 million to $9.1 million. 
 To provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within operating expense, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, our operating expense could increase by approximately 3%.
