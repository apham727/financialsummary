Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk. With our outstanding debt following our acquisition of Cavium, we are exposed to various forms of market risk, including the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates on our outstanding Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility. See “Note 8 - Debt” for further information. A hypothetical increase or decrease in the interest rate by 1% would result in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense by approximately $10.9 million. 
We currently carry debt that relies on the LIBOR as the benchmark rate. LIBOR is expected to be phased out as a benchmark rate by the end of 2021. We expect our debt to continue to use LIBOR until the rate is no longer available or a relevant governmental authority makes a public statement that LIBOR will no longer be available after a certain date. To the extent LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our credit agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate. Currently, there is not a firm timeframe for this change. This update currently has no foreseeable impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements; however, it may have an effect in the future.
 To provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within operating expense, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, our operating expense could increase by approximately 2%.
