Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 



In the first three months of fiscal 2019, we derived approximately 61% of our revenues from customers located outside of the Americas.
The predominant portion of the exchange rate risk associated with our product purchases relates to the New Taiwan Dollar and the Euro.
We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts from time to time to hedge the cash flow risk related to forecasted inter-company sales and purchases denominated in, or based on, foreign currencies (primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling, and New Taiwan Dollar).
We also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies.
We also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment denominated in Euros.
Forward contracts for the sale or purchase of foreign currencies as of January 31, 2019, which are designated as cash flow hedges under FASB guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, were as follows (in thousands, except weighted average forward rates):

We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our investment in net assets in foreign countries.
To manage this risk, we have maintained a forward contract with a notional amount of â‚¬3.0 million.
We designated this forward contract as a hedge of our net investment in Euro-denominated assets.
