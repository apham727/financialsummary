Overview



We are a FORTUNE 500Â® science, engineering and information technology company that provides services and solutions in the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets.
Our domestic customers include the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs and many other U.S. government civilian agencies, as well as state and local government agencies.
We operate in three reportable segments: Defense Solutions, Civil and Health.
Additionally, we separately present the costs associated with corporate functions as Corporate.
Effective the beginning of fiscal 2019, we changed the composition of our Defense Solutions reportable segment to better align the operations within the reportable segment to the customers we serve.
This resulted in the identification of new operating segments within Defense Solutions.
In addition, certain contracts were reassigned between the Civil and Defense Solutions reportable segments.
Business Environment and Trends 



U.S. Government Markets



During the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019, we generated approximately 87% of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. government.
In September 2018, Congress passed and the President signed a consolidated appropriations bill funding the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Health and Human Services for the full government fiscal year ("GFY") 2019.
Earlier in 2018, funding for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Energy as well as funding for Congress were also enacted.
All were funded at increased levels from the previous year.
The remaining seven appropriations bills were operating under a continuing resolution ("CR") until it expired on December 21, 2018.
From the expiration of that CR until the passage of a new CR on January 25, 2019 there was a partial U.S. government shutdown, which reduced or delayed work on existing contracts and caused delays in other government contracting actions and payments.
Prior to the expiration of the January CR, Congress passed appropriations for the seven remaining appropriations bills, thereby completing funding for GFY 2019.
In March 2019, the President submitted the GFY 2020 budget proposal to Congress.
The budget included $750 billion for defense and $563 billion for non-defense spending.
The defense budget proposal included $576 billion for national defense and $165 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations fund.

On July 22, 2019, the White House and Congress reached a tentative two-year budget deal to raise spending caps and suspend the debt ceiling until July 2021.
Allocations for national defense spending increased to $738 billion in GFY 2020 and to $741 billion in GFY 2021.
For non-defense programs, spending increased to $632 billion in GFY 2020 and $635 billion in GFY 2021.
Overall, the measure increased spending by $323 billion over the limits set under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.
Congress is currently addressing the passage of appropriations bills for GFY 2020.
A CR was enacted on September 27, 2019, providing funding at GFY 2019 enacted levels until November 21, 2019.



International Markets



Sales to customers in international markets represented approximately 8% of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019.
The foreign currency impact was mainly attributable to adverse exchange rate movements in the British pound and Australian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________



(1) The non-GAAP measure of constant currency revenues is used to assess the performance of revenue activity without the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
We calculate revenues on a constant currency basis by translating current period revenue using the foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year periods.
This calculation is performed for all subsidiaries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

Non-operating expense, net for the nine months ended September 27, 2019 was $12 million as compared to $101 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2018.

For the three months ended September 27, 2019, our effective tax rate was 24.3% compared to 13.5% for the three months ended September 28, 2018.
The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits in the current quarter and a release of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward in the prior year quarter.
For the nine months ended September 27, 2019, our effective tax rate was 23.5% compared to 14.3% for the nine months ended September 28, 2018.
