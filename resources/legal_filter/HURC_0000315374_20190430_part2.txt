PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 



 Item 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 



From time to time, we are involved in claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business.
Pursuant to applicable accounting rules, we accrue the minimum liability for each known claim when the estimated outcome is a range of possible loss and no one amount within that range is more likely than another.
We maintain insurance policies for such matters, and we record insurance recoveries when we determine such recovery to be probable.

We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
