Item 2.
Encore believes it is a low-cost manufacturer of electrical building wire and cable.
The Company is a significant supplier of building wire for interior electrical wiring in commercial and industrial buildings, homes, apartments, and manufactured housing.
Price competition for electrical wire and cable is intense, and the Company sells its products in accordance with prevailing market prices.
Copper, a commodity product, is the principal raw material used by the Company in manufacturing its products.
Copper accounted for approximately 69.7%, 65.2%, and 72.1% of the Company’s cost of goods sold during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Additionally, the SEC allows shares of certain physically backed copper exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) to be listed and publicly traded.
Such funds and other copper ETFs like them hold copper cathode as collateral against their shares.
The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.
Wire prices can, and frequently do, change on a daily basis.
Historically, the Company has not engaged in hedging strategies for raw material purchases.
The tables below highlight the range of closing prices of copper on a per pound basis on the Comex exchange for the periods shown.
Reference should also be made to the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Results of Operations



Quarter Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Quarter Ended June 30, 2017 



Net sales were $336.8 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $291.5 million in the second quarter of 2017.
This 15.5% increase in net sales dollars is primarily the result of a 17.4% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 17.2% increase in the average selling price of copper wire and a 0.1% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped.
Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased increased 18.7% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 and was the principal driver of the increased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $292.3 million, or 86.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018, compared to $255.7 million, or 87.7% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2017.
Gross profit increased to $44.5 million, or 13.2% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018 versus $35.9 million, or 12.3% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2017.
The increase in gross profit margin percentage was driven principally by the increase of the copper wire spread.
The spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sales price for a pound of copper contained in finished wire increased 14.2% in the second quarter of 2018 versus the second quarter of 2017.
The spread increased as a result of the average sales price per pound of copper sold increasing 17.2% while the per pound cost of raw copper increased 18.7%.
The percentage change on sales is on a higher nominal dollar amount than on purchases and, therefore, spreads change on a nominal dollar basis.
The margin changes were due primarily to the competitive pricing environment in the industry.
We will continue to monitor conditions regarding aluminum wire and will take action to enforce our rights under the U.S. trade remedy laws if we determine that further action is warranted.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, increased to 76.4% of net sales in the second quarter of 2018, from 75.7% of net sales in the second quarter of 2017.
Lower overhead costs as a percentage of net sales somewhat offset this increase in total raw materials cost as a percentage of net sales.
Overheads contained some fixed and semi-fixed components which do not fluctuate as much as sales dollars fluctuate.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first out (LIFO) method, or market.
The Company maintains two inventory pools for LIFO purposes.
As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis and makes a monthly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO.
The Company performs a lower of cost or market calculation quarterly.
As of June 30, 2018, no LCM adjustment was required.
However, decreases in copper and other material prices could necessitate establishing an LCM reserve in future periods.
During the second quarter of 2017, a LIFO adjustment was recorded, decreasing cost of sales by $0.4 million.
Selling expenses, consisting of commissions and freight, for the second quarter of 2018 were $17.3 million, or 5.1% of net sales, compared to $14.1 million, or 4.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2017.
Freight costs as a percentage of net sales increased $2.2 million to $9.0 million or 2.7% of net sales in the second quarter of 2018 from 2.3% of net sales in the second quarter of 2017, primarily due to significant increases in freight rates.
Freight rates are up nationally as the highly publicized shortage of drivers and new regulations on the trucking industry impact rates in that industry.
General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses for the second quarter of 2018 were $4.2 million, or 1.2% of net sales, compared to $5.2 million, or 1.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2017.
The G&A decrease was driven primarily by reduced stock compensation expenses.
The Company did not record any bad debt expense during the second quarters of 2018 or 2017.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 



Net sales for the first six months of 2018 were $628.2 million compared to net sales of $570.9 million for the first six months of 2017.
This 10.0% increase in net sales is primarily the result of a 12.0% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 16.4% increase in the average selling price of copper wire, partially offset by a 3.8% decrease in copper wire unit volume shipped.
Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased increased 18.5% in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 and was the principal driver of the increased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold increased to $546.2 million in the first six months of 2018, compared to $495.8 million in the first six months of 2017.
Gross profit increased to $82.0 million, or 13.1% of net sales, in the first six months of 2018 versus $75.1 million, or 13.2% of net sales, in the first six months of 2017.
The gross profit margin percentage held steady despite the 3.8% unit volume decrease primarily as a result of an increase in the spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sale price for a pound of copper in the first six months of 2018 versus the first six months of 2017 due primarily to competitive industry pricing.
The copper spread increased 12.1% in the first six months of 2018 versus the first six months of 2017.
The spread increased as a result of the 16.4% increase in the average sales price per copper pound sold while the per pound cost of raw copper increased 18.5%.
In nominal dollars, the sales price increased more than the cost of copper.
During the same period in 2017, LIFO adjustments were recorded, increasing cost of sales by $4.0 million.
During the first six months of both 2018 and 2017, the Company liquidated a portion of the LIFO inventory layer in the aluminum wire pool established in prior years.
The liquidation had an insignificant effect on the net income of the Company.
Based on current copper prices, there is no LCM adjustment necessary.
Future reductions in the price of copper could require the Company to record an LCM adjustment against the related inventory balance, which would result in a negative impact on net income.
Selling expenses for the first six months of 2018 increased to $32.9 million, or 5.2% of net sales, compared to $27.6 million, or 4.8% of net sales, in the same period of 2017.
Freight costs for the first six months of 2018 increased to 2.8% of net sales, versus 2.3% of net sales for the first six months of 2017.
As discussed above, freight rates are up nationally as the highly publicized shortage of drivers and new regulations on the trucking industry impact rates in that industry.
General and administrative expenses were $11.5 million, or 1.8% of net sales, in the first half of 2018 compared to $10.5 million, or 1.8% of net sales, in the first half of 2017.
The Company did not record any bad debt expense during the first six months of 2018 and 2017.

Liquidity and Capital Resources



The Company maintains a substantial inventory of finished products to satisfy customers’ delivery requirements promptly.
As is customary in the building wire industry, the Company provides payment terms to most of its customers that exceed terms that it receives from its suppliers.
Copper suppliers generally give very short payment terms (less than 15 days) while the Company and the building wire industry give customers much longer terms.
In general, the Company’s standard payment terms result in the collection of a significant majority of net sales within approximately 75 days of the date of invoice.
As a result of this timing difference, building wire companies must have sufficient cash and access to capital resources to finance their working capital needs, thereby creating a barrier to entry for companies who do not have sufficient liquidity and capital resources.
The two largest components of working capital, receivables and inventory, and to a lesser extent, capital expenditures, are the primary drivers of the Company’s liquidity needs.
Capital expenditures have historically been necessary to expand and update the production capacity of the Company’s manufacturing operations.
The Company has historically satisfied its liquidity and capital expenditure needs with cash generated from operations and borrowings under its various debt arrangements.
The Company historically uses its revolving credit facility to manage day to day operating cash needs as required by daily fluctuations in working capital and has the facility in place should such a need arise in the future.
For more information on the Company’s revolving credit facility, see Note 6 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 to this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Cash used in operating activities was $6.0 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to $0.7 million of cash provided in the first six months of 2017.
The following changes in components of cash flow from operations were notable.
The Company had net income of $29.4 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to net income of $24.6 million in the first six months of 2017.
Accounts receivable increased $29.5 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to increasing $35.7 million in the first six months of 2017, resulting in a positive change in cash flow of $6.2 million in the first six months of 2018 versus the first six months of 2017.
Inventory value increased in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, using cash of $4.5 million and $2.2 million in the first six months of 2018 and 2017.
Trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities used cash of $9.6 million in 2018 versus a $14.5 million source of cash in 2017, resulting in a negative change in cash flow of $24.1 million.
In the first six months of 2018, changes in current and deferred taxes used cash of $1.3 million versus $7.6 million in the first six months of 2017.
These changes in cash flow were the primary drivers of the $6.7 million increase in cash used in operations in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017.
Cash used in investing activities increased to $14.8 million in the first six months of 2018 from $10.2 million in the first six months of 2017 due to higher capital expenditures on plant and equipment.
Cash used in financing activities in the first six months of 2018 consisted of $0.8 million of cash dividends paid, partially offset by $0.3 million of proceeds from exercised stock options.
These changes in cash flow were the primary drivers of the $0.5 million of cash used in financing activities for the first six months of 2018 versus $0.4 million used in the first six months of 2017.
As of June 30, 2018, the balance on the Company’s revolving line of credit remained at zero.
The Company’s cash balance was $102.0 million at June 30, 2018 versus $85.9 million at June 30, 2017.
The total capital expenditures for all of 2018 associated with these projects are currently estimated to be between $34 million and $39 million.
The Company believes that the current cash balance, cash flow from operations, and the financing available from its revolving credit facility will satisfy anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements during 2018.
