Overview



MTS Systems Corporation is a leading global supplier of high performance test systems and sensors.
Our testing hardware and software solutions help customers accelerate and improve design, development and manufacturing processes and are used for determining the mechanical behavior of materials, products and structures.
Our high performance sensors provide controls for a variety of applications measuring acceleration, position, vibration, motion, pressure, force and sound.
As of September 30, 2017, we had 3,500 employees and revenue of $787,955 for fiscal year 2017.
Our desire is to be the innovation leader in creating test and measurement solutions and to provide total customer satisfaction.
We believe we can create value for our customers by helping to enhance the precision, improve the reliability and create superior safety for their products, while reducing the delivery time to market for their products.
Our competitive advantages include our proprietary technology and advanced application expertise, our expansive global footprint with long-term customer relationships, our large installed base of testing equipment and our expanded presence in the rapidly growing sensors market.
We are working toward our goals of sustained five to seven percent growth in annual revenue; three to four points of expanded earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); and mid-teens for return on invested capital (ROIC).
We believe the growth in our end markets, combined with four primary opportunities we are currently pursuing, will support these goals: 



•Realize growth within the rapidly expanding Sensors market through an increase in our global market share and new product development;



•Expand Test services offerings into our large installed base of Test equipment;



•Capitalize on growth opportunities in the Test materials sector spurred by new manufacturing processes, focus on light-weight materials in aerospace and ground vehicle markets, and trends in energy exploration; and 



•Adapt our industry-leading ground vehicle testing applications to align with emerging trends in vehicle electrification, autonomous vehicles, and simulation.
We believe that our business model supports our growth objectives, provided that we continue to move aggressively to build our infrastructure, expand our offerings and execute on opportunities with our key customers around the world.
In order to accelerate our revenue growth over the next five years, investments in infrastructure, sales support and field service capacity and capability are essential.
See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the impact of the Tax Act.
Foreign Currency



Approximately 70% of our revenue has historically been derived from customers outside of the U.S. Our financial results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan.
The discussion below quantifies the impact of foreign currency translation on our financial results for the periods discussed.
Terms



The terms "MTS," "we," "us," the "Company," or "our" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, refer to MTS Systems Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

Results of Operations



The following table compares results of operations, separately identifying the estimated impact of currency translation and restructuring costs incurred in fiscal year 2018.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on restructuring and related costs.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we completed the acquisition of PCB Group, Inc. (PCB).
As a result of the PCB acquisition, we incurred certain non-recurring costs during fiscal year 2017 including acquisition integration costs and a fair value adjustment on acquired PCB inventory.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Revenue for the three months ended December 30, 2017 declined by 2.6% primarily due to a decrease in Test revenue, partially offset by revenue growth in our Sensors business and the favorable impact of currency translation.
Test revenue decreased $12,923 primarily driven by lower equipment order volume in the first half of fiscal year 2017.
Current year Test revenue was also impacted by higher custom project backlog weighting which takes longer to convert into revenue.
Sensors revenue increased $7,806 primarily driven by strong demand in the Sensors position sector and continued momentum from new revenue opportunities in the Sensors test sector.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, revenue decreased 4.6%.
26

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Gross profit for the three months ended December 30, 2017 increased 6.1% primarily due to the prior year impact from the PCB acquisition driven by a fair value adjustment on acquired inventory of $7,724 and increased current year revenue volume in Sensors, partially offset by reduced revenue volume in Test.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, the prior year fair value adjustment on acquired PCB inventory, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, gross profit declined 5.9% and the gross margin rate declined 0.6 percentage points.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Selling and marketing expense for the three months ended December 30, 2017 increased by 5.1% primarily due to higher compensation expenses in Sensors and the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



General and administrative expense for the three months ended December 30, 2017 declined by 14.4% primarily due to prior year non-recurring China Code of Conduct investigation expenses of $1,976, prior year PCB acquisition integration expenses of $1,503, and decreased professional fees, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency translation.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Research and development (R&D) expense for the three months ended December 30, 2017 increased by 1.8%, primarily due to continued investments in Sensors product development, partially offset by prior year focused R&D spending to meet certain Test market needs.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, R&D expense increased 1.1%.
27

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Income from operations for the three months ended December 30, 2017 increased by 60.3% primarily due to the prior year impact from the PCB acquisition driven by a fair value adjustment on acquired PCB inventory of $7,724 and non-recurring PCB acquisition integration expenses of $1,688, prior year China investigation expenses of $1,976, increased gross profit from leverage on volume growth in Sensors, and prior year restructuring costs of $563, partially offset by decreased Test gross profit from unfavorable leverage on revenue.
Excluding the impact of currency translation, the prior year fair value adjustment on acquired PCB inventory, prior year non-recurring PCB acquisition integration expenses, prior year China investigation expenses, and restructuring costs incurred in both fiscal years, income from operations decreased 25.5%.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Interest expense, net for the three months ended December 30, 2017 decreased primarily due to reduced interest rates on the tranche B term loan facility as a result of the debt repricing completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, as well as lower current year average debt outstanding.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in other income (expense), net for the three months ended December 30, 2017 was primarily driven by a decrease in losses on foreign currency transactions.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 30, 2017 decreased due to certain discrete benefits of $25,378 for the estimated impact of the Tax Act.
The discrete benefits primarily related to $32,264 of estimated benefit from the remeasurement of our estimated net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by $6,886 of estimated expense associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation tax.
Excluding the impact of these discrete benefits, the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 30, 2017 would have been 17.9% and decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate under the Tax Act.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Net income and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 30, 2017 increased due to a reduction in the effective tax rate and discrete benefits stemming from the Tax Act, as well as increased gross profit and lower operating expenses.

Cash Flow Comparison



The following table summarizes our cash flows from total operations:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Operating Activities



The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in working capital associated with fluctuations in the timing of cash receipts for advanced payments from customers, payments received on accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable, payments for inventory and reduced payments for accounts payable.
Investing Activities



The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the timing of investments in property and equipment in the current year.
Financing Activities



The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the annual required excess cash flow payment on the tranche B term loan made in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, partially offset by borrowing on our revolving credit facility.

Liquidity and Capital Resources



We had cash and cash equivalents of $94,071 as of December 30, 2017.
Of this amount, $12,947 was located in North America, $30,442 in Europe and $50,682 in Asia.
The North American balance was primarily invested in bank deposits.
The balances in Europe and Asia were primarily invested in money market funds and bank deposits.
In accordance with our investment policy, we place cash equivalent investments with issuers who have high-quality investment credit ratings.
Our investment objectives are to preserve principal, maintain liquidity and achieve the best available return consistent with our primary objectives of safety and liquidity.
As of December 30, 2017, we held no short-term investments.
As of December 30, 2017, our capital structure was comprised of $64,098 in short-term debt, $393,381 in long-term debt and $461,580 in shareholders' equity.
The Consolidated Balance Sheets also include $15,432 of unamortized debt issuance costs as of December 30, 2017.
Total interest-bearing debt at December 30, 2017 was $457,479.
On July 5, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with a consortium of financial institutions (the Credit Agreement).
The Credit Agreement provides for senior secured credit facilities consisting of a Revolving Credit Facility and a Term Facility.
The maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility is July 5, 2021 and the maturity date of the loans under the Term Facility is July 5, 2023, unless a term loan lender agrees to extend the maturity date pursuant to a loan modification agreement made in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement also requires mandatory prepayments on our Term Facility in certain circumstances, including a required prepayment of a certain percentage of our excess cash flow for each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 2017.
Under the Credit Agreement, we are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among others, restrictions on our ability to incur debt, create liens, dispose of assets, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, and enter into any restrictive agreements and customary events of default (including payment defaults, covenant defaults, change of control defaults and bankruptcy defaults).
The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants, including the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to adjusted consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), as defined in the Credit Agreement, as well as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense.
These covenants restrict our ability to pay dividends and purchase outstanding shares of common stock.
As of December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.
Shareholders' equity increased by $32,803 during the three months ended December 30, 2017 primarily due to $33,151 net income, $4,006 other comprehensive income and $1,515 stock-based compensation, partially offset by $5,337 dividends declared and $744 purchases and retirements of our common stock.

Other Matters



Dividends



Our dividend policy is to maintain a payout ratio that allows dividends to increase in conjunction with the long-term growth of earnings per share, while sustaining dividends through economic cycles.
Our dividend practice is to target, over time, a payout ratio of approximately 25% of net earnings per share.
The declaration and payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our earnings, financial condition, debt repayment obligations, business developments needs and regulatory consideration and are at the discretion of our Board of Directors.
Forward-looking statements are qualified by some or all of these risk factors.
