Overview 
Espey began operations after incorporation in New York in 1928. We strive to remain competitive as a leader in high power energy conversion and transformer solutions through the design and manufacture of new and improved products by using advanced and “cutting edge” electronics technologies. 
There is competition in all classes of products manufactured by the Company, ranging from divisions of the largest electronic companies, to many small companies. The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products. The principal methods of competition for electronic products of both a military and industrial nature include, among other factors, price, product performance, the experience of the particular company and history of its dealings in such products. 
In order to maintain a balanced business, we are continuing to place an emphasis on securing “build to print” opportunities, which will allow production work to go directly to the manufacturing floor, limiting the impact on our engineering staff. This effort will keep our manufacturing team busy while the products being developed transition to production. 
New orders received in the first six months of fiscal year 2019 were approximately $13.4 million as compared to $14.3 million of new orders received in the first six months of fiscal 2018. It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $24.4 million of orders comprising the December 31, 2018 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. The minimum of $24.4 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. The estimate of the December 31, 2018 backlog to be shipped in fiscal year 2019 is subject to future events, which may cause the amount of the backlog actually shipped to differ from such estimate. 
A significant portion of the Company’s business is the production of military and industrial electronic equipment for use by the U.S. and foreign governments and certain industrial customers. Net sales to two significant customers represented 49.4% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2018 and net sales to three significant customers represented 63.2% of the Company's total sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017. Net sales to two significant customers represented 54.4% and 61.0% of the Company’s total sales for the six-month period ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This high concentration level with these customers presents significant risk. A loss of one of these customers or programs related to these customers could significantly impact the Company. Historically, a small number of customers have accounted for a large percentage of the Company’s total sales in any given fiscal year. 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
Revenue 
We account for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of consideration is probable. We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time, or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. 
We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligation. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations. We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract. The transaction price for each performance obligation is based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. Transaction prices on our contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) are typically based on estimated costs plus a reasonable profit margin. 
We recognize revenue using the output method based on the appraisal of results achieved and milestones reached or units delivered based on contractual shipment terms, typically shipping point. 
Inventory 
Inventoried work relating to contracts in process and work in process is valued at actual production cost, including factory overhead incurred to date. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor, and an allocation of overhead costs. Work in process represents spare units and parts and other inventory items acquired or produced to service units previously sold or to meet anticipated future orders. Provision for losses on contracts is made when the existence of such losses becomes probable and estimable. The provision for losses on contracts is included in other accrued expenses on the Company’s balance sheet. The costs attributed to units delivered under contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced. Certain contracts are expected to extend beyond twelve months. 
Contract Liabilities 
Net sales decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2018 to $7,303,109 as compared to $11,531,105 for the same period in 2017. Net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2018 decreased to $15,640,508 as compared to $19,027,528 for the same period in 2017. For the three months ended December 31, 2018, the decline in net sales is primarily due to a decrease in power supply shipments on a specific military contract and a decrease in shipments supporting the rail industry. For the six months ended December 31, 2018, the decrease in net sales is primarily due to the timing of power supply shipments related to a specific military contract which had significant shipments in the prior fiscal year, offset in part by an increase in build to print sales. This decline in both periods is largely due to timing of shipments based on customer contractual delivery dates and shipments that have not been made due to engineering design changes required to meet customer requirements, certain supplier product non-conformances and an increase in lead times for certain electronic components due to industry shortages and volatility within the power electronics industry. We are currently working closely with our customers and suppliers to execute on our current past due deliveries and we do not expect this situation to impact future business. 
Gross profits for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $1,516,235 and $3,075,598, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20.8% and 26.7%, for the same periods, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, gross profits were $2,509,169 and $4,536,752, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 16.0% and 23.8%, for the same periods, respectively. The primary factors in determining the change in gross profit and net income are overall sales levels and product mix. The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production. In the case of the latter, the Company can incur what it refers to as “loss contracts,” meaning engineering design contracts in which the Company invests with the objective of developing future product sales. In any given accounting period the mix of product shipments between higher margin programs and less mature programs, and expenditures associated with loss contracts, has a significant impact on gross profit and net income. The gross profit percentage decreased in the three and six months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to the impact of incurred spending related to a specific engineering design contract. This increase in spending reduced the gross profit percentage by 7.2% and 8.0% for the three and six month periods, respectively. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,295,687 for the three months ended December 31, 2018; an increase of $313,317, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2,305,231 for the six months ended December 31, 2018; an increase of $444,041 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2017. The increase for the three months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 relates primarily to the increase in employee compensation costs associated with added program management personnel supporting the Company’s sales backlog, professional services, and other miscellaneous expenses. The increase for the six months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 relates primarily to the increases described for the three month period, however, for the six-month period ended December 31, 2018, the increases were offset, in part, by a reduction in travel, and incurred marketing costs. 
Other income for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $53,361 and $43,289, respectively. Other income for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $129,432 and $84,685, respectively. The increase for the three and six months is primarily due an increase in interest income resulting from the gradual increase in current yield percentages earned on investment securities. Interest income is a function of the level of investments and investment strategies which generally tend to be conservative.  
The Company’s effective tax rates for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, were 20.5% and 16.2%, respectively, compared to 24.4% and 25.5% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017. The statutory tax rate was reduced from 34% to 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act’) effective on January 1, 2018. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 is less than the statutory tax rate mainly due to the benefit derived from the ESOP dividends paid on allocated shares and for the tax benefit received in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from the exercise of stock options. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 is less than the statutory tax rate mainly due to the benefit the Company received on its “qualified production activities” under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 which expired after the end of fiscal 2018 and the benefit derived from the ESOP dividends paid on allocated shares. 
Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2018, was $217,758 or $0.09 per share both basic and diluted, respectively compared to $1,614,871 or $0.69 per share both basic and diluted, for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Net income for the six months ended December 31, 2018, was $279,430 or $0.12 per share both basic and diluted compared to $2,057,635 or $0.88 per share both basic and diluted for the six months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net income per share for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018 was due to lower sales, lower gross profit and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses when compared to the same periods in 2017 as discussed above. These decreases were mitigated, in part, by an increase in investment income and a reduction in income taxes resulting primarily from the decrease in the Company’s effective tax rate resulting from the decrease in the statutory tax rate effective January 1, 2018. 
The Company's working capital is an appropriate indicator of the liquidity of its business, and during the past two fiscal years, the Company, when possible, has funded all of its operations with cash flows resulting from operating activities and when necessary from its existing cash and investments. The Company did not borrow any funds during the last two fiscal years. Management has available a $3,000,000 line of credit to help fund further growth or working capital needs, if necessary, but does not anticipate the need for any borrowed funds in the foreseeable future. Contingent liabilities on outstanding standby letters of credit agreements aggregated to zero at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The line of credit is reviewed annually in November for renewal by December 1st. 
The Company's working capital as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $26.7 million and $30.4 million, respectively. During the three and six-month period ended December 31, 2018, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock from the Company’s Employee Retirement Plan and Trust (“ESOP”). During the three and six-months ended December 31, 2017 the Company repurchased 4,798 shares of its common stock from the ESOP for a purchase price of $109,694. Under existing authorizations from the Company's Board of Directors, as of December 31, 2018, management is authorized to purchase an additional $876,297 of Company stock. 
Net cash used in operating activities fluctuates between periods primarily as a result of differences in sales and net income, provision for income taxes, the timing of the collection of accounts receivable, purchase of inventory, and payment of accounts payable. The increase in cash used in operating activities compared to the prior year primarily relates to a decrease in net income and income tax payable and the increase in inventories attributed to the sales volume and backlog increases offset, in part, by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, the collection of trade receivables and the increase in accounts payable. Net cash provided by investing activities increased in the six months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 is primarily due to an increase in maturing investments offset, in part, by an increase in spending for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The increase in cash used in financing activities in the current period is primarily related to the cash expended for the special dividend totaling $1.00 per share declared and paid in fiscal 2019 offset, in part, by proceeds received from the exercise of stock options during the current fiscal year. 
The Company currently believes that the cash flow generated from operations and when necessary, from cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its long-term funding requirements for the foreseeable future. 
During the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company expended $354,933 and $185,190, respectively, for plant improvements and new equipment. The Company has budgeted approximately $750,000 for new equipment and plant improvements in fiscal year 2019. Management anticipates that the funds required will be available from current operations. 
Management believes that the Company's reserve for bad debts of $3,000 is adequate given the customers with whom the Company does business. Historically, bad debt expense has been minimal. 
 Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 (1)Pursuant to a prior Board of Directors authorization, as of December 31, 2018 the Company can repurchase up to $876,297 of its common stock pursuant to an ongoing plan.
