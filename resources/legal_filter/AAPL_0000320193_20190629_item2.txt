The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method.
Based on the Company’s derivative portfolio and hedging strategies, the adoption of ASU 2017-12 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
