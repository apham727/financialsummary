Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”).
Executive Summary
For the first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized net sales of $405.5 million compared to $417.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 representing a decrease of $12.3 million, or 2.9%. The decrease was primarily driven by $9.9 million or 2.4% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and decreased volume in the passenger car and automotive sensors businesses within the Automotive segment, partially offset by higher volumes in the semiconductor business in the Electronics segment as result of the IXYS acquisition completed on January 17, 2018. The Company recognized net income of $37.0 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to net income of $36.0 million, or $1.45 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in net income reflects lower non-segment charges compared to prior year primarily due to the IXYS acquisition, partially offset by lower operating income across all segments and foreign exchange losses. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $30.9 million for the three months ended March 30, 2019 as compared to $69.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflected lower earnings and higher working capital levels primarily due to the timing of supplier and customer payments.
During the three months ended March 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 79,916 shares of its common stock totaling $13.6 million. Since September 30, 2018, the Company has repurchased 471,888 shares of its common stock at an average price of $172.62 totaling $81.5 million.
Net Sales
Net sales decreased $12.3 million or 2.9% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to $9.9 million or 2.4% of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, lower volume in the automotive sensors and passenger car businesses within the Automotive segment, partially offset by higher sales in the semiconductor business driven by the IXYS acquisition.

Operating Expenses
Operating Income
Operating income was $60.7 million, an increase of $23.1 million, or 61.5%, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $37.6 million for the first quarter of 2018. The increase in operating income is due to the $17.9 million purchase accounting inventory step-up charges and the lower operating expenses noted above partially offset by lower operating income across all segments. Operating margins increased from 9.0% in the first quarter of 2018 to 15.0% in the first quarter of 2019 driven by factors mentioned above.
Income before income taxes was $46.4 million, or 11.5% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $44.6 million, or 10.7% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before taxes was impacted by foreign exchange losses of $4.2 million during the three months ended March 30, 2019 compared to foreign exchange gains of $10.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018, impairment charges of $2.8 million for certain other investments and a $2.6 million loss on the disposal of a business within the Electronics segment.
Segment Results of Operations
Electronics Segment
Net sales increased $1.0 million, or 0.4%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to $10.2 million increase in the semiconductor business due to the IXYS acquisition completed on January 17, 2018, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impact of $5.3 million and lower electronics products volume.
Automotive Segment
Industrial Segment
Net sales decreased slightly by $0.6 million, or 2.4%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to the exit of the Custom business during the second quarter of 2018 and unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $0.2 million, partially offset by higher volume across the power fuse and relay businesses.
