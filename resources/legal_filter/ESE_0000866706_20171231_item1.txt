BASIS OF PRESENTATION  



The accompanying consolidated financial statements, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented.
The Company’s results for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire 2018 fiscal year.
References to the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 represent the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)  



Basic EPS is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of dilutive common share options and vesting of performance-accelerated restricted shares (restricted shares) by using the treasury stock method.
There are no anti-dilutive shares.
The number of shares used in the calculation of earnings per share for each period presented is as follows (in thousands):

EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and taxes.
EBIT on a consolidated basis is a non-GAAP financial measure.
EBIT is also one of the measures used by management in determining resource allocations within the Company as well as incentive compensation.
The Company believes that the presentation of EBIT provides important supplemental information to investors to facilitate comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.
Furthermore, the use of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to replace any measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP.
7.
DEBT  



The Company’s debt is summarized as follows: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The Company’s existing credit facility (“the Credit Facility”) matures December 21, 2020.
The Credit Facility includes a $450 million revolving line of credit as well as provisions allowing for the increase of the facility commitment amount by an additional $250 million, if necessary, with the consent of the lenders.
The bank syndication supporting the facility is comprised of a diverse group of nine banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent.
At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $181 million available to borrow under the Credit Facility, and a $250 million increase option, in addition to $41.6 million cash on hand.
At December 31, 2017, the Company had $260 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility in addition to outstanding letters of credit of $9.0 million.
The Company classified $20.0 million as the current portion of long-term debt as of December 31, 2017, as the Company intends to repay this amount within the next twelve month period; however, the Company has no contractual obligation to repay such amount during the next twelve month period.
The Credit Facility requires, as determined by certain financial ratios, a facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 27.5 basis points per year on the unused portion.
The terms of the facility provide that interest on borrowings may be calculated at a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or based on the prime rate, at the Company’s election.
The facility is secured by the unlimited guaranty of the Company’s material domestic subsidiaries and a 65% pledge of the material foreign subsidiaries’ share equity.
The financial covenants of the Credit Facility include a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio.
The weighted average interest rates were 2.74% and 1.61% for the three-month periods ending December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
At December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.
8.
The first quarter 2018 effective income tax rate was (170.8%) compared to 33.5% in the first quarter of 2017.
H.R.
The total impact of the TCJA in the first quarter of 2018 was a net benefit of $25.1 million.
The impacts were as follows: First, the Company’s 2018 federal statutory rate dropped from 35.0% to 24.5% which requires an adjustment to the value of its deferred tax assets and liabilities since the first quarter of 2018 is the period that includes the enactment date.
This adjustment ($30.3 million provisional amount) favorably impacted the first quarter effective tax rate by 236.8%.
The Company also recorded a $2.3 million provisional estimate of the income tax effects of the future repatriation of the cumulative earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which unfavorably impacted the first quarter effective tax rate by 18.3%.
9 



Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (SAB 118) was issued by the SEC effective December 22, 2017.
SAB 118 permits registrants to record adjustments to its provisional amounts during the measurement period (which cannot exceed one year).
The Company is evaluating these considerations to determine the amount of its foreign subsidiaries’ cumulative earnings it intends to indefinitely reinvest.
The TCJA includes a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”).
Because there are interpretative questions associated with the approach that involves recognizing deferred taxes, the Company will undertake an evaluation of these questions and make the accounting policy election during the SAB 118 measurement period.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 11.
During 2016, the Company entered into several forward contracts to purchase pounds sterling (GBP) to hedge two deferred payments due in connection with the acquisition of Plastique.
During the first quarter of 2018, the Company entered into three interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $150 million to hedge some of its exposure to variability in future LIBOR-based interest payments on variable rate debt.
All derivative instruments are reported in either accrued expenses or other receivables on the balance sheet at fair value.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until recognized in earnings with the underlying hedged item.
The interest rate swaps entered into during the first quarter of 2018 were not designated as cash flow hedges and, therefore, the gain or loss on the derivative is reflected in earnings each period.
**This swap represents a forward contract and will be effective in November 2019.

· Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
· Level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, inventories, payables, debt and other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 



The Company’s forward contracts are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 825, as presented below as of December 31, 2017: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Valuation was based on third party evidence of similarly priced derivative instruments.
Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities 



The Company’s nonfinancial assets such as property, plant and equipment, and other intangible assets are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis; however they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence that an impairment may exist.
No impairments were recorded during the three-month period ended December 31, 2017.
13.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  



In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which updates ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits.
These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted on a retrospective basis.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedge Activities, which updates ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
The updates eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements.
These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-062, Leases (Topic 842), which, among other things, requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.
This standard will increase an entities’ reported assets and liabilities.
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and mandates a modified retrospective transition period for all entities.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
This guidance has been further clarified and amended.
The new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.
The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
The Company has selected the Cumulative Effect method of transition to the new standard.
