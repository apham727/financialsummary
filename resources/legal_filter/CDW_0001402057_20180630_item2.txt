Overview



CDW Corporation ("Parent") is a Fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated information technology ("IT") solutions to small, medium and large business, and government, education and healthcare customers in the United States ("US"), the United Kingdom ("UK") and Canada.
Our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration.
We are technology "agnostic," with a portfolio including more than 100,000 products and services from more than 1,000 leading and emerging brands.
Our solutions are delivered in physical, virtual and cloud-based environments through over 6,000 customer-facing coworkers, including sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers.
We are a leading sales channel partner for many original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), software publishers and cloud providers (collectively, our "vendor partners"), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer.
We provide our vendor partners with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage, technical expertise and extensive customer access.
Our Corporate segment primarily serves US private sector business customers with more than 250 employees.
Our Small Business segment primarily serves US private sector business customers with up to 250 employees.
Our Public segment is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the US.
We also have two other operating segments: CDW UK and CDW Canada, each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category ("Other").
We may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer.
Each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements.
We also resell software for major software publishers.
Our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services.
In addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals.
A significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses are reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners.
Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended ("Topic 606"), utilizing the full retrospective method as discussed in Note 2 (Recent Accounting Pronouncements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Prior period amounts have been adjusted accordingly.
This is particularly the case for business customers, as their purchases tend to reflect confidence in their business prospects, which are driven by their perceptions of business conditions.
•Changes in spending policies, budget priorities and funding levels are a key factor influencing the purchasing levels of government, healthcare and education customers.
37

•Technology trends drive customer purchasing behaviors in the market.
These trends are driving customer adoption of solutions such as those delivered via cloud, software defined architectures and hybrid on-premise and off-premise combinations.
We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per common share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, return on working capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable plus days of supply in Inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios, sales per coworker and coworker turnover.
These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.
In this Form 10-Q, we discuss Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business.
Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure in the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility ("Term Loan"), which is used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments.
For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 6 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
For the definitions of Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliations to Net income, see "Results of Operations."
The results of certain business metrics are as follows:

Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, constant currency Net sales growth was 7.0%.
See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations" below for additional information regarding constant currency Net sales growth.
For the three months ended June 30, 2018, ongoing focus on client device refresh across all customer-end markets, except Federal, coupled with strong results from our international operations, drove Net sales growth.
Corporate segment Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $154 million, or 9.7%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Growth was primarily driven by client device refresh, as well as ongoing success helping customers with solutions, including data center and software.

The growth was primarily driven by Healthcare, which offset declines in sales to Government customers.
Net sales in Healthcare increased 6.3%, primarily driven by performance in desktops and video products as customers move forward on refresh projects.
This was partially offset by sales to State & Local government customers, which were primarily driven by client device refresh.
Education Net sales increased 1.0%.
Net sales in Other, which is comprised of results from our UK and Canadian operations, for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased $124 million, or 34.0%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017.
In addition, UK growth was driven in part by increased sales from referrals for US-based customers.
The impact of foreign currency exchange increased Other sales growth by approximately 700 basis points, due to the favorable impact resulting from the British pound and Canadian dollar to US dollar translations.

This was driven by higher sales payroll costs, including sales commissions primarily due to higher Gross profit dollars, partially offset by lower equity-based compensation expense and the associated payroll taxes due to the vesting in the prior year of an equity grant made at the time of our initial public offering.
Total coworker count was 8,917, up 130 from 8,787 at June 30, 2017.
Total coworker count was 8,726 at December 31, 2017.
As a percentage of total Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses decreased 20 basis points to 9.1% during the three months ended June 30, 2018, down from 9.3% in the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Income from operations



Income from operations by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of Net sales, and the year-over-year percentage change are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



* Not meaningful



(1)Amounts for 2017 have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of Topic 606.

Other operating margin percentage increased 110 basis points to 4.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from 3.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
Also contributing to the increased operating margin percentage is the non-recurrence of integration expenses in the current year.
Income tax expense



Income tax expense was $57 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $54 million for the same period of the prior year.
The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily attributable to the reduction in the US federal statutory rate, partially offset by lower excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation and a higher effective net state income tax rate primarily due to the reduced US federal benefit.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations



We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 below.
EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization.
Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net sales.
Consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as consolidated Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.
Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business.
Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure in the credit agreement governing our Term Loan used to evaluate our ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt, and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments.
For further details regarding the Term Loan, see Note 6 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Non-GAAP net income



Non-GAAP net income was $213 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, an increase of $50 million, or 30.8%, compared to $163 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
