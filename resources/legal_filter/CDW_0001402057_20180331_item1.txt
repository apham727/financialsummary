NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1.Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



Description of Business



CDW Corporation ("Parent") is a Fortune 500 company with multi-national capabilities and a leading provider of integrated information technology ("IT") solutions to small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers in the United States ("US"), the United Kingdom ("UK") and Canada.
The Company's offerings range from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration.
Throughout this report, the terms the "Company" and "CDW" refer to Parent and its 100% owned subsidiaries.
CDW Finance Corporation is a Delaware corporation formed for the sole purpose of acting as co-issuer of certain debt obligations as described in Note 12 (Supplemental Guarantor Information) and does not hold any material assets or engage in any business activities or operations.
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the requirements of Topic 606 utilizing the full retrospective method as discussed in Note 2 (Recent Accounting Pronouncements).
Prior period amounts have been adjusted accordingly.
Principles of Consolidation



The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Parent and its 100% owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation.
Except as noted above for the adoption of Topic 606, there have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The Company considers the following indicators amongst others when determining whether it is acting as a principal in the transaction and recording revenue on a gross basis: (i) the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or service, (ii) the Company has inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to a customer or after transfer of control to the customer and (iii) the Company has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service.
If a transaction does not meet the Company's indicators of being a principal in the transaction, then the Company is acting as an agent in the transaction and the associated revenues are recognized on a net basis.
The Company recognizes revenue once control has passed to the customer.
The following indicators are evaluated in determining when control has passed to the customer: (i) the Company has a right to payment for the product or service, (ii) the customer has legal title to the product, (iii) the Company has transferred physical possession of the product to the customer, (iv) the customer has the significant risk and rewards of ownership of the product and (v) the customer has accepted the product.
The Company's products can be delivered to customers in a variety of ways, including (i) as physical product shipped from the Company's warehouse, (ii) via drop-shipment by the vendor or supplier or (iii) via electronic delivery of keys for software licenses.
The Companyâ€™s shipping terms typically specify F.O.B.
destination.
The Company is the principal in the transaction and recognizes revenue for drop-shipment arrangements on a gross basis.
The Company recognizes revenue from these transactions when control has passed to the customer, which is usually upon delivery of the product to the customer.
For these transactions, the Company deems that control passes to the customer when the product is ready for delivery.
Revenue Recognition for Software



Revenues from most software license sales are recognized as a single performance obligation on a gross basis as the Company is acting as a principal in these transactions at the point the software license is delivered to the customer.
The Company evaluates whether the software assurance is a separate performance obligation by assessing if the third-party delivered software assurance is critical or essential to the core functionality of the software itself.
If the Company determines that the accompanying third-party delivered software assurance is critical or essential to the core functionality of the software license, the software license and the accompanying third-party delivered software assurance are recognized as a single performance obligation.
The value of the product is primarily the accompanying support delivered by a third-party and therefore the Company is acting as an agent in these transactions and recognizes them on a net basis at the point the associated software license is delivered to the customer.
For software licenses where the accompanying third-party delivered software assurance is not critical or essential to the core functionality, the software assurance is recognized as a separate performance obligation, with the associated revenue recognized on a net basis at the point the related software license is delivered to the customer.
For additional details regarding the accounting for bundled arrangements, see "Revenue Recognition for Bundled Arrangements" below.
The Company's vendor partners warrant most of the products the Company sells.
The warranties are not sold separately and only provide assurance that products will conform with the manufacturer's specifications.
These extended warranties are sold separately and provide the customer with a service in addition to assurance that the product will function as expected.
The Company considers these service-type warranties to be separate performance obligations from the underlying product.
For service-type warranties, the Company is arranging for those services to be provided by the third-party and therefore is acting as an agent in the transaction and records revenue on a net basis at the point of sale.
Revenue Recognition for Services



The Company provides professional services, which include project managers and consultants recommending, designing and implementing IT solutions.
The Company sells cloud computing solutions, which include Software as a Service ("SaaS") and Infrastructure as a Service ("IaaS").
SaaS solutions utilize third-party partners to offer the Company's customers access to software in the cloud that enhances office productivity, provides security or assists in collaboration.
IaaS solutions utilize third-party partners to enable customers to access data center functionality in a cloud-based solution, including storage, computing and networking.
The Company recognizes revenue for cloud computing solutions for arrangements with one-time invoicing to the customer at the time of invoice on a net basis as the Company is acting as an agent in the transaction.
For subscription-based arrangements with monthly billing, the Company is acting as an agent in the transaction and recognizes revenue as it invoices the customer for its monthly usage on a net basis.
Revenues from the sale of data center services, such as managed and remote managed services, server co-location, internet connectivity and data backup and storage provided by the Company, are recognized over the period the service is provided.
Most hosting and managed service obligations are based on the quantity and pricing parameters established in the agreement.
As the customer receives the benefit of service each month, the Company recognizes the respective revenue on a gross basis as the Company is acting as a principal in the transaction.
The Company is acting as the principal in the transaction and recognizes revenue on a gross basis based on the total number of hours incurred for the period over the total expected hours for the project.
Total expected hours to complete the project is updated for each period and best represents the transfer of control of the service to the customer.
The Company's customers are offered the opportunity by certain of its vendors to purchase software licenses and software assurance under enterprise agreements ("EAs"), referred to as services in this paragraph.
The Company's performance obligations are satisfied at the time of the sale.
This results in the Company acting as a principal in the agreement.
With most EAs, the Company's vendors will transfer the license and invoice the customer directly, paying resellers an agency fee or commission on these sales.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



Revenue Recognition for Bundled Arrangements



The Company also sells some of its products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables, which may include a combination of products and services.
The Company excludes amounts collected on behalf of third-parties, such as sales taxes, when determining the transaction price.
For certain performance obligations, the Company will use a combination of methods to estimate the standalone selling price.
When evidence from recent transactions is not available to confirm that the prices are representative of the standalone selling price, an expected cost plus a margin approach is used.
The Company estimates variable consideration at the most likely amount to which it is expected to be entitled.
When a contract results in revenue being recognized in excess of the amount the Company has the right to invoice to the customer, a contract asset is recorded on the balance sheet.
Contract assets are comprised primarily of professional services with fixed fee arrangements.
Contract liabilities consist of payments received from customers, or such consideration that is contractually due, in advance of providing the product or performing services.
Contract liabilities are comprised primarily of professional services with fixed fee arrangements, bill-and-hold transactions where control has not passed to the customer and certain governmental contracts.
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the point of sale (or in accordance with the Statement of Work for services) for the total amount payable by the customer to the Company for sale of goods.
Taxes to be collected from the customer as part of the sale are included in Accounts receivable trade.
Any incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the period of contract performance.
The Company typically does not enter into long-term contracts.
The Company has elected to use the practical expedient for its performance obligations table to show only those contracts that are longer than 12 months at the time of contract inception and those contracts that are non-cancelable.
Additionally, for certain governmental contracts where there are annual renewals, the Company has excluded these contracts since there is only a one-year legal obligation.
Typically, the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



only contracts that are longer than 12 months in duration are related to the Company's professional and managed services business.
The Company requests payments for its products and services at the point of sale.
The Company generally does not enter into any long-term financing arrangements or payment plans with customers or contracts with customers that have non-cash consideration.
2.
The ASU eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item.
The ASU also simplifies certain documentation and assessment requirements, and will incorporate new disclosure requirements and amendments to existing disclosures.
This ASU is effective for the Company beginning the first quarter of 2019 and allows for early adoption.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact the ASU will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments



In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
This ASU introduces a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables.
This ASU is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and allows for early adoption beginning in the first quarter of 2019.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact the ASU will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Accounting for Leases



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements.
This ASU is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and allows for early adoption.
Although the Company is currently evaluating the provisions of the ASU to determine how it will be affected, the primary impact to the Company of the new ASU will be to record assets and liabilities for current operating leases, which are principally related to the Company's real estate portfolio.
Revenue Recognition



On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 and utilized the full retrospective method.
For additional details, see Note 1 (Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).
3.Inventory Financing Agreements



The Company has entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions, as described below.
These amounts are classified separately as Accounts payable-inventory financing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company does not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due.

Amounts included in Accounts payable-inventory financing are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)The Senior Secured Asset-Based Revolving Credit Facility includes an inventory floorplan sub-facility that enables the Company to maintain an inventory financing agreement with a financial intermediary to facilitate the purchase of inventory from certain vendors on more favorable terms than offered directly by the vendors.
4.
Contract Liabilities and Remaining Performance Obligations



The Company's contract liabilities consist of payments received from customers, or such consideration that is contractually due, in advance of providing the product or performing services.
The Company's contract liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.
As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the contract liability balance was $194 million and $159 million, respectively.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized revenue of $58 million and $45 million, respectively, related to its contract liabilities.
For more information regarding the Company's performance obligations, see Note 1 (Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).
The following table represents the total transaction price for the remaining performance obligations as of March 31, 2018 related to non-cancelable contracts longer than 12 months in duration that is expected to be recognized over future periods.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



5.Financial Instruments



The Company's indebtedness creates interest rate risk on its variable-rate debt.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Company has interest rate cap agreements that entitle it to payments from the counterparty of the amount, if any, by which three-month LIBOR exceeds the strike rates of the caps during the agreement period in exchange for an upfront premium.
During the first quarter of 2018, the Company entered into interest rate cap agreements with a combined notional value of $1.4 billion resulting in premiums paid to the counterparties of $13 million.
As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had the following interest rate cap agreements for which the fair values are classified within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The fair value of the Company's interest rate cap agreements is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The valuation of the interest rate cap agreements is derived by using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rates of the caps.
This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the interest rate cap agreements, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including LIBOR curves and implied volatilities.
The Company also incorporates insignificant credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.
14

CDW CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



The counterparty credit spreads are based on publicly available credit information obtained from a third-party credit data provider.
For additional details, see Note 6 (Long-Term Debt).
The interest rate cap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into Interest expense in the period when the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
If a derivative is deemed to be ineffective, the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized directly into earnings.
The Company recorded a $3 million gain, net of a $1 million tax expense, for the effective portion of the interest rate cap agreements into Accumulated other comprehensive loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recorded an insignificant loss for the effective portion of the interest rate cap agreements into Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reclassified less than $1 million from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings within Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The Company expects to reclassify $5 million from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into Interest expense, net during the next twelve months.
Prior to the election of hedge accounting treatment, the Company recognized less than $1 million of Interest income during the three months ended March 31, 2017 in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations related to the changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements.

Borrowings under the Revolving Loan are limited by the borrowing base.
As of March 31, 2018, the Company could have borrowed up to an additional $987 million under the Revolving Loan.
Borrowings are also limited by a minimum liquidity condition, which provides that, if excess cash availability is less than the lower of (i) $125 million and (ii) the greater of (a) 10.0% of the borrowing base, and (b) $100 million, the lenders are not required to lend additional amounts under the Revolving Loan unless the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined, is at least 1.00 to 1.00.

These deferred financing fees are recorded in the Other assets line on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Senior Secured Term Loan Facility ("Term Loan")



As of March 31, 2018, the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan was $1.5 billion, excluding $2 million of deferred financing fees.
Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at either (i) the ABR plus a margin or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin, payable quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December.
