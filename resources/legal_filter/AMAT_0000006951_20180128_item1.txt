These unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Applied’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 29, 2017 (2017 Form 10-K).
Applied’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in October of each year.
Fiscal 2018 and 2017 each contain 52 weeks, and the first three months of fiscal 2018 and 2017 each contained 13 weeks.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
Revenue Recognition



Applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; seller’s price to buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is probable.
Applied’s shipping terms are customarily FOB Applied shipping point or equivalent terms.
Spare parts revenue is generally recognized upon shipment, and services revenue is generally recognized over the period that the services are provided.
The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.
Applied generally utilizes the ESP due to the nature of its products.
If the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software deliverable using the guidance for recognizing software revenue.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements



Accounting Standards Adopted



Inventory Measurement.
In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance that requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value instead of at lower of cost or market.
This guidance does not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method but applies to all other inventory including those measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or the average cost method.
Applied adopted this authoritative guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 prospectively to measurement of inventory after the effective date.
Share-Based Compensation.
Applied adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Upon adoption, Applied elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period.
Adopting this guidance increased cash provided by operating activities by a net $146 million with a corresponding net increase in cash used in financing activities for the three months ended January 29, 2017.
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted



Derivatives and Hedging.
In August 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that modifies the recognition and presentation of hedge accounting to better align an entity’s risk management strategies and financial reporting for hedging relationships.
The authoritative guidance expands the application of hedge accounting for non-financial and financial risk components and eases certain hedge effectiveness assessment requirements.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.
Applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.
Share-Based Compensation: Modification Accounting.
In May 2017, the FASB issued an update to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
This authoritative guidance will be applied prospectively to awards modified following adoption and will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted.
The impact of the adoption of this guidance will depend on whether the Company makes any future modifications of share-based payment awards.
Receivables: Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs.
In March 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that will shorten the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium to the earliest call date to more closely align with expectations incorporated in market pricing.
This authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 on a modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted.
Applied is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.
Retirement Benefits.
In March 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires companies to present the service cost component of net benefit cost in the same line items in which they report compensation cost.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted.
Goodwill Impairment.
In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that simplifies the process required to test goodwill for impairment.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
Early adoption is permitted.

Business Combinations.
In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarifies the definition of a business to help companies evaluate whether acquisition or disposal transactions should be accounted for as asset groups or as businesses.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted.
Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Asset Transfers.
In October 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires entities to recognize at the transaction date the income tax effects of intercompany asset transfers other than inventory.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
In August 2016, a new authoritative guidance was issued which addresses classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments related to the statement of cash flows.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Financial Instruments: Credit Losses.
In June 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that modifies the impairment model for certain financial assets by requiring use of an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
Early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.
Leases.
In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for lease accounting, which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for certain lease arrangements that are classified as operating leases under the previous standard, and to provide for enhanced disclosures.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and should be applied using a modified retrospective approach.
Early adoption is permitted.
Applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.
Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement.
In January 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires equity investments that do not result in consolidation, and are not accounted for under the equity method, to be measured at fair value, and requires recognition of any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for a new practicability exception.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Early adoption is permitted only for the provisions related to the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities caused by instrument-specific credit risk.
Applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition.
In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and requires certain additional disclosures.
This new standard will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
Entities will have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach to adopting the guidance.
In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date by one year and allow entities to early adopt no earlier than the original effective date.
With this amendment, the guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, which is the Company’s planned adoption date.
Applied currently anticipates adopting this new guidance using the full retrospective approach, although this continues to be assessed as part of the overall evaluation.
In fiscal 2016, Applied established a project steering committee and cross-functional implementation team to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to Applied’s revenue contracts.
In addition, the implementation team is also responsible for identifying and implementing changes to business processes, systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard.
While the Company’s evaluation of the impact of this new guidance is not complete, Applied currently expects the timing of revenue recognition for certain products to be earlier than under current revenue recognition guidance.

Note 2Earnings Per Share



Basic earnings per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares (representing the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase plan shares) outstanding during the period.
Applied’s net income has not been adjusted for any period presented for purposes of computing basic or diluted earnings per share due to the Company’s non-complex capital structure.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Potentially dilutive securities attributable to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share where the combined exercise price and average unamortized fair value are greater than the average market price of Applied common stock, and therefore their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
Prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09 related to share-based compensation, the assumed tax benefits upon the exercise of options and vesting of restricted stock units were also included in this calculation.

Gains and Losses on Investments



During the three months ended January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017, gross realized gains and losses on investments were not material.
At January 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017, gross unrealized losses related to Applied’s investment portfolio were not material.
Applied regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment.
Generally, the contractual terms of investments in marketable securities do not permit settlement at prices less than the amortized cost of the investments.
Applied determined that the gross unrealized losses on its marketable fixed-income securities at January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 were temporary in nature and therefore it did not recognize any impairment of its marketable fixed-income securities during the three months ended January 28, 2018 or January 29, 2017.
Impairment charges on equity investments in privately-held companies during the three months ended January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 were not material.
Note 4 Fair Value Measurements



Applied’s financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value, except for equity investments in privately-held companies.
These equity investments are generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting and are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when events or circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred.
Applied’s nonfinancial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost and are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Fair Value Hierarchy



Applied uses the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:



•Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;



•Level 2 — Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and



•Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Applied’s investments consist primarily of debt securities that are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at their fair values.
In determining the fair value of investments, Applied uses pricing information from pricing services that value securities based on quoted market prices and models that utilize observable market inputs.
In the event a fair value estimate is unavailable from a pricing service, Applied generally obtains non-binding price quotes from brokers.
Applied then reviews the information provided by the pricing services or brokers to determine the fair value of its short-term and long-term investments.
In addition, to validate pricing information obtained from pricing services, Applied periodically performs supplemental analysis on a sample of securities.
Applied reviews any significant unanticipated differences identified through this analysis to determine the appropriate fair value.
As of January 28, 2018, substantially all of Applied’s available-for-sale, short-term and long-term investments were recognized at fair value that was determined based upon observable inputs.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis



Financial assets (excluding cash balances) measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the three months ended January 28, 2018 or January 29, 2017.
Applied did not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis within Level 3 fair value measurements as of January 28, 2018 or October 29, 2017.
At January 28, 2018, equity investments in privately-held companies totaled $75 million, of which $65 million of these investments were accounted for under the cost method of accounting and $10 million of investments had been measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis within Level 3 fair value measurements due to an other-than-temporary decline in value.
At October 29, 2017, equity investments in privately-held companies totaled $74 million, of which $65 million of these investments were accounted for under the cost method of accounting and $9 million of investments had been measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis within Level 3 fair value measurements due to an other-than-temporary decline in value.
Impairment charges on equity investments in privately-held companies during the three months ended January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 were not material.
Other



The carrying amounts of Applied’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable - short term, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
At January 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017, the carrying amount of long-term debt was $5.3 billion and the estimated fair value was $5.8 billion.
The estimated fair value of long-term debt is determined by Level 2 inputs and is based primarily on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues.
See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further detail of existing debt.

Note 5Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities



Derivative Financial Instruments



Applied conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with certain transactions denominated in local currencies, such as the Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Taiwanese dollar.
Applied uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward exchange contracts and currency option contracts, to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur typically within the next 24 months.
The terms of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are generally consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged.
During fiscal 2017, Applied entered into and settled interest rate lock agreements, with a total notional amount of $700 million to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt.
These instruments were designated as cash flow hedges at inception and settled in conjunction with the issuance of debt in March 2017.
The $14 million loss from the settlement of the interest rate lock agreement, which was included in AOCI in stockholders’ equity, is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the senior unsecured 10-year notes issued in March 2017.
Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative instruments and hedging activities, including foreign currency exchange and interest rate contracts, are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value.
Hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the hedge as cash flow hedges and foreign exchange derivatives are typically entered into once per month.
Cash flow hedges are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly.
The majority of the after-tax net income or loss related to foreign exchange derivative instruments included in AOCI at January 28, 2018 is expected to be reclassified into earnings within 12 months.
Both ineffective hedge amounts and hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings.
The amount recognized due to discontinuance of cash flow hedges that were probable not to occur by the end of the originally specified time period was not significant for the three months ended January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017.
Additionally, forward exchange contracts are generally used to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities.
These derivatives are typically entered into once per month and are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these hedges are recorded in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.
The fair values of foreign exchange derivative instruments at January 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017 were not material.

Credit Risk Contingent Features



If Applied’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, it would be in violation of credit risk contingent provisions of the derivative instruments discussed above, and certain counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment on derivative instruments in net liability positions.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that were in a net liability position was immaterial as of January 28, 2018.
Entering into derivative contracts with banks exposes Applied to credit-related losses in the event of the banks’ nonperformance.

Note 6Accounts Receivable, Net 



Applied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers.
Applied sells its accounts receivable without recourse.
Applied, from time to time, also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions.
The discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements.
Applied sold $376 million and $63 million of accounts receivable during the three months ended January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017, respectively.
Applied did not discount letters of credit issued by customers or discount promissory notes during the three months ended January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017. Financing charges on the sale of receivables and discounting of letters of credit are included in interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations and were not material for all periods presented.
Accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $34 million at January 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017.
Applied sells its products principally to manufacturers within the semiconductor and display industries.

Note 8Goodwill, Purchased Technology and Other Intangible Assets



Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets



Applied’s methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established and generally accepted valuation techniques.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed.
Applied assigns assets acquired (including goodwill) and liabilities assumed to one or more reporting units as of the date of acquisition.
Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment, especially in emerging markets.
To test goodwill for impairment, Applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
If it is concluded that this is the case, Applied then performs the two-step goodwill impairment test.
Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required.
Under the two-step goodwill impairment test, Applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.
Applied determines the fair value of each of its reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches.
If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill.
If Applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, Applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference.
As of January 28, 2018, Applied’s reporting units include Semiconductor Product Group and Imaging and Process Control Group, which combine to form the Semiconductor Systems reporting segment, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets.
The evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment.
Details of goodwill as of January 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017 were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



A summary of Applied’s purchased technology and intangible assets is set forth below:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



Finite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets



Applied amortizes purchased intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from 1 to 15 years.
Applied evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable.
Applied assesses the fair value of the assets based on the amount of the undiscounted future cash flow that the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset, plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset.
When Applied identifies an impairment, Applied reduces the carrying value of the group of assets to comparable market values, when available and appropriate, or to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach.
Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition.
Applied evaluates the useful lives of its intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances require revising the remaining period of amortization.
Details of finite-lived intangible assets were as follows:

Note 9Borrowing Facilities and Debt



Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in September 2021.
This agreement provides for borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to one of various benchmark rates selected by Applied for each advance, plus a margin based on Applied’s public debt rating and includes financial and other covenants.
Remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $73 million are with Japanese banks.
Applied’s ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen.
No amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both January 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017, and Applied has not utilized these credit facilities.
In fiscal 2011, Applied established a short-term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion.
At January 28, 2018, Applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding.
Debt outstanding as of January 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017 was as follows:

Stock Repurchase Program



In September 2017, the Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing up to $3.0 billion in repurchases, which was in addition to a $2.0 billion common stock repurchase program approved in June 2016.
At January 28, 2018, $2.8 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase program.
In February 2018, the Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing up to an additional $6.0 billion in repurchases.
The following table summarizes Applied’s stock repurchases for the three months ended January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Applied records treasury stock purchases under the cost method using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
Upon reissuance of treasury stock, amounts in excess of the acquisition cost are credited to additional paid in capital.
If Applied reissues treasury stock at an amount below its acquisition cost and additional paid in capital associated with prior treasury stock transactions is insufficient to cover the difference between the acquisition cost and the reissue price, this difference is recorded against retained earnings.
Dividends



In December 2017, Applied’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.10 per share, to be paid in March 2018.
Dividends paid during the three months ended January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 totaled $106 million and $108 million, respectively.
Applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applied’s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of Applied’s stockholders.
In February 2018, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid in June 2018.
In addition, the plan provides for the automatic grant of restricted stock units to non-employee directors and permits the grant of share-based awards to non-employee directors and consultants.
Share-based awards made under the plan may be subject to accelerated vesting under certain circumstances in the event of a change in control of Applied.
Applied also has two Employee Stock Purchase Plans, one generally for United States employees and a second for employees of international subsidiaries (collectively, ESPP), which enable eligible employees to purchase Applied common stock.
During the three months ended January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017, Applied recognized share-based compensation expense related to stock options, ESPP shares, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units.
The effect of share-based compensation on the results of operations was as follows:

APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)



The cost associated with share-based awards that are subject solely to time-based vesting requirements, less expected forfeitures, is recognized over the awards’ service period for the entire award on a straight-line basis.
The cost associated with performance-based equity awards is recognized for each tranche over the service period, based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved.
At January 28, 2018, Applied had $481 million in total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to grants of share-based awards and shares issued under Applied’s ESPP, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.9 years.
At January 28, 2018, there were 82 million shares available for grants of share-based awards under the Employee Stock Incentive Plan, and an additional 20 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, certain executive officers were granted awards that are subject to the achievement of specified performance goals.
These awards become eligible to vest only if performance goals are achieved and will vest only if the grantee remains employed by Applied through each applicable vesting date.
Certain awards require the achievement of positive adjusted operating profit and vest ratably over three years.
Other awards require the achievement of targeted levels of adjusted operating margin and wafer fabrication equipment market share, and the number of shares that may vest in full after three years ranges from 0% to 200% of the target amount.
The fair value of these awards is estimated on the date of grant.
If the goals are achieved, the awards will vest, provided that the grantee remains employed by Applied through each applicable vesting date.
If the performance goals are not met as of the end of the performance period, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No.
SAB 118 provides a measurement period that will not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740.
Pursuant to this guidance, provisional adjustments were recorded when reasonable estimates could be determined.
No adjustments were recorded when reasonable estimates could not be determined.
These provisional estimates will be revised as information becomes available and as guidance is issued by the Internal Revenue Service.
A transition tax expense was recorded in the first fiscal quarter 2018 based on reasonable estimates of foreign subsidiaries E&P.
Additional information is being gathered to more precisely compute the transition tax which will be completed during the measurement period.
Since Applied has recorded provisional estimates related to certain portions of the Tax Act, any corresponding determination of the need for or change in a valuation allowance is also provisional.
Applied’s effective tax rates for the first quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017 were 88.4 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively.

Note 13Industry Segment Operations



Applied’s three reportable segments are: Semiconductor Systems, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets.
As defined under the accounting literature, Applied’s chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the President and Chief Executive Officer, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company.
Segment information is presented based upon Applied’s management organization structure as of January 28, 2018 and the distinctive nature of each segment.
Future changes to this internal financial structure may result in changes to Applied’s reportable segments.
The Semiconductor Systems reportable segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for etch, rapid thermal processing, deposition, chemical mechanical planarization, metrology and inspection, wafer packaging, and ion implantation.
The Applied Global Services segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, certain remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and other products.
Each operating segment is separately managed and has separate financial results that are reviewed by Applied’s chief operating decision-maker.
Each reportable segment contains closely related products that are unique to the particular segment.
Segment operating income is determined based upon internal performance measures used by Applied’s chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker does not evaluate operating segments using total asset information.
Applied derives the segment results directly from its internal management reporting system.
The accounting policies Applied uses to derive reportable segment results are substantially the same as those used for external reporting purposes.
Management uses these results to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the reportable segments.
These operating expenses include costs related to share-based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resources, and research, development and engineering functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy.
In addition, Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment.
Management does not consider the unallocated costs in measuring the performance of the reportable segments.
