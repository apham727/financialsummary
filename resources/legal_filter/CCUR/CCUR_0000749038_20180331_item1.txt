 1.Overview of Business and Basis of Presentation 
References herein to “CCUR Holdings,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to CCUR Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically indicates otherwise. CCUR Holdings was formerly known as Concurrent Computer Corporation and changed its name on January 2, 2018. 
On December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our content delivery and storage business (the “Content Delivery business”) and other related assets to Vecima Networks, Inc. (“Vecima”) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 13, 2017, between the Company and Vecima. Substantially all liabilities associated with the Content Delivery business were assigned to Vecima as part of the transaction. The Content Delivery business provided advanced applications focused on storing, protecting, transforming, and delivering high value media assets and served industries and customers that demand uncompromising performance, reliability and flexibility to gain a competitive edge, drive meaningful growth and confidently deliver best-in-class solutions that enrich the lives of millions of people around the world every day. The Content Delivery business consisted of (1) software, hardware and services for intelligently streaming video content to a variety of consumer devices and storing and managing content in the network and (2) Aquari™ Storage, a unified scale-out storage solutions product that is ideally suited for a wide range of enterprise IT and video applications that require advanced performance, very large storage capacities, and a high degree of reliability. 
In May 2017, we sold our Real-Time business consisting of real-time Linux operating system versions, development and performance optimization tools, simulation software and other system software combined, in many cases, with computer platforms and services. These real-time products were sold to a wide variety of companies seeking high performance, real-time computer solutions in the defense, aerospace, financial and automotive markets around the world. 
Smaller Reporting Company 
We meet the SEC’s definition of a “Smaller Reporting Company,” and therefore qualify for the SEC’s reduced disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies. 
Use of Estimates 
Investments  
The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Debt securities for which the Company does not have the intent or ability to hold to maturity are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded as either short term or long term in the condensed consolidated balance sheet based on contractual maturity date and are stated at amortized cost. Marketable securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported as fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings. Debt and marketable equity securities not classified as held-to-maturity or as trading, are classified as available-for-sale, and are carried at fair market value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in the determination of comprehensive income (loss) and reported in stockholders’ equity. 
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”). ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Clarification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (“ASU 2016-15”), which eliminates the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows, by adding or clarifying guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, unless deemed impracticable, in which case, prospective application is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01 - Business Combinations (Topic 805) (“ASU 2017-01”), which clarifies the definition of a business. For accounting and financial reporting purposes, businesses are generally comprised of three elements; inputs, processes, and outputs. Integrated sets of assets and activities capable of providing these three elements may not always be considered a business, and the lack of one of the three elements does not always disqualify the set from being a business. The issuance of ASU 2017-01 provides a clarifying screen to determine when a set of assets and activities is not a business. Primarily, the screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. The amendments contained in ASU 2017-01 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and may be early adopted for certain transactions that have occurred before the effective date, but only when the underlying transaction has not been reported in the financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. We do not expect ASU 2017-01 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures unless we enter into a business combination. 
 3.Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share 
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares, including dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during each period. Under the treasury stock method, incremental shares representing the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued are included in the computation. Due to the loss from continuing operations for all periods presented, common share equivalents of 9,614 and 238,696 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and common share equivalents of 216,791 and 250,441 for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively,were excluded from the calculation as their effect was anti-dilutive. 
Content Delivery business 
As noted above, on December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our Content Delivery business and other related assets to Vecima pursuant to an Asset Purchase agreement, dated as of October 13, 2017, between the Company and Vecima (the “CDN APA”) for a purchase price of $29,000 (subject to an adjustment for net working capital). The sale included our Content Delivery business assets and related liabilities in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, as well as the sale of all equity in our Japanese subsidiary. 
During the third quarter of our fiscal 2018, we and Vecima finalized the calculation of net working capital of the Content Delivery business as of December 31, 2017. We and Vecima agreed the surplus net working capital transferred to Vecima under the CDN APA was $812, and as a result, we returned $658 to Vecima. We reduced our gain on the sale of the Content Delivery business as reported during the period ended December 31, 2017 by the amount of the final post-closing working capital adjustment. Additionally, we incurred approximately $55 of additional costs related to the transaction during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2018, primarily due to legal and disclosure expenses attributable to the transaction. 
In conjunction with the CDN APA, we and Vecima entered into a Transition Services Agreements (the “CDN TSA”) for the U.S. Under the CDN TSA, we and Vecima have each agreed to provide and receive various services to and from the other party on an arms-length, fee-for-service basis for a term of twelve months as of the date of the closing, unless terminated earlier by either party. Net amounts charged from the Purchaser under the TSAs for both the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 were $63 and are recorded within operating expenses. 
Results associated with the Content Delivery business are classified within income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Operating expenses recorded in discontinued operations include costs incurred directly in support of the Content Delivery business. 
The closing of the sale of the assets to Vecima resulted in a “change in control” under our Amended and Restated 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. As a result, the Company recognized expense of approximately $1,745 in share-based compensation expense due to the acceleration of the vesting and the lapse of restrictions on substantially all restricted stock granted under our Amended and Restated 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (see Note 7 – Share-based Compensation). This expense is reflected in general and administrative expenses of continuing operations in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018. Payment of associated accrued dividends related to these released shares was made in January 2018. 
Transaction costs directly associated with the sale of the Content Delivery business include legal, accounting, investment banking and other fees paid to external parties. 
In connection with the sale of our Content Delivery business (1) we entered into a Separation and Consulting Agreement and General Release of Claims with Derek Elder, our former President and Chief Executive Officer, as a result of which (A) Mr. Elder’s role as president and chief executive officer was terminated, (B) Mr. Elder ceased to be a member of our Board of Directors and all committees thereof, and (C) we recorded severance related expenses of $544 pursuant to his Separation and Consulting Agreement (see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies – Separation of Chief Executive Officer), (2) we terminated the employment of another executive of the Company and recorded severance expenses of $132, (3) we paid transaction bonuses that had previously been approved by our compensation committee of $479 to internal executives and staff and (4) we accepted the resignation of an independent director of the Company (see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies – Resignation of Directors). All of the above expenses were recorded as of December 31, 2017 and are included in general and administrative expenses of continuing operations in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2018. 
Real-Time business 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly fashion between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be either recorded or disclosed at fair value, we consider the most advantageous market in which it would transact and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. 
Our investment portfolio consists of money market funds, domestic and international commercial paper, equity securities and corporate debt. All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents. All cash equivalents are carried at cost less any unamortized premium or discount, which approximates fair value. All investments with original maturities of more than three months are classified as available-for-sale investments. Our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Interest on securities is recorded in interest income. Any realized gains or losses would be shown in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in other income or expense. We provide fair value measurements disclosures of our available-for-sale securities in accordance with one of the three levels of fair value measurement. We have no financial assets that are measured on a recurring basis that fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
Equity Securities. The balance consists of common stock of publicly traded companies. The fair values of publicly traded equity securities are based on quoted market prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. 
Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Available-for-Sale Investments 
Maturities of Fixed Maturity Securities Available-for-Sale 
The amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity securities available-for-sale as of March 31, 2018 are shown by contractual maturity in the table below. Actual maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 
For both the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, the domestic tax expense is lower than the prior year primarily due to the favorable impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (enacted on December 22, 2017) on the realizability of our alternative minimum tax credits and lower domestic income as compared to the same periods from the prior year. 
Net Operating Losses 
In the third quarter of our fiscal 2018, we completed an evaluation of the potential effect of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”) on our ability to utilize these net operating losses (the “Section 382 Study”). The Section 382 Study concluded that we have not had an ownership change for the period from July 22, 1993 to February 8, 2018. The Section 382 Study also analyzed various hypothetical ownership changes to enable us to monitor and evaluate our ownership base for any potential impairment of the NOLs on an ongoing basis. If we experience an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the IRC, our ability to use these NOLs will be substantially limited, which could therefore significantly impair the value of that asset. See section below entitled “Tax Asset Preservation Plan” for details regarding steps we have taken to protect the value of our NOLs. 
We also have State NOLs that expire according to the rules of each state and expiration will occur between fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2036 and foreign NOLs that expire according to the rules of each country. Currently, none of the jurisdictions in which we have foreign NOLs are subject to expiration due to indefinite carryforward periods. 
Deferred Tax Assets and Related Valuation Allowances 
 1.If analysis of the impact of the new law is completed by the time the financial statements are issued, then the impact should be included in the financial statements. 
 2.If only certain aspects of the new law are completed by the time the financial statements are issued but other aspects and other aspects are incomplete but able to be reasonably estimated, then the registrant should include both the certain aspects and a reasonable estimate of the incomplete aspects in its financial statements. This reasonable estimate should be reported as a “provisional amount” during a “measurement period” not to exceed one year from the date of the enactment of the new law. 
Unrecognized Tax Benefits 
We have evaluated our unrecognized tax benefits and determined that there has not been a material change in the amount of such benefits for the nine months ended March 31, 2018. 
Research and Development Tax Credits 
During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, we recognized $0 and $274, respectively, of the state of Georgia credit and reduced operating expenses accordingly. As of March 31, 2018, State tax credit assets of of $575 and $26 are reflected within other current assets and other long-term assets, respectively, and unrecogized income from these credits of $142 and $12 are reflected in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. As of March 31, 2018 we have not received any proceeds from utilization of our State tax credits and we have not received any assurance as to if, or when, we will receive such proceeds. 
Tax Asset Preservation Plan 
At our 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on October 26, 2016, our stockholders adopted a formal amendment to our certificate of incorporation (the “Protective Amendment”) to deter any person acquiring 4.9% or more of the outstanding Common Stock without the approval of our Board in order to protect the value of our NOLs. The Protective Amendment was extended by our stockholders at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on October 25, 2017 and will expire on the earliest of (i) the Board of Directors’ determination that the Protective Amendment is no longer necessary for the preservation of the Company’s NOLs because of the amendment or repeal of Section 382 or any successor statute, (ii) the close of business on the first day of any taxable year of CCUR Holdings to which the Board of Directors determines that none of our NOLs may be carried forward (iii) such date as the Board of Directors otherwise determines that the Protective Amendment is no longer necessary for the preservation of the Company’s NOLs and (iv) the date of our Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held during calendar year 2018. 
As indicated in our Form 8-K filed on February 15, 2018, the Company executed and delivered the Amended Consent and Limited Waiver to the Standstill Agreement, filed therewith as Exhibit 10.1 (the “Amended Consent and Limited Waiver”), to JDS1, LLC and Julian Singer (together with their affiliates and associates, the “Investor Group”). The Consent and Limited Waiver provides that so long as (i) the Investor Group collectively beneficially own no more than 30.0% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company and (ii) any acquisition of common stock of the Company by the Investor Group would not reasonably be expected to limit the Company’s ability to utilize the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards, the Company shall not deem the Investor Group to have effected a Prohibited Transfer as that term is defined in the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation. 
As indicated in our Form 8-K filed on April 25, 2018, the Amended Consent and Limited Waiver was subsequently amended to provide that so long as (i) the Investor Group collectively beneficially own no more than 35.0% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company less the remaining shares of Common Stock that the Company is authorized to purchase under its stock repurchase program as announced on March 5, 2018, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to one million of its outstanding shares of Common Stock and (ii) any acquisition of common stock of the Company by the Investor Group would not reasonably be expected to actually limit the Company’s ability to utilize the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards, the Company shall not deem the Investor Group to have effected a Prohibited Transfer as that term is defined in the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation. 
In conjunction with the resignation of three of our independent directors in July 2017 (see Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies – Resignation of Directors), we accelerated the vesting of 5,400 shares of restricted stock held by each of the resigning directors. This acceleration of vesting resulted in incremental stock compensation expense of $37 during the nine months ended March 31, 2018. 
All remaining share-based compensation expense for the three and nine-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 resulted from vesting of shares over their respective vesting periods. 
 9.Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits 
We maintain a retirement savings plan available to U.S. employees that qualifies as a defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. We match 50% of the first 5% of the participants’ compensation invested by the employee in the 401(k) plan. We made matching contributions of $4 and $4 during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $17 and $16 during the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
We contributed $3 and $3 to our German defined benefit pension plans for the three months ending March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $11 and $10 for the nine months ending March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect to make an additional, similar, quarterly contribution during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2018. 
 10.Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses 
On October 27, 2017, we announced the Board of Directors’ decision to suspend the Company’s quarterly dividend following the payment of the December 28, 2017 dividend to preserve the Company’s liquidity while the Investment Committee considers potential acquisition targets and alternative uses of the Company’s remaining assets, including the proceeds of the Vecima transaction. The Board of Directors will continue to regularly assess our allocation of capital and evaluate whether and when to reinstate the quarterly or other special dividend. 
For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, $8 of dividends payable were forfeited and returned to capital for restricted shares that were forfeited prior to meeting vesting requirements. Because the participants are not entitled to these dividends unless they complete the requisite service period for the shares to vest, they are not “participating dividends” as defined under ASC Topic 260-10, Earnings per Share. 
 13.Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss  
Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other employees, employment may be terminated by either the respective executive officer or us at any time. In the event the employee voluntarily resigns (except as described below) or is terminated for cause, compensation under the employment agreement will end. In the event an agreement is terminated by us without cause or in certain circumstances constructively by us, the terminated employee will receive severance compensation for a period from 6 to 12 months, depending on the employee, in an annualized amount equal to the respective employee's base salary then in effect. At March 31, 2018, the maximum contingent liability under these agreements is $437. 
On January 30, 2018, the Company entered into a “First Amendment to Employment Agreement” with its CFO (the “First Amendment”) amending certain terms of the Employment Agreement entered into with its CFO on May 15, 2017. Pursuant to the First Amendment, the CFO’s employment will run through December 31, 2018 unless it is terminated earlier in accordance with the Employment Agreement. In the event of the CFO’s termination without “due cause” (as defined in the Employment Agreement), he will be entitled to receive a severance package consisting of (i) salary continuation payments for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of such termination at his most recent salary rate, (ii) the amount, if any, paid as an annual bonus in the year preceding termination, and (iii) COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’s hospitalization and medical plan and for the 12-month period following termination, he and his eligible dependents at the time of termination will be eligible to continue coverage at the same premium charged to active employees. 
As a part of the First Amendment, if the CFO has a constructive termination of his employment without Due Cause during the term of the Employment Agreement, as amended, or within one year of a “change of control” (as defined in the Company’s Amended and Restated 2011 Stock Incentive Plan), subject to executing an irrevocable release, the CFO will be entitled to receive a severance package consisting of (i) salary continuation payments for a period of (A) nine (9) months in the event that the CFO provides written notice of a constructive termination to the Company prior to the filing of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, or (B) twelve (12) months in the event that the CFO provides written notice of a constructive termination to the Company at any time during the period commencing on the day following the filing of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2018, in either instance at his most recent salary rate, (ii) the amount, if any, paid as an annual bonus in the year preceding the CFO’s termination, and (iii) COBRA continuation coverage under the Company’s hospitalization and medical plan and for the 9-month or 12-month period, as the case may be, following termination he will be eligible to continue coverage, including his eligible dependents at the time of termination, at the same premium charged to active employees. 
Separation of Chief Executive Officer 
The consideration paid to the CEO under the Separation Agreement is in lieu of any change of control or other consideration payable to him under his previous employment agreement. The Separation Agreement contains a general release of claims against us and other “Released Parties” by the CEO and a covenant not to sue such Released Parties. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, the CEO is required to comply with certain restrictive covenants regarding non-disclosure of Company information, non-disparagement, non-competition and non-solicitation of our customers and employees. 
As reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 14, 2017, three of our independent directors resigned from our Board of Directors and all committees, effective as of July 14, 2017. In connection therewith, the Board approved a reduction in the size of the Board of Directors from seven (7) to four (4) directors. The resignations of such directors did not involve any disagreement with the Board of Directors, the Company or its management on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices. In connection with these resignations, we agreed to accelerate the vesting of 5,400 shares of restricted stock held by each of the resigning directors (including an aggregate of $7 of accrued dividends released upon the acceleration of the vesting of the restricted stock), and to make a one-time payment to each of the resigning directors of $52, which includes unpaid meeting fees through the date of resignation. Additionally, as reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 31, 2017, the Board approved an increase in the size of the Board of Directors from four (4) to five (5) members and added one new independent director. 
Another independent director, Robert Pons, tendered his resignation from the Board of Directors and all committees thereof effective December 31, 2017. The resignation of Mr. Pons did not involve any disagreement with the Board of Directors, the Company or its management on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices. In connection with his release of any claims against us, we agreed to accelerate the vesting of 7,500 shares of restricted stock held by Mr. Pons as of December 31, 2017. As reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on February 14, 2018, Mr. Pons was replaced by the addition of a new independent director on February 8, 2018. 
In connection with Mr. Pons’ resignation from the Board of Directors, we entered into a Consulting Agreement (the “Consulting Agreement”) with Spartan Advisors, Inc. ("Spartan"), a corporation owned and controlled Mr. Pons. Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, Spartan will provide consulting services to us as reasonably requested by the Board of Directors, which services shall include identifying and presenting investment opportunities to the Company within the parameters provided by the Board from time to time. During the term of the Consulting Agreement, which will run from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, Spartan will be paid an aggregate of $85,000 in twelve monthly installments. Spartan will also be eligible to receive an “Incentive Transaction Bonus” (as defined in the Consulting Agreement upon the consummation of any acquisition (as defined in the Consulting Agreement, a “Sourced Transaction”) of an entity or business (as defined in the Consulting Agreement, a “Sourced Business”) by us that Spartan sourced and introduced to us during the term of the Consulting Agreement. Any transaction bonus payable to Spartan will equal the sum of (i) 1% of the total consideration paid by us for the Sourced Business in the Sourced Transaction and (ii) 7.5% of the “Net Asset Value” (as defined in the Consulting Agreement) of any subsequent sale of the Sourced Business by the Company. Each portion of the Incentive Transaction Bonus shall be paid in a lump sum cash payment no later than thirty (30) days following the consummation of the applicable transaction. Spartan will also receive 7,500 shares of restricted units of common stock of the Company, which will vest in equal installments on the first, second, and third anniversary of the Consulting Agreement. 
From April 1, 2018 through May 3, 2018 we purchased an additional 354,336 shares of the Company’s stock at an average price of $5.03 per share under our stock purchase plan further described in footnote 11. 
Item 1A. Risk Factors 
We may be subject to lawsuits relating to Section 16 of the Exchange Act based on certain transactions in our common stock and derivative securities referencing our common stock. 
In the past, our largest stockholder, JDS1, LLC has disgorged “short-swing” profits to the Company, which is a term that describes certain profits of Section 16 reporting persons realized from transactions in common stock or derivative securities during a specified time period that are subject to disgorgement under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The Company continuously reviews transactions by JDS1, LLC (and other Section 16 reporting persons to the extent such transactions occur) in our common stock and derivative securities referencing our common stock for additional transactions that may be subject to Section 16 and require disgorgement. We have received letters from lawyers purporting to represent stockholders of the Company regarding additional transactions of JDS1, LLC. Our Board of Directors has established a special committee consisting of directors David Nicol and Dilip Singh to review whether any additional amounts are subject to disgorgement from JDS1, LLC under Section 16 of the Exchange Act and to oversee recovery of any such amounts. While the Company has taken the steps described above to address transactions of Section 16 reporting persons, there can be no assurance that related litigation will not arise, including litigation initiated by the stockholders that have contacted the Company regarding these transactions. Any related litigation that arises may require the Company to expend significant financial and managerial resources.
