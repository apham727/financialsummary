Overview 
On December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our Content Delivery business to Vecima. Prior to this transaction, we sold streaming, video processing and storage products and services to media service providers to support consumer-facing video applications including live broadcast video, video-on-demand and time-shifted television services such as cloud-based digital video recording. 
In May 2017, we sold our Real-Time business to the RT Purchaser. The Real-Time business provided real-time Linux operating system variants, development and performance optimization tools, simulation software and other system software combined, in many cases, with computer platforms and services. Prior to the sale, we sold our Real-Time business products to a wide variety of companies seeking high performance, real-time computer solutions in the defense, aerospace, financial and automotive markets around the world. 
Recent Events 
Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement we entered into with Vecima on December 15, 2017, we received $29.02 million on the December 31, 2017 closing date, based upon the agreed upon sale price, which included $1.47 million for previously estimated working capital expected to transfer to Vecima above an agreed upon working capital target. During the third quarter of our fiscal 2018, we and Vecima finalized the calculation of net working capital of the Content Delivery business as of December 31, 2017. We and Vecima agreed that the surplus net working capital transferred to Vecima under the CDN APA was $812 thousand, and as a result, we returned $658 thousand to Vecima. We reduced our gain on the sale of the Content Delivery business reported during the period ended December 31, 2017 by the amount of the final post-closing working capital adjustment, so our third quarter return of excess working capital payment did not result in an additional third quarter adjustment to our gain on the transaction. Pursuant to our Escrow Agreement with Vecima, $1.45 million of the purchase price (not included above) will be held by SunTrust Bank as security for our indemnification obligations to Vecima under the CDN APA, which amount will be released to us on or before December 31, 2018 (less any portion used to make indemnification payments to Vecima). 
The closing of the sale of the Content Delivery business to Vecima resulted in a “change in control” under our Amended and Restated 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. As a result, we have recognized the acceleration of the vesting and the lapse of restrictions on substantially all restricted stock granted under our Amended and Restated 2011 Stock Incentive Plan and payment of any associated accrued dividends in connection with the consummation of the sale of the Content Delivery business to Vecima. 
On December 31, 2017 we entered into a Separation and Consulting Agreement and General Release of Claims with Derek Elder, whereby Mr. Elder’s role as president and CEO of the Company terminated and he ceased to be a member of our Board of Directors and all committees thereof, effective on December 31, 2017. Mr. Elder’s separation from the Company did not involve any disagreement with the Board of Directors, the Company or its management on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices. In addition, as described more fully in Item 1, Section 12 herein, on December 31, 2017, an independent member of our Board of Directors, Robert Pons, tendered his resignation from the Board of Directors and all committees thereof. Mr. Pons’ resignation from the Board of Directors did not involve any disagreement with the Board of Directors, the Company or its management on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices. 
On January 2, 2018, we changed our Company name to “CCUR Holdings, Inc.” and launched a new website located at www.ccurholdings.com. Effective March 27, 2018, we transitioned to trading on the OTCQB Venture Market under the same “CCUR” ticker symbol that we previously traded under on the Nasdaq market. 
On February 8, 2018, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. David Nicol as a new board member and appointed Mr. Nicol as Audit Committee Chairman, and Audit Committee Financial Expert, replacing Wayne Barr, Jr. in those positions, and as a member of the Compensation and Nominating committees. Mr. Nicol is a seasoned Board Director and advisor for technology-based businesses who currently serves on three other boards, two privately held and one public, the latter for which he chairs both Audit and Compensation Committees. Mr. Nicol is an active member of the National Association of Corporate Directors and Financial Executives International. 
Results of Operations for the Three months ended March 31, 2018 Compared to the Three months ended March 31, 2017 
General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 45.9%, from $2.2 million for the prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to approximately $0.9 million in legal and accounting fees that we incurred in the third quarter of our prior year related to the transaction to sell our Real-Time business that was not consummated until the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. Additionally, our third quarter of fiscal 2018 share based compensation expense decreased by approximately $0.1 million relative to the same period in the prior year due to 1) the acceleration of restricted share vesting that occurred with the change of control triggered by the sale of our Content Delivery business as of December 31, 2017 and 2) the limited number of remaining share-based compensation participants following the sale of both our Content Delivery and Real-Time businesses. 
Loss from Continuing Operations. Our loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.8 million, or $0.09 loss per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $2.2 million, or $0.24 loss per basic and diluted share. 
Results of Operations for the Nine months ended March 31, 2018 Compared to the Nine months ended March 31, 2017 
Interest Income. Interest income in both periods is comprised primarily of interest income available-for-sale investments. Interest income increased in the current period relative to the prior period due to our increase in cash and available-for-sale investments as a result of the sale of our Real-Time business in May 2017 and Content Delivery business in December 2017. 
Loss from Continuing Operations. Our loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was $5.1 million, or $0.53 loss per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 of $5.2 million, or $0.56 loss per basic and diluted share. The period-over-period decrease in basic and diluted loss per share resulted from a period-over period increase in weighted average shares outstanding. 
 ·our future access to capital; 
 ·our exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives; 
 ·the number of countries in which we operate, which may require maintenance of minimum cash levels in each country and, in certain cases, may restrict the repatriation of cash, by requiring us to maintain levels of capital; 
 ·our ongoing operating expenses; and 
 ·potential liquidation of the company pursuant to an organized plan of liquidation. 
We used $7.6 million and generated $2.2 million of cash from operating activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Operating cash flows during the nine months ending March 31, 2018 were primarily attributable to the timing of payments made against our accounts payable to settle the previous year’s transaction costs related to the sale of our Real-Time business, inventory purchases and accrued compensation, coupled with losses from continuing operations. Operating cash flows during the nine months ended March 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to the collection of accounts receivable for sales shipped late in the prior year, offset by the current period net loss. 
Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
During the nine months ended March 31, 2018, we generated $28.3 million of cash from the sale of our Content Delivery business and $11.7 million of cash from the maturity of available-for-sale securities. During the same period, we invested $18.6 million in available-for-sale investments. Subsequent to the sale of our Content Delivery business, we broadened our investment portfolio from mostly short-term government securities and commercial paper to also include corporate debt and equity securities. This shift in investments was for the purpose of improving our return on the proceeds from the recent sales of our operating businesses while we evaluate strategic alternatives. During the same period in the prior year, we invested $2.4 million in highly liquid commercial paper and U.S. Treasury bills with original maturities of more than 3 months but no more than 12 months. 
On January 2, 2018, we purchased 41,566 shares from certain non-Section 16 employees whose shares vested due to the change in control triggered by the sale of our Content Delivery business on December 31, 2017. The $239 thousand repurchase of shares at $5.76 per share was approved by the Board of Directors on a one-time basis to facilitate employees’ payment of payroll withholding taxes due upon vesting of the shares. Shares were repurchased from employees only to the extent required to fund minimum required withholding taxes based on the closing price nearest to the December 31, 2017 vest date. 
Although we do not have any outstanding debt or borrowing facilities in place at March 31, 2018, we periodically review the need for credit arrangements. Based upon our existing cash balances, historical cash usage, and anticipated operating cash flow in the near term, we believe that existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital, capital expenditure requirements and any dividend payments for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of this quarterly report. 
We had working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $62 million and $61.1 million of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments at March 31, 2018, compared to working capital of $45.3 million and $42.3 million cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments at June 30, 2017. At March 31, 2018, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures. 
As of March 31, 2018, less than 0.1% of our cash is in foreign accounts and there is no expectation that any foreign cash would need to be transferred from these foreign accounts to cover U.S. operations in the next 12 months. Based upon our existing cash balances and available-for-sale-term investments, historical cash usage, and anticipated operating cash flow in the current fiscal year, we believe that existing U.S. cash balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. 
We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2018.
