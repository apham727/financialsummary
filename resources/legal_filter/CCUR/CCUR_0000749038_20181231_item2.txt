References herein to “CCUR Holdings,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to CCUR Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically indicates otherwise. CCUR Holdings was formerly known as Concurrent Computer Corporation and changed its name on January 2, 2018. 
The Investment Committee, a special sub-committee of the Board, was established in December 2017 upon the signing of the CDN APA for the purpose of considering alternative means to deploy the proceeds of the sale of the Content Delivery business and other corporate assets to maximize long-term value for our stockholders. Such alternatives include, but are not limited to, evaluating opportunities to acquire all or a controlling interest in one or more operating businesses or assets intended to provide attractive returns for our stockholders and that are intended to result in appreciation in value, a more liquid trading market for our stock, and enhance our ability to utilize our existing U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”). Other than the restrictions set forth in the relevant non-competition and non-solicitation agreement executed by the Company in connection with the disposition of our prior operations, there are no restrictions on the transactions that we can pursue, including with respect to industry sector and geographic location. During fiscal year 2019, the Board dissolved the Investment Committee and established an Asset Management Committee as a standing committee of the Board. The Asset Management Committee, among other things, continues the work of the former Investment Committee by providing oversight of the Company’s acquisition process and also manages the Company’s ongoing operations and assets (including continued expansion and development of its real estate operations) and those of any subsequently acquired businesses. 
In December 2018, we entered into an arrangement with a leading MCA originator to participate in funding MCAs. We made an initial advance of $5.0 million to the originator (the “Initial MCA Advance”), who in turn advanced these funds to merchants as part of a syndication. MCAs are contracts formed through a future receivables or receipts purchase and sale agreement, which stipulates the purchase price, or the amount advanced, and the specified amount, or the advance amount plus the factored receivable balance the Company will be repaid, on the face of the contract. Generally, a specified amount will be withdrawn from the merchant’s bank account via daily or weekly ACH in order to pay down the merchant’s advance. These are not consumer loan contracts, nor are they installment loan contracts to businesses for business use only. In addition, there is no monthly minimum payment, nor is there a specific repayment schedule. As of December 31, 2018, our revenue and receivables from MCAs were derived from a single MCA originator with which we funded, in syndication, more than 100 advances to merchants. 
Pursuant to the LOI, the Company will acquire the interest in LuxeMark for a combination of up to $6 million in cash and equity, each payable over four years and subject to the achievement of prescribed financial performance milestones by LuxeMark. Additionally, the Company intends to fund up to $10 million in MCA capital, including through the Initial MCA Advance, which LuxeMark facilitated and for which LuxeMark provides certain servicing. The acquisition and deployment of any remaining MCA capital are subject to a number of conditions including the negotiation of definitive documentation and completion of CCUR’s due diligence investigation to CCUR’s satisfaction. 
We expect that the proposed transaction with LuxeMark will provide the Company with two revenue streams generated through (i) the Company’s 80% interest and thereby its pro-rated portion of the fee income earned by LuxeMark on its syndicators’ invested capital and (ii) returns received on funds the Company makes available as a LuxeMark syndicator or lender. 
The allowance for credit losses for MCAs is established at the time of purchase through a provision for losses charged to our statement of operations based on historical performance experienced by a peer group. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the future collection of principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. 
Interest Income on Commercial Loans. We created Recur Holdings LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. Through Recur Holdings LLC we conduct, hold and manage our existing and future real estate operations. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we earned $0.2 million of interest income on seven mortgage and other commercial loans with a weighted average annualized yield of 11.0%. 
MCA Income. In December 31, 2018, we began participating in the MCA industry by indirectly advancing funds to merchants through a third-party originator that is a leader in the MCA sector. We generated $0.2 million of income from MCAs during the period and expect to fund additional MCAs in the remaining quarters of our fiscal year 2019. 
 ·a $1.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense resulting from the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock awards in the prior year due to the change of control triggered by the sale of our Content Delivery business on December 31, 2017;  
 ·a $0.7 million decrease in bonuses due primarily to the non-recurring bonuses paid in the prior year period for the completion of the sale of our Content Delivery business; and  
 ·a $0.6 million decrease in severance related to our former CEO that was terminated in conjunction with the sale of our Content Delivery business on December 31, 2017.  
At this time, we do not expect a significant increase in expenses for our operations as our management team believes it can manage the business without adding significant staffing resources. 
Provision for Credit Losses. We established a provision for credit losses specifically for the MCAs that we began participating in during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2019. The allowance for credit losses for MCAs is established at the time of purchase through a provision for losses charged to our statement of operations based on historical performance experienced by an industry peer group. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the future collection of principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. 
 ·accretion of discounts on purchased debt securities.  
Dividend income. In the latter half of our fiscal year 2018, we began investing a portion of our business sale proceeds in equity securities, some of which declared and paid dividends during the three months ended December 31, 2018. 
Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes. We sold the Content Delivery business on December 31, 2017.

Interest Income on Commercial Loans. We created Recur Holdings LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. Through Recur Holdings LLC we conduct, hold and manage our existing and future real estate operations. During the six months ended December 31, 2018, we earned $0.3 million of interest income on eight mortgage and other commercial loans with an average aggregate carrying value of $5.4 million during the period and a weighted average annualized yield of 10.9%. 
MCA Income. In December 2018, we began participating in the MCA industry by indirectly advancing funds to merchants through a third-party originator that is a leader in the MCA sector.

 ·a $1.9 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, primarily resulting from the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock awards in the prior year due to the change of control triggered by the sale of our Content Delivery business on December 31, 2017;  
 ·a $0.8 million decrease in bonuses due primarily to the non-recurring bonuses paid in the prior year period for the completion of the sale of our Content Delivery business, and secondarily for annual incentive plan bonuses for operating results for the first half of the prior fiscal year;  
 ·a $0.6 million decrease in severance primarily related to our former CEO that was terminated in conjunction with the sale of our Content Delivery business on December 31, 2017;  
 ·a $0.3 million decrease in personnel costs, as we have reduced the number of employees from continuing operations subsequent to the sale of the Content Delivery business; and  
 ·a $0.2 million decrease in Board fees. In the first quarter of our prior fiscal year we incurred fees attributable to the resignation of three of our independent directors that did not recur in the current year period. Additionally, in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year we reduced certain recurring Board fees for our remaining Board members.  
At this time, we do not expect a significant increase in expenses for our operations as our management team believes it can manage the business without adding significant staffing resources.

 ·potential liquidation of the Company pursuant to an organized plan of liquidation.  
In December 2018, we entered into an arrangement with a leading MCA originator to participate in funding its MCA originations. We made an initial advance of $5 million to the originator, who in turn advanced these funds to merchants as part of a syndication. As advances have been collected from the merchants, we have used the collected funds to fund additional MCAs. Through December 31, 2018, we have funded $5.9 million in MCAs and collected $0.9 million of merchant receivables as repayment for these advances. Additionally, we provided a $2 million cash advance to an aviation business to fund the deposit required for the recipient’s aircraft purchases for up to six months, in exchange for paying us an upfront fee. 
In the prior fiscal year six-month period, we paid two quarterly cash dividends, each for $0.12 per share, and $2.3 million in aggregate. On October 27, 2017, we announced the Board of Directors’ decision to suspend future dividends after the payment of the December 2017 quarterly dividend while the Board considers potential acquisition targets and alternative uses of our remaining assets. 
We had working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $50.7 million at December 31, 2018, compared to working capital of $55.3 million at June 30, 2018. At December 31, 2018, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures. 
As of December 31, 2018, less than 1.0% of our cash was in foreign accounts and there is no expectation that any foreign cash would need to be transferred from these foreign accounts to cover U.S. operations in the next 12 months. Based upon our existing cash balances, equity securities and available-for-sale-term investments, historical cash usage, and anticipated operating cash flow in the current fiscal year, we believe that existing U.S. cash balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of this report. 
We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2018.
