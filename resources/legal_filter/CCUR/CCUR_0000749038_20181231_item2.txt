Overview 
The Investment Committee, a special sub-committee of the Board, was established in December 2017 upon the signing of the CDN APA for the purpose of considering alternative means to deploy the proceeds of the sale of the Content Delivery business and other corporate assets to maximize long-term value for our stockholders. Such alternatives include, but are not limited to, evaluating opportunities to acquire all or a controlling interest in one or more operating businesses or assets intended to provide attractive returns for our stockholders and that are intended to result in appreciation in value, a more liquid trading market for our stock, and enhance our ability to utilize our existing U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”). Other than the restrictions set forth in the relevant non-competition and non-solicitation agreement executed by the Company in connection with the disposition of our prior operations, there are no restrictions on the transactions that we can pursue, including with respect to industry sector and geographic location. During fiscal year 2019, the Board dissolved the Investment Committee and established an Asset Management Committee as a standing committee of the Board. The Asset Management Committee, among other things, continues the work of the former Investment Committee by providing oversight of the Company’s acquisition process and also manages the Company’s ongoing operations and assets (including continued expansion and development of its real estate operations) and those of any subsequently acquired businesses. 
Recent Events 
In December 2018, we entered into an arrangement with a leading MCA originator to participate in funding MCAs. We made an initial advance of $5.0 million to the originator (the “Initial MCA Advance”), who in turn advanced these funds to merchants as part of a syndication. MCAs are contracts formed through a future receivables or receipts purchase and sale agreement, which stipulates the purchase price, or the amount advanced, and the specified amount, or the advance amount plus the factored receivable balance the Company will be repaid, on the face of the contract. Generally, a specified amount will be withdrawn from the merchant’s bank account via daily or weekly ACH in order to pay down the merchant’s advance. These are not consumer loan contracts, nor are they installment loan contracts to businesses for business use only. In addition, there is no monthly minimum payment, nor is there a specific repayment schedule. As of December 31, 2018, our revenue and receivables from MCAs were derived from a single MCA originator with which we funded, in syndication, more than 100 advances to merchants. 
Pursuant to the LOI, the Company will acquire the interest in LuxeMark for a combination of up to $6 million in cash and equity, each payable over four years and subject to the achievement of prescribed financial performance milestones by LuxeMark. Additionally, the Company intends to fund up to $10 million in MCA capital, including through the Initial MCA Advance, which LuxeMark facilitated and for which LuxeMark provides certain servicing. The acquisition and deployment of any remaining MCA capital are subject to a number of conditions including the negotiation of definitive documentation and completion of CCUR’s due diligence investigation to CCUR’s satisfaction. 
We expect that the proposed transaction with LuxeMark will provide the Company with two revenue streams generated through (i) the Company’s 80% interest and thereby its pro-rated portion of the fee income earned by LuxeMark on its syndicators’ invested capital and (ii) returns received on funds the Company makes available as a LuxeMark syndicator or lender. 
Continued Pursuit of Acquisition Opportunities 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
Allowance for MCA credit losses 
The allowance for credit losses for MCAs is established at the time of purchase through a provision for losses charged to our statement of operations based on historical performance experienced by a peer group. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the future collection of principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. 
Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 
Interest Income on Commercial Loans. We created Recur Holdings LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019.

We generated $0.2 million of income from MCAs during the period and expect to fund additional MCAs in the remaining quarters of our fiscal year 2019.

Net realized gain on investments. During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019 we sold our investment position in certain debt and equity securities for which we recognized a $0.2 million realized gain for the six months ended December 31, 2018. 
Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes. We sold the Content Delivery business on December 31, 2017. Our income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for the six months ended December 31, 2017 includes the financial results of the Content Delivery business for that period, which is further described in Note 3, “Discontinued Operations,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 ·our future access to capital;  
 ·our exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives and development of new operating assets;  
 ·our ability to collect on our commercial loans and advances receivable;  
 ·the number of countries in which we operate, which may require maintenance of minimum cash levels in each country and, in certain cases, may restrict the repatriation of cash, by requiring us to maintain levels of capital;  
 ·our ongoing operating expenses; and  
 ·potential liquidation of the Company pursuant to an organized plan of liquidation.  
We used $0.1 million and $3.6 million of cash for operating activities during the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Operating cash usage during the six months ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to operating costs during the period exceeding cash generating income, as approximately $0.9 million of our income for the period was from non-cash accretion and payment-in-kind interest. Operating cash flows during the six months ending December 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to the timing of payments made against our accounts payable to settle the previous period’s transaction costs related to the sale of our Real-Time business in fiscal year 2017, inventory purchases and accrued compensation. 
Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
During the six months ended December 31, 2018, we funded $4.5 million of commercial loans, most of which were mortgage loans through our real estate operating subsidiary, Recur Holdings LLC. Our mortgage loans typically require interest only payments until maturity or payoff. We received $0.7 million of cash from principal payments during the six months ended December 31, 2018, as one mortgage loan was paid off during the period. We received approximately $1.2 million of cash for principal payment on a commercial revolving credit facility from the borrower who regularly draws from and pays principal on the revolving credit facility to support its working capital needs. 
In December 2018, we entered into an arrangement with a leading MCA originator to participate in funding its MCA originations. We made an initial advance of $5 million to the originator, who in turn advanced these funds to merchants as part of a syndication. As advances have been collected from the merchants, we have used the collected funds to fund additional MCAs. Through December 31, 2018, we have funded $5.9 million in MCAs and collected $0.9 million of merchant receivables as repayment for these advances. Additionally, we provided a $2 million cash advance to an aviation business to fund the deposit required for the recipient’s aircraft purchases for up to six months, in exchange for paying us an upfront fee. 
In the prior fiscal year six-month period, we paid two quarterly cash dividends, each for $0.12 per share, and $2.3 million in aggregate. On October 27, 2017, we announced the Board of Directors’ decision to suspend future dividends after the payment of the December 2017 quarterly dividend while the Board considers potential acquisition targets and alternative uses of our remaining assets. 
Liquidity 
We had working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $50.7 million at December 31, 2018, compared to working capital of $55.3 million at June 30, 2018. At December 31, 2018, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures. 
As of December 31, 2018, less than 1.0% of our cash was in foreign accounts and there is no expectation that any foreign cash would need to be transferred from these foreign accounts to cover U.S. operations in the next 12 months. Based upon our existing cash balances, equity securities and available-for-sale-term investments, historical cash usage, and anticipated operating cash flow in the current fiscal year, we believe that existing U.S. cash balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of this report. 
We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2018.
