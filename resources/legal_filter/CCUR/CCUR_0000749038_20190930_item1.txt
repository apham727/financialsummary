 1.Overview of the Business and Basis of Presentation 
Commercial and Mortgage Loans and Loan Losses 
We have the intent and ability to hold these loans to maturity or payoff and as such, have classified these loans as held-for-investment. These loans are reported on the balance sheet at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge-offs, allowance for loan losses, and deferred fees or costs. As of September 30, 2019, we have not recorded any charge-offs, and believe that an allowance for loan losses is not required. 
Land Investment 
Land investment assets are stated at acquired cost. Pre-acquisition and development costs are capitalized. Gains and losses resulting from the disposition of real estate are included in operations. As of September 30, 2019, all land held by the Company is considered to be held for use and development. 
Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share 
 ·Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
 ·Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and 
 ·Level 3 Assets or liabilities for which fair value is based on valuation models with significant unobservable pricing inputs and which include the use of management estimates. 
We used Level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of our preferred stock investments. The Company has elected the measurement alternative and will record the investments at cost adjusted for observable price changes for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Observable price changes and impairment indicators will be assessed each reporting period. 
We also use Level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of our contingent consideration and common stock purchase warrants related to the LuxeMark Acquisition. The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation technique to value the performance-based contingent consideration and common stock purchase warrants. This technique is a probabilistic model which relies on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The concluded values represent the means of those results. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”), on the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The new guidance changes the current accounting guidance related to the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities. We early adopted the new guidance effective June 30, 2019 as further disclosed in Note 13 to these financial statements. 
The recent accounting guidance not yet adopted is consistent with the information provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.

 4.Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans Receivable 
On July 1, 2019, a commercial mortgage loan in the amount of $1,400,000 defaulted. We do not believe the value of this loan is impaired, as the appraised value of the underlying property exceeds the outstanding balance of the mortgage. We are currently pursuing foreclosure and sale of this property to settle the outstanding debt. 
During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2019 we originated commercial loans in an aggregate principal amount of $2,750,000 to an MCA originator. During the first three months of our fiscal year 2020 we loaned an additional $2,750,000 to the same MCA originator with the same terms as the loans issued in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2019. These commercial loans have two-year terms and interest is charged at a rate of 17.0% per annum on the outstanding balances. 
As of September 30, 2019, 92% of merchant cash advances were originated through two MCA funders. 
During the three months ended September 30, 2019, we provided $3,000,000 of cash advances to an aviation business to fund the deposit required for the recipient’s aircraft purchases for up to one month, in exchange for paying us an upfront fee and a guaranty of the full repayment obligation from the principal of the third-party business. These prepaid fees are netted against the principal balance, earned over the one-month advance period, and are reported as part of MCA income within the statement of operations. Each quarter, we review the carrying value of this cash advance, and determine if an impairment reserve is necessary. 
 6.Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses 
As of June 30, 2019, we had state NOLs of $29,977,000 and foreign NOLs of $8,296,000. The state NOLs expire according to the rules of each state and expiration will occur between fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2037. The foreign NOLs expire according to the rules of each country. As of June 30, 2019, the foreign NOLs can be carried forward indefinitely in each country, although some countries do restrict the amount of NOL that can be used in a given tax year. 
Deferred Tax Assets and Related Valuation Allowances 
Unrecognized Tax Benefits 
We have a stock incentive plan providing for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and non-qualified stock options to employees and directors. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (“Compensation Committee”) administers the Amended and Restated 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. Under the plan, the Compensation Committee may award stock options and shares of common stock on a restricted basis. The plan also specifically provides for stock appreciation rights and authorizes the Compensation Committee to provide, either at the time of the grant of an option or otherwise, that the option may be cashed out upon terms and conditions to be determined by the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors. 
Our Amended and Restated 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Stock Plan”) became effective November 1, 2011 and replaced the 2001 Stock Option Plan that expired on October 31, 2011. At September 30, 2019, there were 787,219 shares available for future grants. 
We recorded $99,000 and $59,000 to general and administrative expense for stock-based compensation related to the issuance of stock options and restricted stock to employees and board members during the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
As of September 30, 2019, we had 167,500 service-condition restricted stock awards outstanding, of which none had vested, at a weighted-average grant date fair value of $4.15. 
Stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 resulted from vesting of shares over their respective vesting periods. Total remaining compensation cost of restricted stock awards issued but not yet vested as of September 30, 2019 is $369,000, which is expected to be recognized over the weighted average period of 2.3 years. 
Stock Options 
As of September 30, 2019, we had 15,000 stock options outstanding, of which 5,000 options had vested and were exercisable, at a weighted-average exercise price of $5.42, with a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 8.64 years. 
The total intrinsic value of options both outstanding and exercisable was nil for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Total remaining compensation cost of stock options granted, but not yet vested, at September 30, 2019 is $8,000, which is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years. We generally issue new shares to satisfy option exercises. During the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, there were no exercises of stock options. 
 11.Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
Operating lease cost is reported as part of general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. Sublease income is reported as a reduction of general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. Operating cash flows from leases are reported as part of net income on the consolidated statement of cash flows. Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities are reported as part of other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The short-term portions of the operating lease liabilities are reported as part of accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. The long-term portions of the operating lease liabilities are reported as part of other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. 
The total lease liability on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2019 is $499,000. Total unrecognized expected interest expense related to the lease is $49,000. 
 14.Commitments and Contingencies and Related Party Transactions 
Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other senior employees, employment may be terminated either by the respective employee or by the Company at any time. In the event an agreement is terminated by us without cause, or in certain circumstances terminates constructively or expires, the terminated employee will receive severance compensation for a period from six to 12 months, depending on the employee, and bonus severance. Additionally, if terminated, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and certain other senior executives will be entitled to Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“COBRA”) continuation coverage under the Company’s hospitalization and medical plan for the 12-month period following termination. At September 30, 2019, the maximum contingent liability under these agreements was $1,062,000. 
In February 2019, the Company entered into a management agreement (as amended, the “Management Agreement”) with CIDM LLC (“CIDM” or the “Asset Manager”) under which CIDM provides consulting services and advice to the Board of Directors and the Company’s management regarding asset allocation and acquisition strategy. CIDM exclusively manages the Company’s portfolio of publicly-traded investments and subject to the terms of the Management Agreement and the guidelines set forth therein, maintains investment authority over such portfolio, in order to better position the Company to increase its return on assets. CIDM is an affiliate of the Company’s largest stockholder, JDS1, LLC. Under the terms of the Management Agreement, in addition to a quarterly cash payment to compensate CIDM for expenses incurred in connection with providing these services, the Company pays for these services through the issuance of cash-settled stock appreciation rights (“SARs”). Based on the terms of the SARs and the Management Agreement, CIDM may not exercise the SARs unless there are certain qualifying changes of control of the Company (which does not include any change of control related to the stock ownership of CIDM or its affiliates). CIDM and its affiliates will be subject to standard trading restrictions and standstill provisions while the Management Agreement is active. Based upon the Company’s total assets as of September 30, 2019, we expect to issue an additional 87,997 SARs to CIDM during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2020. The contingent liability associated with this cash-settled SAR commitment is dependent on certain change-of-control events and is not limited.
