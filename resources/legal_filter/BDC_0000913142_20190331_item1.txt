Business Description



We are a signal transmission solutions provider built around two global business platforms – Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions.
Our comprehensive portfolio of signal transmission solutions provides industry leading secure and reliable transmission of data, sound, and video for mission critical applications.
Reporting Periods



Our fiscal year and fiscal fourth quarter both end on December 31.
Our fiscal first quarter ends on the Sunday falling closest to 91 days after December 31, which was March 31, 2019, the 90th day of our fiscal year 2019.
Our fiscal second and third quarters each have 91 days.
The three months ended April 1, 2018 included 91 days.
The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of the inputs as follows:



•Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;



•Level 2 – Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and



•Level 3 – Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
As of and during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, we utilized Level 1 inputs to determine the fair value of cash equivalents, and we utilized Level 2 and Level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations (see Note 3).
We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018.
Cash and Cash Equivalents



We classify cash on hand and deposits in banks, including commercial paper, money market accounts, and other investments with an original maturity of three months or less, that we hold from time to time, as cash and cash equivalents.
We periodically have cash equivalents consisting of short-term money market funds and other investments.
As of March 31, 2019, we did not have any such cash equivalents on hand.
The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations.
- 5-



Contingent Liabilities



We have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies that are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable, the amounts of which are currently not material.
We accrue environmental remediation costs based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposures developed in consultation with our environmental consultants and legal counsel.
We are, from time to time, subject to routine litigation incidental to our business.
As of March 31, 2019, we were party to standby letters of credit, bank guaranties, and surety bonds totaling $7.3 million, $3.6 million, and $3.3 million, respectively.
Revenue Recognition



We recognize revenue consistent with the principles as outlined in the following five step model: (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.
See Note 2.
See Note 16.
Current-Year Adoption of Accounting Pronouncements



In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-02, Leases ("ASU 2016-02"), a leasing standard for both lessees and lessors that supersedes the lease requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 840, "Leases."
Under its core principle, a lessee will recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for nearly all leased assets, and additional disclosures are required to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
Lessor accounting remains largely consistent with existing U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 using the newly permitted transition method issued in July 2018, under ASU No.
2018-11 (“ASU 2018-11”), Leases: Targeted Improvements, which provides an additional (and optional) transition method for adopting the new lease standard.
Furthermore, we elected the following practical expedients and accounting policy elections upon adoption: (i) the package of practical expedients as defined in ASU 2016-02, (ii) the short-term lease accounting policy election, (iii) the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components, and (iv) the easement practical expedient, which permits an entity to continue applying its current policy for accounting for land easements that existed as of the effective date of ASU 2016-02.
The adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets of approximately $90.5 million and lease liabilities for operating leases of approximately$103.4 million on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, with no material impact to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations or Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.
The difference between the initial lease liabilities and the ROU assets is related primarily to previously existing lease liabilities.
See Note 7 for further information regarding the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company's financial statements.
In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities ("ASU 2017-12").
The new guidance also makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance and ease the administrative burden of hedge documentation requirements and assessing hedge effectiveness.
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
We adopted ASU 2017-12 effective January 1, 2019.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
The new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
- 6-



In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
2018-07 (“ASU 2018-07”), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
The amendments in ASU 2018-07 expand the scope of Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees, and provide that non-employee share-based payment awards be measured at their grant-date fair value and the probability of satisfying performance conditions be taken into account when non-employee share-based payment awards contain such conditions.
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
We adopted ASU 2018-07 effective January 1, 2019.
In August 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) adopted the final rule under SEC Release No.
33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification, amending certain disclosure requirements that were redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated or superseded.
Additionally, the amendments expanded the disclosure requirements on the analysis of stockholders' equity for interim financial statements.
Under the amendments, an analysis of changes in each caption of stockholders' equity presented in the balance sheet must be provided in a note or separate statement.
The analysis should present a reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance of each period presented.
This final rule was effective on November 5, 2018.
We implemented SEC Release No.
Pending Adoption of Recent Accounting Pronouncements



In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-13 (“ASU 2016-13”), Financial Instruments - Credit Losses.
The new standard will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2020.
Early adoption is permitted.
The following tables present our revenues disaggregated by major product category.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The following tables present our revenues disaggregated by geography, based on the location of the customer purchasing the product.
- 7-



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The following tables present our revenues disaggregated by products, including software products, and support and services.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We generate revenues primarily by selling products that provide secure and reliable transmission of data, sound, and video for mission critical applications.
We also generate revenues from providing support and professional services.
We sell our products to distributors, end-users, installers, and directly to original equipment manufacturers.
At times, we enter into arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple performance obligations.
For these arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative selling price and recognized when or as each performance obligation is satisfied.
Most of our performance obligations related to the sale of products are satisfied at a point in time when control of the product is transferred based on the shipping terms of the arrangement.
Generally, we determine relative selling price using the prices charged to customers on a standalone basis.
Adjustments to revenue for performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was not significant during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Accrued rebates and accrued returns as of March 31, 2019 totaled $17.7 million and $11.7 million, respectively.
Estimated price adjustments recognized against our gross accounts receivable balance as of March 31, 2019 totaled $25.8 million.
Depending on the terms of an arrangement, we may defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received because we have to satisfy a future obligation.
Consideration allocated to support services under a support and maintenance contract is typically paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the service.
Consideration allocated to professional services is recognized when or as the services are performed depending on the terms of the arrangement.
As of January 1, 2019, total deferred revenue was $113.3 million, and during the three months ended March 31, 2019, $47.8 million of revenue was deferred, `and $53.3 million of revenue was recognized.
As of March 31, 2019, total deferred revenue was $107.8 million, and of this amount, $92.5 million will be recognized within the next twelve months, and the remaining $15.3 million is long-term and will be recognized over a period greater than twelve months.
Total capitalized sales commissions was $3.4 million as of March 31, 2019.
Total sales commissions costs were $5.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Sales commissions are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.

Note 3: Acquisitions



Net-Tech Technology, Inc.



We acquired 100% of the shares of Net-Tech Technology, Inc. (NT2) on April 25, 2018 for a purchase price of $8.5 million that was funded with cash on hand.
NT2 is an integrator of optical passive components and network optimization products used within broadband network applications where optical backhaul is used.
NT2 is located in the United States.
Snell Advanced Media



We acquired 100% of the outstanding ownership interest in Snell Advanced Media (SAM) on February 8, 2018 for a purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $104.5 million.
Of the $104.5 million purchase price, $75.2 million was paid on February 8, 2018 and was funded with cash on hand.
The acquisition included a potential earnout, which is based upon future combined earnings of SAM and Grass Valley through December 31, 2019.
The maximum earnout consideration is $31.4 million, but based upon a third party valuation specialist using certain assumptions in a discounted cash flow model, the estimated fair value of the earnout included in the purchase price was $29.3 million.
We assumed debt of $19.3 million and paid it off during the first quarter of 2018.
During the first quarter of 2019, we signed a settlement agreement with the sellers of SAM for claims arising over the timing of the earnout consideration outlined in the purchase agreement, and as part of the settlement, the parties agreed that the maximum earnout consideration of $31.4 million would be payable during the first quarter 2020, unless earlier payment is required as per the terms of the purchase agreement.
SAM designs, manufactures, and sells innovative content production and distribution systems for the broadcast and media markets.
SAM is located in the United Kingdom.
The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as of February 8, 2018 (in thousands):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



During the first quarter 2019, we did not record any significant measurement-period adjustments.
The fair value of acquired receivables is $16.6 million, which is equivalent to its gross contractual amount.
For purposes of the above allocation, we based our estimate of the fair values for the acquired inventory; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and deferred revenue on valuation studies performed by a third party valuation firm.
To determine the value of the acquired property, plant, and equipment, we used various valuation methods, including both the market approach, which considers sales prices of similar assets in similar conditions (Level 2 valuation), and the cost approach, which considers the cost to replace the asset adjusted for depreciation (Level 3 valuation).
We used various valuation methods including discounted cash flows, lost income, excess earnings, and relief from royalty to estimate the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets and deferred revenue (Level 3 valuation).
Goodwill and other intangible assets reflected above were determined to meet the criteria for recognition apart from tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies and the assembled workforce.
The expected synergies for the SAM acquisition may be gained from helping broadcast and media content creators, aggregators and distributors significantly improve their effectiveness and efficiency during a period of rapid change in technology, viewer and advertiser behavior and business models.
The intangible assets related to the acquisition consisted of the following:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The amortizable intangible assets reflected in the table above were determined by us to have finite lives.
The useful life for the customer relationship intangible asset was based on our forecasts of estimated sales from recurring customers.
The useful life of the backlog intangible asset was based on our estimate of when the ordered items would ship.
The useful life for the trademarks was based on the period of time we expect to continue to go to market using the trademarks.
Our consolidated revenues and consolidated income before taxes for the three months ended April 1, 2018 included $20.8 million and $(2.8) million, respectively, from SAM.
The loss before taxes from SAM included $2.2 million of amortization of intangible assets and $0.5 million of cost of sales related to the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value.
- 10-



The following table illustrates the unaudited pro forma effect on operating results as if the SAM acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2017.
Pro forma adjustments exclude cost savings from any synergies resulting from the acquisition.
Note 4: Reportable Segments



We are organized around two global business platforms: Enterprise Solutions and Industrial Solutions.
Each of the global business platforms represents a reportable segment.
The key measures of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker are Segment Revenues and Segment EBITDA.
Segment EBITDA excludes certain items, including depreciation expense; amortization of intangibles; asset impairment; severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; purchase accounting effects related to acquisitions, such as the adjustment of acquired inventory and deferred revenue to fair value; and other costs.
We allocate corporate expenses to the segments for purposes of measuring Segment EBITDA.
Corporate expenses are allocated on the basis of each segment’s relative EBITDA prior to the allocation.
Our measure of segment assets does not include cash, goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets, or corporate assets.
All goodwill is allocated to reporting units of our segments for purposes of impairment testing.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 - 12-



(1) Our segment results include revenues that would have been recorded by acquired businesses had they remained as independent entities.
See Note 3, Acquisitions, for details.
(2) See Note 9, Severance, Restructuring, and Acquisition Integration Activities, for details.
(3) For the three months ended March 31, 2019, we recognized $1.3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses related to the earnout consideration for the SAM acquisition.
For the three months ended April 1, 2018, we recognized cost of sales for the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value related to the SAM acquisition.
Note 5: Income per Share



The following table presents the basis for the income per share computations:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include outstanding equity awards of 1.0 million and 0.5 million, respectively, because to do so would have been anti-dilutive.
In addition, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include outstanding equity awards of 0.3 million and 0.2 million, respectively, because the related performance conditions have not been satisfied.
Furthermore, for both the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, diluted weighted average shares outstanding do not include the impact of preferred shares that are convertible into 6.9 million common shares, because deducting the preferred stock dividends from net income was more dilutive.
For purposes of calculating basic earnings per share, unvested restricted stock units are not included in the calculation of basic weighted average shares outstanding until all necessary conditions have been satisfied and issuance of the shares underlying the restricted stock units is no longer contingent.
Necessary conditions are not satisfied until the vesting date, at which time holders of our restricted stock units receive shares of our common stock.
For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, unvested restricted stock units are included to the extent that they are dilutive.
In determining whether unvested restricted stock units are dilutive, each issuance of restricted stock units is considered separately.
Once a restricted stock unit has vested, it is included in the calculation of both basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding.

Note 6: Inventories



The major classes of inventories were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Note 7: Leases



We have operating and finance leases for properties, including manufacturing facilities, warehouses, and office space; as well as vehicles and certain equipment.
We make certain judgments in determining whether a contract contains a lease in accordance with ASU 2016-02.
Our leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to 16 years, some of which include options to extend the lease for a period of up to 15 years and some include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.
We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably certain as of the commencement date of the lease.
We have entered into various short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less.
These leases are not recorded on our balance sheet, and for the three months ended March 31, 2019, the rent expense for short-term leases was not material.
We have certain property and equipment lease contracts that may contain lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for these components together as a single combined lease component.
As the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, we use the incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments, which is unique to each leased asset, and is based upon the term of the lease, commencement date of the lease, local currency of the leased asset, and the credit rating of the legal entity leasing the asset.
The components of lease expense were as follows:

Note 8: Long-Lived Assets



Depreciation and Amortization Expense



We recognized depreciation expense of $12.7 million and $11.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, respectively.
We recognized amortization expense related to our intangible assets of $24.3 million and $24.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, respectively.
Note 9: Severance, Restructuring, and Acquisition Integration Activities



Grass Valley and SAM Integration Program: 2018 - 2019



In 2018, we began a restructuring program to integrate SAM with Grass Valley.
The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions.
We recognized $3.0 million and $9.2 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, respectively.
The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment.
We do not expect to incur any more costs for this program.
Industrial Manufacturing Footprint Program: 2016 - 2018



In 2016, we began a program to consolidate our manufacturing footprint.
The manufacturing consolidation was complete as of December 31, 2018.
We recognized $7.5 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three months ended April 1, 2018.
The following table summarizes the costs by segment of the various programs described above as well as other immaterial programs and acquisition integration activities:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Of the total severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2019, $0.6 million, $2.8 million, and $0.4 million were included in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses; and research and development expenses, respectively.
The majority of the other restructuring and integration costs related to these actions were paid as incurred or are payable within the next 60 days.
There were no significant severance accrual balances as of March 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.
- 16-



Note 10: Long-Term Debt and Other Borrowing Arrangements



The carrying values of our long-term debt were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

- 17-



Fair Value of Long-Term Debt



The fair value of our senior subordinated notes as of March 31, 2019 was approximately $1,486.7 million based on quoted prices of the debt instruments in inactive markets (Level 2 valuation).
This amount represents the fair value of our senior subordinated notes with a carrying value of $1,462.5 million as of March 31, 2019.
Note 11: Net Investment Hedge



All of our euro denominated notes were issued by Belden Inc., a USD functional currency entity.
As of March 31, 2019, all of our outstanding foreign denominated debt is designated as a net investment hedge on the foreign currency risk of our net investment in our euro foreign operations.
The objective of the hedge is to protect the net investment in the foreign operation against adverse changes in the euro exchange rate.
The transaction gain or loss is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income.
The amount of the cumulative translation adjustment associated with these notes for the three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018 was a gain of $23.6 million and a loss of $39.2 million, respectively.

Also on December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (“SAB 118”) was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act.
During the three months ended April 1, 2018, we obtained additional information affecting the provisional amount initially recorded for the valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credits in 2017, and as a result, recorded an adjustment to the valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credits at such time.

Note 15: Preferred Stock



In 2016, we issued 5.2 million depositary shares, each of which represents 1/100th interest in a share of 6.75% Series B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock), for an offering price of $100 per depositary share.
Holders of the Preferred Stock may elect to convert their shares into common stock at any time prior to the mandatory conversion date.
Unless earlier converted, each share of Preferred Stock will automatically convert into common stock on or around July 15, 2019 into between 120.46 and 132.50 shares of Belden common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.
This represents a range of 6.2 million to 6.9 million shares of Belden common stock to be issued upon conversion.
The number of shares of Belden common stock issuable upon the mandatory conversion of the Preferred Stock will be determined based upon the volume-weighted average price of Belden’s common stock over the 20 day trading period beginning on, and including, the 22nd scheduled trading day prior to July 15, 2019.
The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $501 million.
The net proceeds are for general corporate purposes.
With respect to dividend and liquidation rights, the Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock and junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness.
During each of the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2018, dividends on the Preferred Stock were $8.7 million.
Note 16: Subsequent Events



We acquired 100% of the shares of Opterna International Corp. (Opterna) on April 15, 2019 for a purchase price of approximately $45 million, net of cash acquired.
The acquisition also includes potential earnout consideration up to a maximum of $25 million.

We believe our business system, balance across markets and geographies, systematic go-to-market approach, extensive portfolio of innovative solutions, commitment to Lean principles, and improving margins present a unique value proposition for shareholders.
We consider revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flows, and return on invested capital to be our key operating performance indicators.
We also seek to acquire businesses that we believe can help us achieve these objectives.
Foreign currency



Our exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relates to exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the euro, Canadian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, British pound, Indian rupee, and Brazilian real.
During the three months ended March 31, 2019, approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues were to customers outside of the U.S.
Therefore, all references to the effect of copper prices or other commodity prices are estimates.
As such, all references to the effect of channel inventory changes are estimates.
Our strategic goal is to utilize our Market Delivery System to target faster growing geographies, applications, and trends within our end markets, in order to achieve growth that is higher than the general market growth rate.
To the extent that we exceed the market growth rates, we consider it to be the result of capturing market share.
Grass Valley and SAM Integration Program



In 2018, we began a restructuring program to integrate SAM with Grass Valley.
The restructuring and integration activities are focused on achieving desired cost savings by consolidating existing and acquired facilities and other support functions.
We recognized $3.0 million of severance and other restructuring costs for this program during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
The costs were incurred by the Enterprise Solutions segment.
We do not expect to incur any more costs for this program.
Results of Operations



Consolidated Income before Taxes 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Revenues decreased $18.4 million, or 3.0%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018 due to the following factors:



•Lower sales volume resulted in a $20.9 million decrease in revenues.
•Currency translation had a $13.7 million unfavorable impact on revenues.
•Copper prices had a $5.1 million unfavorable impact on revenues.
•Favorable pricing resulted in a $10.6 million increase in revenues.
•Acquisitions contributed an estimated $10.7 million increase in revenues.
- 22-



The decrease in volume was primarily experienced in our Enterprise solutions segment, partially offset by an increase in volume in our Industrial solutions segment.
Gross profit decreased $5.9 million, or 2.5%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018 due to the decreases in revenues discussed above as well as a $0.7 million increase in the amortization of software development intangible assets.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 1.7%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018.
A decrease in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; favorable currency translation; and productivity improvement initiatives contributed $6.6 million, $1.7 million, and $0.9 million, respectively, to the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses; partially offset by a $5.8 million and $1.3 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses from acquisitions and purchase accounting effects related to acquisitions, respectively, over the year ago period.
Research and development expenses decreased $2.9 million, or 7.9%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018.
Productivity improvement initiatives; a decrease in severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; and favorable currency translation contributed $2.6 million, $1.2 million, and $0.4 million, respectively, to the decrease in research and development expenses; partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in research and development expenses from acquisitions over the year ago period.
Amortization of intangibles decreased $1.1 million, or 4.4%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018 primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.
Operating income increased $0.2 million, or 0.5%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018 primarily due to the decrease in operating expenses discussed above.
Net interest expense decreased $2.8 million, or 16.4%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018 as a result of our debt transactions during 2018.
In March 2018, we issued €350.0 million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due 2028 at an interest rate of 3.875%, and used the net proceeds of this offering and cash on hand to repurchase all of our outstanding €200.0 million 5.5% senior subordinated notes due 2023 as well as all of our outstanding $200.0 million 5.25% senior subordinated notes due 2024.
The loss on debt extinguishment recognized in the first quarter of 2018 represents the premium paid to the bond holders to retire a portion of the 2023 and 2024 notes and the unamortized debt issuance costs written-off.
Income before taxes increased $23.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018.
This increase is primarily due to the loss on debt extinguishment in the prior year as well as the decline in net interest expense and increase in operating income over the year ago period discussed above.
Income Taxes



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We recognized income tax expense of $5.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, representing an effective tax rate of 18.3%.
- 23-



We recognized income tax expense of $4.4 million for the three months ended April 1, 2018 representing an effective tax rate of 63.2%.
The effective tax rate was impacted by the following significant factors:



•We recognized income tax expense of $1.8 million in the three months ended April 1, 2018 as a result of a change in our valuation allowance on foreign tax credits associated with our euro debt refinancing during the quarter.
On December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law, making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.
During the three months ended April 1, 2018, we obtained additional information affecting the provisional amount initially recorded for the valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credits in 2017, and as a result, recorded an adjustment to the valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credits at such time.
Consolidated Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Adjusted Revenues decreased $20.2 million, or 3.3%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018 due to the following factors:

•Copper prices had a $5.1 million unfavorable impact on revenues.
•Acquisitions contributed an estimated $8.9 million increase in revenues.

Adjusted EBITDA decreased in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018 primarily due to the decrease in revenues as discussed above.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information



Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures.
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we provide non-GAAP operating results adjusted for certain items, including: asset impairments; accelerated depreciation expense due to plant consolidation activities; purchase accounting effects related to acquisitions, such as the adjustment of acquired inventory and deferred revenue to fair value, and transaction costs; severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs; gains (losses) recognized on the disposal of businesses and tangible assets; amortization of intangible assets; gains (losses) on debt extinguishment; certain revenues and gains (losses) from patent settlements; discontinued operations; and other costs.
We adjust for the items listed above in all periods presented, unless the impact is clearly immaterial to our financial statements.
As an example, we adjust for the purchase accounting effect of recording deferred revenue at fair value in order to reflect the revenues that would have otherwise been recorded by acquired businesses had they remained as independent entities.
We believe this presentation is useful in evaluating the underlying performance of acquired companies.
We believe the adjusted measures, accompanied by the disclosure of the costs of these programs, provides valuable insight.
Adjusted results should be considered only in conjunction with results reported according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
See Note 3, Acquisitions, for details.
(2) See Note 9, Severance, Restructuring, and Acquisition Integration Activities, for details.
(3) For the three months ended March 31, 2019, we recognized $1.3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses related to the earnout consideration for the SAM acquisition.
For the three months ended April 1, 2018, we recognized cost of sales for the adjustment of acquired inventory to fair value related to the SAM acquisition.

Enterprise Solutions EBITDA decreased $17.9 million, or 31.1%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the year ago period primarily as a result of the decline in revenues discussed above, partially offset by the impact of productivity improvement initiatives, which had an estimated $5.8 million favorable impact on EBITDA.
Industrial Solutions 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Industrial Solutions revenues increased $4.2 million, or 1.6%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018 primarily due to growth in volume and favorable pricing, which contributed an estimated $11.1 million and $4.3 million to the increase in revenues, respectively; partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and lower copper prices, which had an estimated $8.2 million and $3.0 million unfavorable impact on revenues, respectively.
The increase in volume was broad-based with growth in all regions.
Industrial Solutions EBITDA increased $1.0 million, or 2.2%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from the comparable period of 2018 primarily as a result of the growth in revenues discussed above.
Accordingly, EBITDA margins expanded 10 basis points year-over-year.
Liquidity and Capital Resources



Significant factors affecting our cash liquidity include (1) cash from operating activities, (2) disposals of businesses and tangible assets, (3) cash used for acquisitions, restructuring actions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, and senior subordinated note repurchases, (4) our available credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements, and (5) cash proceeds from equity offerings.
We expect our operating activities to generate cash in 2019 and believe our sources of liquidity are sufficient to fund current working capital requirements, capital expenditures, contributions to our retirement plans, share repurchases, senior subordinated note repurchases, quarterly dividend payments, and our short-term operating strategies.
