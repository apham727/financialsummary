Overview 



TransAct Technologies Incorporated ("TransAct") is a global leader in developing and selling software-driven technology and printing solutions for high growth markets including restaurant solutions, point of sale ("POS") automation and banking, casino and gaming, lottery, mobile and oil and gas.
Our world-class products are designed from the ground up based on market and customer requirements and are sold under the AccuDate™, Epic, EPICENTRAL™, Ithaca®, Printrex® and Responder® brand names.
Known and respected worldwide for innovative designs and real-world service reliability, our thermal and inkjet printers and terminals generate top-quality labels and transaction records such as receipts, tickets, coupons, register journals and other documents, as well as printed logging and plotting of data.
We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), value-added resellers ("VARs"), select distributors, as well as directly to end-users.
Our product distribution spans across the Americas, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean Islands and the South Pacific.
TransAct also provides world-class service, spare parts, accessories and printing supplies to its growing worldwide installed base of products.
Through our TransAct Services Group ("TSG"), we provide a complete range of supplies and consumables used in the printing and scanning activities of customers in the restaurant and hospitality, banking, retail, casino and gaming, government and oil and gas exploration markets.
Through our webstore, www.transactsupplies.com, and our direct selling team, we address the demand for these products.
We operate in one reportable segment, the design, development, and marketing of software-driven technology and printing solutions for high growth markets, and provide related services, supplies and spare parts.

Results of Operations: Three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to three months ended March 31, 2017 



Net Sales.
Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales, as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 *  International sales do not include sales of printers and terminals made to domestic distributors or other domestic customers who may in turn ship those printers and terminals to international destinations.
Net sales for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $1.8 million, or 13%, from the same period in 2017.
Printer and terminal sales volume decreased 28% to approximately 31 thousand units driven primarily by an 80% decrease in unit volume from the lottery market and a 29% decrease in unit volume in the POS automation and banking market.
These decreases were partially offset by increases in unit volume of 6% from the casino and gaming market and 87% from the restaurant solutions market.
The average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 15% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.  



International sales for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $1.4 million, or 41%, from the same period in 2017 primarily due to a decrease in sales in the international lottery market and to a lesser extent a 14% decrease in the international casino and gaming market.
Restaurant Solutions: 



Revenue from the restaurant solutions market includes sales of terminals that combine hardware and software in a device that includes an operating system, touchscreen and one or two thermal print mechanisms that print easy-to-read food rotation labels, grab and go labels for prepared foods, and "enjoy by" date labels to help food service establishments and restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick-serve convenience and hospitality establishments) effectively manage food safety and automate and manage back-of-the-restaurant operations.
We expect sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 as we benefit from the strategic selling and marketing investments implemented during 2017.
POS automation and banking: 



Revenue from the POS automation and banking market includes sales of thermal and impact printers used primarily by restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick serve and hospitality establishments) located either at the checkout counter or within self-service kiosks to print receipts for consumers or print on linerless labels.
In addition, revenue includes sales of inkjet printers used by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to print deposit or withdrawal receipts and/or validate checks at bank teller stations.
A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic POS automation and banking product revenue in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by a 27% decrease in domestic sales of our Ithaca® 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald's slowed compared to the record pace experienced in 2016 and the first quarter of 2017.
We expect sales to McDonald's to decrease for the full year 2018 compared to the full year 2017, as McDonald's completes the implementation of initiatives that use the Ithaca 9000, which began in 2015.
13 



Casino and gaming: 



Revenue from the casino and gaming market includes sales of thermal ticket printers used in slot machines, video lottery terminals ("VLTs"), and other gaming machines that print tickets or receipts instead of issuing coins ("ticket-in, ticket-out" or "TITO") at casinos and racetracks and other gaming venues worldwide.
Revenue from this market also includes sales of thermal roll-fed printers used in the international off-premise gaming market in gaming machines such as Amusement with Prizes, Skills with Prizes and Fixed Odds Betting Terminals at non-casino gaming establishments.
Revenue from this market also includes royalties related to our patented casino and gaming technology.
In addition, casino and gaming market revenue includes sales of the EPICENTRAL™ print system, our software solution (including annual software maintenance), that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them real-time at the slot machine.
A summary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products was due largely to a 19% increase in domestic sales of our thermal casino printers in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, driven primarily by increased sales to our OEMs.
Additionally, domestic EPICENTRAL™ software sales increased 233% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 as we completed one new installation in 2018 compared to no installations completed during the first quarter of 2017.
International casino and gaming product sales decreased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to a 32% decline in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to Europe, Australia and Asia.
Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
International sales of our thermal casino printers increased 5% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.
We expect international sales of both our thermal casino printers and off-premise gaming printers to increase in 2018 as we benefit from the transition away from our previous exclusive worldwide distributor whose contract ended at the end of 2017 and begin to sell directly to our slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe.
Lottery: 



Revenue from the lottery market includes sales of thermal on-line and other lottery printers primarily to International Game Technology and its subsidiaries ("IGT"), and to a lesser extent, other lottery system companies for various lottery applications.
The decrease in international lottery sales in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 was due to a sale of lottery printers to IGT for the Canadian lottery in the first quarter of 2017 and no comparable sale occurring in the first quarter of 2018.
Printrex: 



Printrex branded printers are sold into markets that include wide format, desktop and rack mounted and vehicle mounted black/white thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field, seismic and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry.
It also includes high-speed color inkjet desktop printers used to print logs at the data centers of the oil and gas field service companies.
Revenue in this market also includes sales of vehicle mounted printers used to print schematics and certain other critical information in emergency services vehicles and other mobile printing applications.
A summary of sales of our worldwide Printrex printers for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in sales of Printrex printers in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 resulted from 107% higher domestic sales in the oil and gas market.
14 



TSG: 



Revenue from TSG includes sales of consumable products (inkjet cartridges, ribbons, receipt paper, color thermal paper, food safety labels and other printing supplies), replacement parts, maintenance and repair services, testing services, refurbished printers, and shipping and handling charges.
A summary of sales in our worldwide TSG market for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The decrease in domestic revenue from TSG for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the prior year period was due to decreased replacement part sales, service revenue and non-Printrex consumable product sales of 7%, 11% and 6%, respectively.
These decreases were partially offset by a 34% increase in Printrex consumables related to the recovery in the oil and gas market.
Internationally, revenue from TSG increased slightly in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to higher international replacement part sales.
Gross Profit.
Although gross profit decreased, our gross margin increased 440 basis points, from 47.9% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 43.5% in the first quarter of 2017.
Engineering, design and product development information for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Engineering, design and product development expenses primarily include salary and payroll related expenses for our hardware and software engineering staff, depreciation and design expenses (including prototype printer expenses, outside design and testing services, and supplies).
Such expenses increased $228 thousand, or 23%, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due primarily to the hiring of additional engineering staff and increased expenses related to product development for the restaurant solutions and casino and gaming markets.
We expect engineering, design and product development expenses to be higher in 2018 compared to 2017, as we continue to expand our engineering staff to support new product development for the restaurant solutions market.
15 



Operating Expenses - Selling and Marketing.
Such expenses decreased by $99 thousand, or 6%, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to the retirement of our EVP, Sales and Marketing in December 2017, whose position was replaced by an existing employee of TransAct, as well as the elimination of commission expense to our former international casino and gaming distributor, Suzo-Happ.
We expect selling and marketing expenses to be higher in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the build-out of our internal sales infrastructure to sell directly to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe in 2018.
Operating Expenses - General and Administrative.
General and administrative information for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



General and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resource and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company.
General and administrative expenses increased $200 thousand, or 10%, in first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due primarily to higher severance and incentive compensation expense incurred in the 2018 period.
We expect general and administrative expenses in 2018 to be higher than 2017 due to increased recruiting expenses as we continue to expand our restaurant solutions sales and engineering staff and complete the planned expansion of sales staff for our European casino and gaming market.
Operating Income.
Operating income information for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Our operating income decreased $560 thousand, or 40%, and our operating margin decreased to 7% of net sales in the first quarter of 2018 from 10% of net sales in the first quarter of 2017.
Interest.
We recorded net interest expense of $8 thousand in the first quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2017.
We do not expect significant changes in net interest expense for the full year 2018.
Other, net.
We recorded other income of $10 thousand in the first quarter of 2018 compared to other expense of $6 thousand in the first quarter of 2017.
The change was due to foreign currency transaction exchange gains recorded in 2018 compared to foreign currency transaction losses recorded in the 2017 period.
The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was lower than the effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2017 due to the passage of the Tax Reform Act that was signed on December 22, 2017.
We expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21% for the full year 2018.
16 



Net Income.
We reported net income for the first quarter of 2018 of $680 thousand, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to $943 thousand, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.
Impact of Inflation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources 



Cash Flow 



In the first three months of 2018, our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $838 thousand, or 15%, from December 31, 2017 and we ended the first quarter of 2018 with $4.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $315 thousand was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding.
Operating activities: The following significant factors affected our cash provided by operating activities of $1.9 million in the first three months of 2018 as compared to $771 thousand in the first three months of 2017: 



During the first three months of 2018: 



  ●  We reported net income of $680 thousand.
●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $221 thousand, and share-based compensation expense of $161 thousand.
●  Accounts receivable decreased $2.3 million, or 21%, due to the collection of past due receivables for 2017 sales made to our former international casino and gaming distributor.
●  Prepaid income taxes decreased $161 thousand during the first quarter of 2018.
●  Accounts payable decreased $740 thousand, or 19%, due primarily to higher inventory purchases made towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2018 that were subsequently paid in the first quarter of 2018.
●  Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $872 thousand, or 21%, due primarily to the payment of 2017 annual bonuses in March 2018.

  ●  We reported net income of $943 thousand.
●  We recorded depreciation and amortization of $313 thousand, and share-based compensation expense of $146 thousand.
●  Accounts receivable decreased $1.3 million, or 12%, due to the collection of receivables for sales made late in the fourth quarter of 2016.
●  Inventories increased $254 thousand, or 3%, due largely to the purchase of AccuDate inventory to support expected restaurant solutions sales in 2017.
●  Other current assets and long-term assets increased $169 thousand, or 45%, due largely to advance payments made in the first quarter of 2017 for annual ERP software maintenance expense.

Investing activities: Our capital expenditures were $298 thousand and $234 thousand in the first three months of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Expenditures in 2018 were primarily for computer and networking equipment and furniture and fixtures purchases related to investments made in our U.K. facility to support the build-out of our internal sales infrastructure to sell directly to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers.
To a lesser extent, expenditures in 2018 included computer and networking equipment for our U.S. operations.
Expenditures in the first three months of 2017 were primarily for new product tooling equipment and computer and networking equipment and, to a lesser extent, leasehold improvements for our Ithaca facility.
Financing activities: We used $2.4 million of cash from financing activities during the first three months of 2018 to purchase $1.6 million of common stock for treasury, to pay dividends of $673 thousand to common shareholders and $246 thousand related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $94 thousand.
During the first three months of 2017, we used $605 thousand of cash from financing activities to pay dividends of $587 thousand to common shareholders and $18 thousand related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan.

Credit Facility and Borrowings 



We maintain a credit facility (the "TD Bank Credit Facility") with TD Bank N.A., which provides for a $20 million revolving credit line.
On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022.
Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all of our assets.
We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line.
The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12.5 million from $10 million.
The TD Bank Credit Facility imposes certain quarterly financial covenants on us and restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the creation of other liens.
We were in compliance with all financial covenants of the TD Bank Credit Facility at March 31, 2018.
The following table lists the financial covenants and the performance measurements at March 31, 2018: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of March 31, 2018, borrowings available under the TD Bank Credit facility were $20 million.
Shareholder Dividend Payments 



In September 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program, with an initial quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share, subject to the Board's approval each quarter.
Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017.
Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $673 thousand, or $0.09 per share, and $587 thousand, or $0.08 per share, in the first quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2017, respectively.
Stock Repurchase Program 



On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the "2018 Stock Repurchase Program").
The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue it prior to such time.
We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account.
Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date.
Resource Sufficiency 



We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our expected cash flows generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our TD Bank Credit Facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and dividend payments and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months.
Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 



The disclosure of payments we have committed to make under our contractual obligations is set forth under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2017.
We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
