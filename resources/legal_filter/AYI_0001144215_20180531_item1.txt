4.New Accounting Pronouncements



Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2018



In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, (“ASU 2016-09”), which changes certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 effective as of September 1, 2017.
As such, cash flows from operations for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 increased $18.7 million, with a corresponding decrease to cash flows from financing activities, compared to amounts previously reported.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
The Company adopted ASU 2018-02 effective as of the beginning of the current reporting period and recorded a reclassification for the stranded tax effects resulting from the TCJA from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Retained earnings in the amount of $11.1 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
Accounting Standards Yet to Be Adopted



In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-07, Compensation — Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”), which will change the presentation of net periodic benefit cost related to employer sponsored defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits.
Additionally, only service costs may be capitalized in assets.
ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2017.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business (“ASU 2017-01”), which requires an evaluation of whether substantially all of the fair value of assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets.
If so, the transaction does not qualify as a business.
The guidance also requires an acquired business to include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs.
ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2017.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2017-01 and intends to implement the standard as required in fiscal 2019.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (“ASU 2016-15”), which is intended to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows including debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance.
ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2017.
The Company intends to implement the standard as required in fiscal 2019, and the provisions of ASU 2016-15 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statement disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”), which requires lessees to include most leases on the balance sheet.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2018.
In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842, which establishes an optional transition practical expedient when applying the guidance in ASU 2016-02 and has the same effective date as the original standard.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2016-02 and intends to implement the standard as required in fiscal 2020.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”), which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP.
Since the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB released several amendments to improve and clarify the implementation guidance, as well as to change the effective date.
These standards have been collectively codified within Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”).
ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
ASC 606 permits two transition methods: the full retrospective method and the modified retrospective method.
Under the full retrospective method, the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented with the cumulative effect of applying the standard recognized at the earliest period shown.
Under the modified retrospective method, the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application.
ASC 606 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
The Company will adopt the requirements of the new standard on September 1, 2018.
The Company has an implementation team tasked with identifying potential differences that will result from applying the new revenue recognition standard to the Company's contracts with its customers.
The implementation team reports the findings and progress of the project to management on a frequent basis and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.
The implementation team has completed its initial phase of contract reviews and continues to evaluate the results of those reviews with respect to potential changes from adopting the new standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, the implementation team is in the process of identifying appropriate changes to the Company's business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard.
Based on the implementation team's current findings and the overall expected immaterial impact of adoption, the implementation team is currently evaluating which adoption method would provide the most meaningful information to the Company's stakeholders.
5.Fair Value Measurements



The Company determines fair value measurements based on the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability.
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), establishes a three level hierarchy making a distinction between market participant assumptions based on (i) unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market (Level 1), (ii) quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (Level 2), and (iii) prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement (Level 3).
The Company's cash and cash equivalents (Level 1), which are required to be carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis, were $94.3 million and $311.1 million as of May 31, 2018 and August 31, 2017, respectively.
The Company utilizes valuation methodologies to determine the fair values of its financial assets and liabilities in conformity with the concepts of “exit price” and the fair value hierarchy as prescribed in ASC 820.
There were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values during the current period.
The Company used quoted market prices to determine the fair value of Level 1 assets and liabilities.
No transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy occurred during the current fiscal period.
In the event of a transfer in or out of a level within the fair value hierarchy, the transfers would be recognized on the date of occurrence.
Disclosures of fair value information about financial instruments (whether or not recognized in the balance sheet), for which it is practicable to estimate that value, are required each reporting period in addition to any financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis as prescribed by ASC 825, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825”).
In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)



techniques.
Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.
Fair value is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity (Level 2).
The industrial revenue bond is carried at the outstanding balance as of the end of the reporting period.
The industrial revenue bond is a tax-exempt, variable-rate instrument that resets on a weekly basis; therefore, the Company estimates that the face amount of the bond approximates fair value as of May 31, 2018 based on bonds of similar terms and maturity (Level 2).
The bank loans are carried at the outstanding balance as of the end of the reporting period.
Fair value is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity (Level 2).
The borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility are carried at the outstanding balance as of the end of the reporting period.
The borrowings are variable-rate instruments that reset on a short-term basis; therefore, the Company estimates that the face amount of the notes approximate fair values as of May 31, 2018 based on borrowings of similar terms and maturity (Level 2).
ASC 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements.
Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value to the Company.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names that are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.
The Company recorded amortization expense of $7.2 million and $8.2 million during the three months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $20.5 million and $21.9 million during the nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Amortization expense is generally recorded on a straight-line basis and is expected to be approximately $28.0 million in fiscal 2018, $29.8 million in fiscal 2019, $29.8 million in fiscal 2020, $26.9 million in fiscal 2021, and $25.2 million in fiscal 2022.
These estimated amounts include $1.7 million for fiscal 2018 and $3.8 million for fiscal 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 related to the intangible assets acquired associated with the IOTA and Lucid transactions.
The acquisition accounting and the related useful lives and amortization for the IOTA and Lucid acquisitions are preliminary as the Company continues to gather information related to the identification and valuation of intangible assets acquired.

Other comprehensive income (loss) for the Company includes foreign currency translation and pension adjustments.
The Revolving Credit Facility will mature, and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable, on August 27, 2019.
Generally, amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a Eurocurrency Rate.
Dollars, and amounts outstanding bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for the applicable currency plus a margin as determined by the Company's leverage ratio (“Applicable Margin”).
The Applicable Margin is based on the Company’s leverage ratio, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility, with such margin ranging from 1.000% to 1.575%.
The Company had $1.2 million in borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of May 31, 2018.
Additionally, the Company is required to pay certain fees in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility, including administrative service fees and an annual facility fee.
The annual facility fee is payable quarterly, in arrears, and is determined by the Company’s leverage ratio as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility.
This facility fee ranges from 0.125% to 0.300% of the aggregate $250.0 million commitment of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility.
The Revolving Credit Facility contains financial covenants, including a minimum interest coverage ratio (“Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio”) and a leverage ratio (“Maximum Leverage Ratio”) of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense (“EBITDA”), as such terms are defined in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement.
These ratios are computed at the end of each fiscal quarter for the most recent 12-month period.
The Revolving Credit Facility allows for a Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio of 2.50 and a Maximum Leverage Ratio of 3.50, subject to certain conditions defined in the financing agreement.

The Company also had $3.4 million outstanding under fixed-rate bank loans.
Further discussion of the Company's long-term debt is included within the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within the Company’s Form 10-K. 



Interest Expense, net

16.Income Taxes



On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the TCJA, which reduces the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and requires a one-time transition tax on accumulated unremitted foreign earnings.
This provisional amount included a benefit of $32.3 million to decrease the Company's deferred income taxes to a revised statutory federal rate as well as a current estimate for the provision for unremitted foreign earnings of approximately $1.1 million.
Amounts reflected in the current fiscal year are not finalized as the Company continues to evaluate the impact of the TCJA on these components of the Company's ultimate tax liability.
Upon finalization of this calculation, the provisional amount recorded for unremitted foreign earnings may change.
The Company has not yet made a policy election with respect to its treatment of these taxes.
17.Subsequent Events



On June 29, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks that provides the Company with a $400.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (“New Revolving Credit Facility”) and a $400.0 million unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (“Term Loan Facility”).
On June 29, 2018, the Company had $90.4 million borrowings outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility and no borrowings under the Term Loan Facility.
At June 29, 2018, the Company had additional borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement of $704.3 million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the time, which represents the full amount of the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility less the outstanding letters of credit of $5.3 million issued and $90.4 million in borrowings on the New Revolving Credit Facility.
Available borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, working capital, refinancing indebtedness under the prior Revolving Credit Facility, share repurchases, and non-hostile acquisitions.
The New Revolving Credit Facility replaced the Company's $250.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, which was scheduled to mature on August 27, 2019.
Generally, amounts outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility allow for borrowings to bear interest at either the Eurocurrency Rate or the base rate at the Company's option.
Dollars, and amounts outstanding bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to the LIBOR for the applicable currency plus an applicable margin.
The Eurocurrency applicable margin is based on the Company’s leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, with such margin ranging from 1.000% to 1.375%.
Base Rate advances bear interest at an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin.
The base rate applicable margin is based on the Company’s leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, with such margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.375%.
The Term Loan Facility allows for borrowings to be drawn over a one-year period ending June 29, 2019, utilizing up to four separate installments, which are U.S. dollar denominated.
Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will amortize in equal quarterly installments of 2.5% per year in year one, 2.5% per year in year two, 5.0% per year in year three, 5.0% per year in year four, and 7.5% per year in year five.
Any remaining borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are due and payable in full on June 29, 2023.
The Term Loan Facility allows for borrowings to bear interest at either a Eurocurrency Rate or the base rate, at the Company’s option.
Dollars, and amounts outstanding bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR for the applicable currency plus an applicable margin.
The Eurocurrency applicable margin is based on the 



16

ACUITY BRANDS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)



Company’s leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, with such margin ranging from 0.875% to 1.250%.
Base Rate advances bear interest at an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin.
The base rate applicable margin is based on the Company’s leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, with such margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.25%.
The Company is required to pay certain fees in connection with the Credit Agreement, including administrative service fees and annual facility fees.
The annual facility fee is payable quarterly, in arrears, and is determined by the Company’s leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement.
The facility fee ranges from 0.125% to 0.250% of the aggregate $800.0 million commitment of the lenders under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants, including a minimum interest expense coverage ratio (“New Minimum Interest Expense Coverage Ratio”) and a leverage ratio (“New Maximum Leverage Ratio”) of total indebtedness to EBITDA, as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement.
These ratios are computed at the end of each fiscal quarter for the most recent 12-month period.
The Credit Agreement generally allows for a New Minimum Interest Expense Coverage Ratio of 2.50 and a New Maximum Leverage Ratio of 3.50, subject to certain conditions defined in the financing agreement.
18.Supplemental Guarantor Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements



In December 2009, ABL, the 100% owned and principal operating subsidiary of Acuity Brands, refinanced the then current outstanding debt through the issuance of the Unsecured Notes.
See Debt and Lines of Credit footnote for further information.
In accordance with the registration rights agreement by and between ABL and the guarantors to the Unsecured Notes and the initial purchasers of the Unsecured Notes, ABL and the guarantors to the Notes filed a registration statement with the SEC for an offer to exchange the Unsecured Notes for an issue of SEC-registered notes with identical terms.
Due to the filing of the registration statement and offer to exchange, the Company determined the need for compliance with Rule 3-10 of SEC Regulation S-X (“Rule 3-10”).
In lieu of providing separate audited financial statements for ABL and ABL IP Holding, the Company has included the accompanying Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements in accordance with Rule 3-10(d) of SEC Regulation S-X since the Unsecured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Acuity Brands and ABL IP Holding.
The column marked “Parent” represents the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of Acuity Brands.
The column marked “Subsidiary Issuer” represents the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of ABL.
The column entitled “Subsidiary Guarantor” represents the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of ABL IP Holding.
Lastly, the column listed as “Non-Guarantors” includes the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the non-guarantor direct and indirect subsidiaries of Acuity Brands, which consist primarily of foreign subsidiaries.
Consolidating adjustments were necessary in order to arrive at consolidated amounts.
In addition, the equity method of accounting was used to calculate investments in subsidiaries.
