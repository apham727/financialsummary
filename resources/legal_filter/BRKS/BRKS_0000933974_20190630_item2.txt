In the life sciences sample-based services market, we utilize our core competencies and capabilities in automation and cryogenics to provide comprehensive bio-sample management solutions to a broad range of end markets within the life sciences industry. Our offerings include automated ultra-cold storage freezers, consumable sample storage 
containers, instruments which assist in the workflow of sample management, on-site and off-site full sample management services, gene sequencing services and gene synthesis services. We expect the life sciences sample management market to remain one of our principal markets for our product and service offerings and provide favorable opportunities for the growth of our overall business. Over the past several years, we have acquired and developed essential capabilities required to strategically address the sample management needs across multiple end markets within the life sciences industry. In October 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of 4titude Limited, or 4titude, a U.K.-based manufacturer of scientific consumables for biological sample materials used in a variety of genomic and DNA analytical applications. The acquisition has expanded our existing offerings of consumables and instruments within the Brooks Life Sciences segment. In April 2018, we acquired BioSpeciMan Corporation, a Canadian provider of storage services for biological sample materials. The acquisition has expanded customer relationships and geographic reach within our growing sample management storage services business. On November 15, 2018, we acquired GENEWIZ Group, or GENEWIZ, a leading global genomics service provider headquartered in South Plainfield, New Jersey. GENEWIZ is a global leader in genomics services that enable research scientists to advance their discoveries within the pharmaceutical, academic, biotechnology, agriculture and other markets. GENEWIZ provides gene sequencing and synthesis services for more than 4,000 institutional customers worldwide supported by their global network of laboratories spanning the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. This transaction has added a new and innovative platform which we expect to leverage, along with our core capabilities, to add even more value to samples under our care. Please refer to Note 5, “Acquisitions” in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on these transactions. Since entering the life sciences industry, we have also strengthened and broadened our product portfolio and market reach by investing in internal product development and sales and marketing infrastructure. We expect to continue investing in research and development and making strategic acquisitions and other investments with the objective of expanding our offerings in the life sciences sample management market. 
Results of Operations - Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased to $203.9 million, or by 18%, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin was 41.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 38.8% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $16.7 million. Operating expenses were $67.1 million during the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $54.3 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $12.8 million.

Income from continuing operations was $0.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, as compared to $4.8 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. 
Results of Operations - Revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 increased to $581.6 million, or by 23%, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin was 40.6% for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 38.9% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $52.6 million. Operating expenses were $200.7 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $155.7 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $45.0 million. Operating income was $35.4 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $27.8 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Income from continuing operations was $4.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $68.9 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease of $64.6 million was primarily attributable to the reversal of the valuation allowance reserve against U.S. deferred income tax benefits of $56.3 million in the prior fiscal year, and a $9.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the 2019 period, partially offset by increased operating income and a decrease in foreign currency exchange losses in the 2019 period compared to the prior year period. 
Cash Flows and Liquidity - Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $159.8 million at June 30, 2019 as compared to $251.2 million at September 30, 2018. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $91.5 million was primarily attributable to net cash outflows of $442.7 million to acquire GENEWIZ, cash dividends paid of $21.7 million and capital expenditures of $15.5 million, partially offset by net cash inflows primarily from proceeds received in connection with the amendment and syndication of our incremental term loan of $331.4 million, proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $51.5 million and net cash inflows from operating activities of $58.2 million as of June 30, 2019. Cash inflows from operating activities of $58.2 million was comprised of $76.6 million of net earnings, including net income of $25.1 million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $51.5 million, partially offset by uses of cash of $18.4 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions. 
For a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable to our unaudited consolidated financial statements, please refer to Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
We reported revenue of $203.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $172.4 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $31.5 million, or 18%. We reported revenue of $581.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $471.9 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $109.7 million, or 23%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting guidance for recognizing revenue on a modified retrospective basis. The difference in reported revenue due to the 
adoption of the standard was a net decrease of $0.9 million and $2.4 million during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. 
Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported revenue of $116.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $122.7 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, a decrease of $6.6 million, or 5%. We reported a decline in automation systems revenue of $13.0 million and services revenue of $1.0 million, which were partially offset by an increase in contamination control systems of $7.3 million. For the nine months ended June 30, 2019, our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported revenue of $341.6 million compared to $326.2 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $15.4 million, or 5%. We reported an increase in contamination control solutions of $35.7 million, of which $15.1 million is attributable to six additional months of revenue for the acquisition of Tec-Sem, acquired on April 1, 2019, this was partially offset by declines in automation systems of $19.1 million and services of $1.2 million. The semiconductor markets are cyclical and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Demand for our Brooks Semiconductor Solution Group products is affected by these cycles. The difference in reported revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net increase of $0.2 million and $0.8 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported revenue of $87.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $49.7 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $38.1 million, or 77%, was composed of $37.1 million from acquisitions, and $1.1 million from internal growth, driven by increases in sales of BioStoreTM III Cryostores, sample storage services, infrastructure services, and consumables and instruments, partially offset by declines in automated cold storage systems. For the nine months ended June 30, 2019, our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported revenue of $240.0 million, compared to $145.7 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $94.3 million, or 65% was composed of $86.3 million from acquisitions, and $8.0 million from internal growth, principally in sample storage services, consumables and instruments, infrastructure services, and BioStoreTM III Cryostores, partially offset by declines in automated cold storage systems and informatics solutions. The difference in reported revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net decrease of $1.0 million and $3.3 million during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. 
Revenue generated outside the United States was $115.7 million, or 57% of total revenue, for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $110.7 million, or 64% of total revenue, for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Revenue generated outside the United States was $342.4 million, or 59% of total revenue, for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 compared to $298.0 million, or 63% of total revenue, for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. We had no customers that accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue for each of the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. 
We reported gross margins of 41.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 38.8% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin increased in the Brooks Life Sciences Segment by 3.6 percentage points and in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment by 1.6 percentage points in the 2019 period over the 2018 period. We reported gross margins of 40.6% for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 compared to 38.9% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin increased in the Brooks Life Sciences segment by 3.7 percentage points and in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group by 0.1 percentage points in the 2019 period over the 2018 period. Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 also included $0.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting, as compared to $0.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Excluding the purchasing accounting impact related to inventory step-up and the amortization of completed technology, gross margins expanded 2.3 percentage points and 1.9 percentage points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The difference in reported gross margin due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net decrease in gross profit of $0.4 million and $0.9 million during three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. 
Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported gross margins of 40.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 39.3% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is driven by 
favorable customer mix and product mix. Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported gross margins of 40.8% for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 39.9% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase is driven primarily by customer and product mix and productivity improvements in our services reporting unit. Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 included $0.9 million and $2.7 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $1.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, incurred during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The results for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 included $0.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting as compared to $0.8 million during both the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Excluding the purchase accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 0.8 percentage points, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The difference in reported gross margin due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net increase in gross profit of $0.2 million and $0.8 million during three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported gross margins of 41.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 37.4% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported gross margins of 40.3% for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 36.6% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase during both periods was due to a higher margin revenue mix from GENEWIZ. Cost of revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 included $2.0 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $0.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively, incurred during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The results for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 included $0.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting as compared to no such charges during both the corresponding periods of the current fiscal year. Excluding the purchase accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 5.1 percentage points and 4.2 percentage points, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The difference in reported gross margin due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net decrease in gross profit of $0.6 million and $1.8 million during three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively.
Research and development expenses were $14.2 million and $41.5 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $12.0 million and $34.8 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $2.2 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2018 reflects higher expense of $1.2 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment and $1.0 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment. The increase of $6.7 million during the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the same period of fiscal year 2018 reflects higher expense of $3.8 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment and $2.9 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment. Higher expenses in both periods were primarily attributable to new acquisitions, project spending to support new product development and the growth of our business and higher employee related costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $52.6 million and $158.5 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $42.1 million and $120.7 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $10.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior year was primarily attributable to the selling, general and administrative infrastructure at GENEWIZ, and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of GENEWIZ. These impacts were partially offset by lower expense accruals in the 2019 period as compared to the 2018 period related to variable compensation and lower professional services and merger and acquisition related expenses. The increase of $37.8 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year was driven by selling, general and administrative expenses related to the acquisitions of GENEWIZ and Tec Sem and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in connection with both acquisitions and higher merger and acquisition related expenses, partially offset by lower expenses related to 
professional services and variable compensation as compared to the 2018 period. The nine months ended June 30, 2019 included a $1.1 million credit related to an insurance claim.
Amortization expense related primarily to customer relationships was $6.2 million and $18.6 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $5.1 million and $14.3 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Merger-related costs were $0.2 million and $6.6 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $0.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The increases in amortization expense and merger costs during 2019 are primarily due to the acquisition of GENEWIZ.
Interest income - During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded interest income of $0.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, as compared to $0.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. 
Interest expense - During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded interest expense of $8.0 million and $21.3 million, respectively, as compared to $2.5 million and $6.8 million, respectively, during corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase in interest expense in the 2019 periods compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year are due to interest on the incremental term loan secured in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 to pay a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of GENEWIZ.
Loss on extinguishment of debt - During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $9.1 million in connection with the syndication of the incremental term loan secured during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The syndication to a new group of lenders during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 met the criteria of a debt extinguishment and therefore the amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the origination of the incremental term loan was accelerated and recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt in our statement of operations.
We recorded an income tax expense of $7.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019. The tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily driven by a $4.3 million discrete expense resulting from guidance provided with final U.S. tax regulations issued during the quarter related to the transition tax, and the tax provision on current earnings based on estimated annual mix of income by jurisdiction. These expenses were partially offset by a discrete benefit for stock compensation windfalls of $0.4 million for tax deductions that exceeded the associated compensation expense, and a $0.3 million reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit upon the closing of an audit. The tax expense for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily driven by a $3.2 million expense related to the completion of the accounting for the U.S. transition tax and the tx provision on current earnings based on estimated annual mix of income by jurisdiction. These expenses were partially offset by discrete benefits related to stock compensation windfalls of $4.5 million for tax deductions that exceeded the associated compensation expense, and $1.4 million of tax benefits related to the remeasurement of net U.S. deferred tax assets due to state tax rate changes.
We recorded an income tax provision of $5.4 million and benefit of $49.8 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018. The tax provision for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was the result of our earnings for the period. The tax benefit recorded during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily driven by a discrete benefit due to the reversal of a valuation allowance against U.S. net deferred tax assets in the amount of $56.3 
We generated revenue and net income from discontinued operations of $34.5 million and $6.3 million, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2019 related to our semiconductor cryogenics business as compared to $51.1 million and $17.8 million, respectively, for the corresponding period of fiscal 2018. We generated revenue and net income from discontinued operations of $109.5 million and $20.7 million, respectively, for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 related to our semiconductor cryogenics business as compared to $148.2 million and $37.2 million, respectively, for the corresponding period of fiscal 2018. The net income includes income from the Ulvac Cryogenics, Inc. joint venture during these periods. The income from discontinued operations only includes direct operating expenses incurred that (1) are clearly identifiable as costs being disposed of upon completion of the sale and (2) will not be continued by the 
Company on an ongoing basis. Indirect expenses which supported the semiconductor cryogenics business, and which will remain as part of the continuing operations, are not reflected in income from discontinued operations.
The discussion of our cash flows and liquidity that follows does not include the impact of the disposition of the semiconductor cryogenics business and is stated on a total company consolidated basis.
Our cash is held in numerous locations throughout the world. As of June 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $156.9 million, of which $112.3 million was held outside of the United States. If these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would need to repatriate these funds. As a result of recent changes in U.S. tax legislation, any repatriation in the future would likely not result in further U.S. federal income tax. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current operating plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds for our U.S. operations. As of June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we had marketable securities of $2.9 million and $53.5 million, respectively. Our marketable securities are generally readily convertible to cash without an adverse impact.
On July 1, 2019, subsequent to this third fiscal quarter reporting period, the sale of the semiconductor cryogenics business was completed. Cash received on July 1, 2019 was $669 million, of which, $3 million was placed in escrow. The Company estimates obligations related to the sale include estimated closing costs of $13 million and estimated taxes of $105 million, resulting in estimated net proceeds from the sale of $550 million, subject to final working capital and other adjustments. From the cash received on July 1, 2019 related to the sale, $348.3 million was applied to fully extinguish the balance of our incremental term loan and $147.0 million was applied to reduce the balance outstanding of our term loan. The impact on the cash balance on July 1, 2019 due to the cash received from the sale partially offset by the application of the proceeds received to reduce debt, was a net increase of $173.4 million. The Company expects to settle the other obligations from the sale including estimated closing costs of $13 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, and estimated taxes of $105 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. As described above, the Company routinely invests certain amounts of its cash balance in marketable securities. 
When considering only the cash received related to the sale of the semiconductor cryogenics business and the debt reductions made on July 1, 2019, as mentioned above, the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities reported as of June 30, 2019 on our Consolidated Balance Sheet of $159.8 million increased $173.4 million to $333.2 million. Similarly, the long-term debt reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2019 of $534.7 million 
decreased by $491.8 million on July 1, 2019 to $42.9 million and the current portion of long-term debt reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet of $6.3 million as of June 30, 2019 decreased to $2.8 million on July 1, 2019. Total current liabilities reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2019 of $175.0 million increased on July 1, 2019 by approximately $118 million due to liabilities assumed related to the sale for the estimated tax payments of $105 million and estimated closing costs of $13 million, as mentioned above. 
Cash provided by operating activities was $58.2 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2019, comprised primarily of earnings of $76.6 million, including net income of $25.1 million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $51.5 million. Partially offsetting these items were the uses of cash of $18.4 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in a use of cash consisted primarily of a decrease in accrued compensation and tax withholdings as a result of year-end cash incentive bonus payments, an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher revenue, an increase in inventory levels primarily related to our automation systems product lines, and increase in accounts payable. These uses of cash were partially offset by sources of cash related primarily to increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses and other liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities was $42.8 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 comprised primarily of earnings of $95.0 million, including net income of $106.1 million and the unfavorable impact of non-cash related charges of $11.1 million, partially offset by the uses of cash of $52.2 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. 
In April 2019, we committed to construct a facility in Suzhou China, to consolidate the Suzhou operations of its GENEWIZ business and provide an infrastructure to support future growth. The facility will be constructed in two phases. We expect to incur $50.0 to $55.0 million of capital expenditures related to this facility over the next five years, of which up to $10.0 million is expected to be incurred during 2019. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, we have incurred $0.1 million in capital expenditures related to the construction of this facility. 
On July 1, 2019, we completed the sale of our semiconductor cryogenics business to Edwards Vacuum LLC (a member of the Atlas Copco Group) for $675.0 million. We expect net cash proceeds from the sale to be approximately $550 million, after adjustments and deducting taxes and other items. On July 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the sale, we used $348.3 million of the cash proceeds from the sale to extinguish the total remaining outstanding balance of the incremental term loan and $147.0 million of the cash proceeds from the sale to extinguish a portion of the outstanding balance of the term loan. The total amount of debt extinguished on July 1, 2019 was $495.3 million.
The term loans mature and becomes fully payable on October 4, 2024. Installment principal payments equal to 0.25% of the initial principal amount of the term loan are payable on the last day of each quarter, with any remaining principal amount becoming due and payable on the maturity date. During the nine months ended June 30, 2019, we made principal payments of $3.3 million related to the term loans. Subject to certain conditions stated in the credit agreement, we may redeem the term loans at any time at our option without a significant premium or penalty, except for 
a repricing transaction, as defined in the original credit agreement and the Amendment. We would also be required to redeem the term loan at the principal amounts then outstanding upon the occurrence of certain events, as set forth in the original credit agreement and the Amendment. 
On July 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the sale of our semiconductor cryogenics business, we used $348.3 million of the cash proceeds from the sales to extinguish the outstanding balance of the incremental term loan and $147.0 of the cash proceeds from the sales to extinguish a portion of the outstanding balance of the term loan. The total amount of debt extinguished on July 1, 2019 was $495.3 million. At July 1, 2019, our total outstanding debt balance was approximately $46 million as a result of the debt extinguishment.
In connection with the GENEWIZ acquisition, we assumed three five-year term loans and two one-year term loans. At June 30, 2019, we had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $1.7 million for the three five-year term loans. The two one-year short term loans matured and were repaid in full as of June 30, 2019. 
At June 30, 2019, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the term loans was $541.1 million, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs of $5.8 million. Borrowings under the term loan bear variable interest rates. As a result, we may experience exposure to interest rate risk due to the potential volatility associated with the variable interest rates on the term loan. If rates increase, we may be subject to higher costs of servicing the loan which could reduce our profitability and cash flows. During the nine months ended June 30, 2019, the weighted average stated interest rate on the term loan was 5.4%. During the nine months ended June 30, 2019, we incurred aggregate interest expense of $21.3 million on the term loans including $1.3 million of deferred financing costs amortization. Our debt service requirements are expected to be funded through our existing sources of liquidity and operating cash flows. 
The credit agreement and the Amendment contain certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default. As of June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions under the credit agreement.
As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately $48.7 million available for borrowing under the line of credit. There were no amounts outstanding pursuant to the line of credit as of June 30, 2019. The amount of funds available for borrowing under the credit agreement may fluctuate each period based on our borrowing base availability. The credit agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, a financial covenant, affirmative and negative covenants, as well as events of default. We were in compliance with the credit agreement as of June 30, 2019. Although we believe we will be able to generate sufficient cash in the United States and foreign jurisdictions to fund future operating costs, we secured the revolving line of credit as an additional assurance for maintaining liquidity in the United States during potentially severe downturns of the cyclical semiconductor market, and for strategic investments or acquisitions. 
On July 31, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share payable on September 27, 2019 to common stockholders of record as of September 6, 2019. Dividends are declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend on actual cash flow from operations, our financial condition, debt service and capital requirements, and any other factors our Board of Directors may consider relevant. We intend to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future; however, the amount and timing of these dividends may be impacted by the cyclical nature 
Our non-cancellable inventory purchase commitments were $97.2 million at June 30, 2019. 
As of June 30, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.
