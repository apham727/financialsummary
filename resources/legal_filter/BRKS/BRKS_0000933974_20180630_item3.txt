 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
 Interest Rate Exposure  
 Our term loan bears variable interest rates which subjects us to interest rate risk. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in the short-term LIBOR rate, the federal funds effective rate and the prime rate. As of June 30, 2018, the weighted average stated interest rate on the term loan was 4.5%. At June 30, 2018, the outstanding term loan principal balance was $199.0 million, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs of $2.5 million. During the nine months ended June 30, 2018, we incurred interest expense of $6.3 million on the term loan. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a $1.5 million change in interest expense incurred during the nine months ended June 30, 2018.  
 Currency Rate Exposure  
 In the normal course of our business, we have liquid assets denominated in non-functional currencies which include cash, short-term advances between our legal entities and accounts receivable which are subject to foreign currency exposure. Such balances were approximately $154.9 million and $51.6 million, respectively, at June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, and related to the Euro, British Pound and a variety of Asian currencies. We mitigate the impact of potential currency translation losses on these short-term intercompany advances by the timely settlement of each transaction, generally within 30 days. We also utilize forward contracts to mitigate our exposures to currency movement. We incurred foreign currency losses of $3.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively, during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, which related to the currency fluctuation on these balances between the time the transaction occurred and the ultimate settlement of the transaction. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates at June 30, 2018 and 2017 would result in an approximate change of $5.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in our net income during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.
