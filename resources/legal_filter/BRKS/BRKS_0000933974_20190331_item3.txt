 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
 Interest Rate Exposure  
 Our term loans bear variable interest rates which subject us to interest rate risk. Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in the short-term LIBOR rate, the federal funds effective rate and the prime rate. As of March 31, 2019, the weighted average stated interest rate on the term loans was 5.2%. At March 31, 2019, the outstanding term loans principal balance was $543.5 million, net of unamortized deferred financing costs of $6.1 million. During the six months ended March 31, 2019, we incurred cash interest expense of $12.3 million on the term loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a $2.5 million change in interest expense incurred during the six months ended March 31, 2019.  
 Currency Rate Exposure  
 In the normal course of our business, we have liquid assets denominated in non-functional currencies which include cash, short-term advances between our legal entities and accounts receivable which are subject to foreign currency exposure. Such balances were approximately $140.5 million and $84.7 million, respectively, at March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018, and related to the Euro, British Pound and a variety of Asian currencies. We mitigate the impact of potential currency translation losses on these short-term intercompany advances by the timely settlement of each transaction, generally within 30 days. We also utilize forward contracts to mitigate our exposures to currency movement. We incurred foreign currency losses of $0.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively, during the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, which related to the currency fluctuation on these balances between the time the transaction occurred and the ultimate settlement of the transaction. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates at March 31, 2019 and 2018 would result in an approximate change of $2.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, in our net income during the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
