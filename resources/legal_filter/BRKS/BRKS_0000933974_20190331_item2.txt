The acquisition has expanded customer relationships and geographic reach within our growing sample management storage services business. On November 15, 2018, we acquired GENEWIZ Group, or GENEWIZ, a leading global genomics service provider headquartered in South Plainfield, New Jersey. GENEWIZ is a global leader in genomics services that enable research scientists to advance their discoveries within the pharmaceutical, academic, biotechnology, agriculture and other markets. GENEWIZ provides gene sequencing and synthesis services for more than 4,000 institutional customers worldwide supported by their global network of laboratories spanning the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. This transaction has added a new and innovative platform which we expect to leverage, along with our core capabilities, to add even more value to samples under our care. GENEWIZ is reported within the Brooks Life Sciences segment. Please refer to Note 5, “Acquisitions” in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q for further information on these transactions. Since entering the life sciences industry, we have also strengthened and broadened our product portfolio and market reach by investing in internal product development and sales and marketing infrastructure. We expect to continue investing in research and development and making strategic acquisitions and other investments with the objective of expanding our offerings in the life sciences sample management market.   
 Results of Operations - Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased to $198.4 million, or by 26%, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin was 40.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to 39.7% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $18.1 million. Operating expenses were $66.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to $52.1 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $14.8 million. Operating income was $13.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 as compared to $10.3 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Loss from continuing operations was $2.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, which includes a $9.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt. This compares to income from continuing operations of $62.5 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, which included the reversal of the valuation allowance reserve against U.S. deferred income tax assets of $58.0 million.   
 Results of Operations - Revenue for the six months ended March 31, 2019 increased to $377.8 million, or by 26%, as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin was 40.4% for the six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to 38.9% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $36.0 million. Operating expenses were $133.6 million during the six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to $101.4 million during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $32.2 million. Operating income was $19.0 million during the six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to $15.2 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Income from continuing operations was $3.4 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to $64.1 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease of $60.7 million was primarily attributable to the reversal of the valuation allowance reserve against U.S. deferred income tax benefits of $58.0 million in the prior fiscal year, and a $9.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the 2019 period.   
 Cash Flows and Liquidity - Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $140.1 million at March 31, 2019 as compared to $251.2 million at September 30, 2018. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $111.2 million was primarily attributable to net cash outflows of $442.7 million to acquire GENEWIZ, cash dividends paid of $14.4 million and capital expenditures of $9.7 million, partially offset by net cash inflows primarily from proceeds received from the incremental amendment and syndication of our existing term loan of $334.1 million, proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $51.5 million and net cash inflows from operating activities of $22.2 million. Cash inflows from operating activities of $22.2 million was comprised of $48.0 million of net earnings, including net income of $17.8 million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $30.2 million, partially offset by uses of cash of $25.8 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions.   
 For a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable to our unaudited consolidated financial statements, please refer to Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 "Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q.   
 We reported revenue of $198.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to $157.0 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $41.4 million, or 26%. We reported revenue of $377.8 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019, compared to $299.6 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $78.2 million, or 26%. We reported revenue growth in both the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and the Brooks Life Sciences segment for both periods. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting guidance for recognizing revenue on a modified retrospective basis. The difference in reported 
revenue due to the adoption of the standard was a net decrease of $1.2 million and $1.6 million during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019, respectively.   
 Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported revenue of $112.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $108.4 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $4.5 million, or 4%. For the six months ended March 31, 2019, our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported revenue of $225.6 million compared to $203.6 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase of $22.0 million, or 11%. The increase in both periods was primarily driven by increases in sales of contamination control solutions products and automation systems, partially offset by a decline in sales of robotic automation products and automation services. Growth in contamination controls solutions for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 was $14.2 million and $28.4 million respectively, which is inclusive of revenue from the acquisition of Tec Sem of $5.7 million and $15.1 million, respectively. The semiconductor markets are cyclical and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Demand for our Brooks Semiconductor Solution Group products is affected by these cycles. The difference in reported revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net increase of $0.2 million and $0.7 million for the three and six months ended March, 31, 2019, respectively.  
 Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported revenue of $85.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $48.5 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $37.0 million, or 76%, was composed of $33.2 million from acquisitions, and $3.8 million from internal growth, principally from consumables and instruments, automated systems and sample storage services. For the six months ended March 31, 2019, our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported revenue of $152.2 million, compared to $96.0 million for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $56.2 million, or 59%, was composed of $49.8 million from acquisitions, and $6.4 million from internal growth, principally in consumables and instruments, automated systems, and sample management services. The difference in reported revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net decrease of $1.4 million and $2.2 million during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019, respectively.   
 Revenue generated outside the United States was $115.7 million, or 58% of total revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $96.5 million, or 62% of total revenue, for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Revenue generated outside the United States was $227.0 million, or 60% of total revenue, for the six months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $187.4 million, or 63% of total revenue, for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. We had no customers that accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue for each of the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.   
 We reported gross margins of 40.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to 39.7% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin increased in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment by 0.7 percentage points and in the Brooks Life Sciences segment by 1.4 percentage points in the 2019 period over the 2018 period. We reported gross margins of 40.4% for the six months ended March 31, 2019 compared to 38.9% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Gross margin increased in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment by 0.5 percentage points and in the Brooks Life Sciences segment by 3.7 percentage points in the 2019 period over the 2018 period. Cost of revenue for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 included $2.8 million and $4.8 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $1.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Cost of revenue for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 also included $0.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting, as compared to $0.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Excluding the purchasing accounting impact related to inventory step-up and the amortization of completed technology, gross margins expanded 1.6 percentage points and 1.7 percentage points, respectively, during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The difference in reported gross margin due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net decrease in gross profit of $0.7 million and $0.8 million during three and six months ended March 31, 2019, respectively.   
 Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported gross margins of 40.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to 40.1% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Our Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment reported gross margins of 40.7% for the six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to 40.3% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in both periods was driven by lower production costs attributable to product and customer mix and production efficiencies. Cost of revenue for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 included $0.9 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $0.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, incurred during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The results for the six months ended March 31, 2019 included $0.2 million of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting as compared to no such charges during both the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Excluding the purchase accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 0.9 percentage points and 0.8 percentage points, respectively, during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The difference in reported gross margin due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net increase in gross profit of $0.2 million and $0.7 million during three and six months ended March 31, 2019, respectively.  
 Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported gross margins of 40.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to 39.0% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. Our Brooks Life Sciences segment reported gross margins of 39.9% for the six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to 36.1% for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. The increase during both periods was primarily due to a higher margin revenue mix from GENEWIZ, volume leverage of fixed costs, and higher margins from our consumables and instruments product lines. These factors were partially offset by lower margins on automated store projects due to cost overruns. Cost of revenue for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 included $1.9 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of charges for amortization related to completed technology as compared to $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, incurred during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The results for the six months ended March 31, 2018 included $1.2 million of charges related to the inventory step-up in purchase accounting as compared to no such charges during both the corresponding periods of the current fiscal year. Excluding the purchase accounting impact and the amortization of completed technology, margins expanded 2.7 percentage points and 3.6 percentage points, respectively, during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The difference in reported gross margin due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard was a net decrease in gross profit of $0.9 million and $1.2 million during three and six months ended March 31, 2019, respectively.  
 Research and development expenses were $14.1 million and $27.2 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to $11.3 million and $22.8 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase of $2.8 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal year 2018 reflects higher expense of $1.8 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment and $1.0 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment. The increase of $4.4 million during the first half of fiscal year 2019 reflects higher expense of $2.5 million within the Brooks Life Sciences segment and $1.9 million within the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment. Higher expenses in both periods were primarily attributable to new acquisitions and higher employee related costs.   
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were $52.4 million and $105.9 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to $40.7 million and $78.6 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase of 11.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior year was primarily attributable to the selling, general and administrative infrastructure at GENEWIZ, and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of GENEWIZ and Tec Sem. The prior year corresponding period also included a $1.1 million credit, related to an insurance claim. These impacts were partially offset by lower expense accruals in 2019 related to variable compensation and lower merger and acquisition related expenses. In addition to the factors mentioned above, additional merger-related costs drove the increase of $27.3 million during the six months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.  
 Amortization expense related primarily to customer relationships was $6.6 million and $12.4 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to $4.6 million and $9.2 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Merger-related costs were $0.0 million and $6.4 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to $1.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The increases in amortization expense and merger costs during 2019 are due to the acquisition of GENEWIZ.  
 Interest income - During the three and six months ended March 31, 2019, we recorded interest income of $0.3 million and $0.8 million, respectively, as compared to $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively, during the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year.   
 Interest expense - During the three and six months ended March 31, 2019, we recorded interest expense of $8.0 million and $13.3 million, respectively, as compared to $2.2 million and $4.4 million during corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The increase in interest expense is due to interest on the $350.0 million incremental term loan secured in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 used to pay a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of GENEWIZ.  
 Loss on extinguishment of debt - During the three and six months ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $9.1 million in connection with the syndication of the $350.0 million term loan secured during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The syndication to a new group of lenders during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 met the criteria of a debt extinguishment and therefore the amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the origination of the loan was accelerated and recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt on our statement of operations.  
 Other expenses, net - During the three and six months ended March 31, 2019, we recorded other expenses, net of $0.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, as compared to $0.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of the corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. The $1.6 million decrease during the six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to lower foreign currency exchange losses.  
 We recorded an income tax benefit of $1.0 million and $6.9 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019. The tax benefit for three months was driven by U.S. losses during the period and includes $0.4 million of stock compensation windfalls. These benefits were slightly offset by the tax provision on foreign earnings during the period and a discrete expense related to interest accruing on uncertain tax positions. The tax benefit for the six months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily driven by discrete benefits related to stock compensation windfalls of $4.1 million for tax deductions that exceeded the associated compensation expense, $1.4 million of tax benefits related to the remeasurement of net U.S. deferred tax assets due to state tax rate changes, and a $1.1 million transition tax reduction. These discrete benefits were slightly increased by the tax benefit recorded on losses during the period.   
 We recorded an income tax benefit of $54.5 million and $55.2 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended March 31, 2018. The tax benefit recorded during each period was primarily driven by a discrete benefit due to the reversal of a valuation allowance against U.S. net deferred tax assets during the three months ended March 31, 2018 in the amount of $58.0 million. The tax benefit for the six months ended March 31, 2018 included $0.7 million of tax benefits related to the re-measurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to account for the reduced 21 percent statutory federal income tax rate. This benefit for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 was partially offset by the tax provisions related to foreign income.  
 We generated revenue and net income from discontinued operations of $35.7 million and $6.3 million, respectively for the three months ended March 31, 2019 related to our semiconductor cryogenics business as compared to $50.3 million and $4.5 million, respectively, for the corresponding period of fiscal 2018. We generated revenue and net income from discontinued operations of $75.0 million and $14.4 million, respectively for the six months ended March 31, 2019 related to our semiconductor cryogenics business as compared to $97.0 million and $19.4 million, respectively, for the corresponding period of fiscal 2018. The net income includes income from the Ulvac Cryogenics, Inc. joint venture during these periods. The income from discontinued operations only includes direct operating expenses incurred that (1) are clearly identifiable as costs being disposed of upon completion of the sale and (2) will not be continued by the Company on an ongoing basis. Indirect expenses which supported the Cryogenics business, and which will remain as part of the continuing operations, are not reflected in income from discontinued operations.  
 The discussion of our cash flows and liquidity that follows does not include the impact of the disposition of our cryogenics business and is stated on a total company consolidated basis.  
 Our cash is held in numerous locations throughout the world. As of March 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $137.2 million, of which $111.1 million was held outside of the United States. If these funds are needed for the U.S. operations, we would need to repatriate these funds. As a result of recent changes in U.S. tax legislation, any repatriation in the future would likely not result in further U.S. federal income tax. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current operating plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds for our U.S. operations. As of March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we had marketable securities of $2.8 million and $53.5 million, respectively. Our marketable securities are generally readily convertible to cash without an adverse impact.  
 Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as earnings, working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and other operating charges impact reported cash flows.  
 Cash provided by operating activities was $22.2 million during the six months ended March 31, 2019, comprised primarily of earnings of $48.0 million, including net income of $17.8 million and the impact of non-cash related charges of $30.2 million. Partially offsetting these items were the uses of cash of $25.8 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in a use of cash consisted primarily of an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher revenue, an increase in inventory levels to support the growth of our business and a decrease in accrued compensation and tax withholdings as a result of year-end cash incentive bonus payments. These uses of cash were partially offset by sources of cash related primarily to increases in accounts payable. Cash provided by operating activities was $23.4 million during the six months ended March 31, 2018 comprised primarily of earnings of $57.6 million, including net income of $83.5 million and the unfavorable impact of non-cash related charges of $25.9 million, partially offset by the use of $34.2 million related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities.   
 In April 2019, the Company committed to construct a facility in Suzhou China, to consolidate the Suzhou operations of its GENEWIZ business and provide an infrastructure to support future growth. The facility will be constructed in two phases. The company expects to incur $50.0 to $55.0 million of capital expenditures over the next five years, of which up to $10.0 million is expected to be incurred during 2019.  
 On October 4, 2017, we entered into a $200.0 million term loan with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. The term loan was issued at $197.6 million, or 98.8% of its par value, resulting in a discount of $2.4 million, or 1.2%, which represented loan origination fees paid at the closing. On November 15, 2018, we entered into an incremental amendment, or the Amendment to the existing credit agreement. Under the Amendment, we obtained an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million. The proceeds of the incremental loan were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of GENEWIZ acquisition. The term loan was issued at $340.5 million, or 97.3% of its par value, resulting in a discount of $9.5 million, or 2.7%, which represented financing cost of the loan. Except as provided in the Amendment, the incremental loan is subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in the existing credit agreement. The loan principal amount may be increased by an aggregate amount equal to $75.0 million plus any voluntary repayments of the term loans plus any additional amount such that the secured leverage ratio of the Company is less than 3.00 to 1.00.   
 The term loans mature and becomes fully payable on October 4, 2024. Installment principal payments equal to 0.25% of the initial principal amount of the term loan are payable on the last day of each quarter, with any remaining principal amount becoming due and payable on the maturity date. During the six months ended March 31, 2019, we made principal payments of $3.2 million related to the term loans. Subject to certain conditions stated in the term loan agreement, we may redeem the term loans at any time at our option without a significant premium or penalty, except for a repricing transaction, as defined in the original term loan agreement and the Amendment. We would also be required to redeem the term loan at the principal amounts then outstanding upon the occurrence of certain events, as set forth in the original term loan agreement and the Amendment.   
 In connection with the GENEWIZ acquisition, we assumed three five-year term loans and two one-year term loans. At March 31, 2019, we had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $3.9 million for these term loans.   
 At March 31, 2019, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the term loans was $543.5 million, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs of $6.1 million. Borrowings under the term loan bear variable interest rates. As a result, we may experience exposure to interest rate risk due to the potential volatility associated with the variable interest rates on the term loan. If rates increase, we may be subject to higher costs of servicing the loan which could reduce our profitability and cash flows. During the six months ended March 31, 2019, the weighted average stated interest rate on the term loan was 5.2%. During the six months ended March 31, 2019, we incurred aggregate interest expense of $12.3 million on the term loans. Our debt service requirements are expected to be funded through our existing sources of liquidity and operating cash flows.   
 The term loan agreement and the Amendment contain certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default. As of March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions under the term loan agreement.  
 As of March 31, 2019, we had approximately $51.3 million available for borrowing under the line of credit. There were no amounts outstanding pursuant to the line of credit as of March 31, 2019. The amount of funds available for borrowing under the line of credit arrangement may fluctuate each period based on our borrowing base availability. The line of credit contains certain customary representations and warranties, a financial covenant, affirmative and negative covenants, as well as events of default. We were in compliance with the line of credit covenants as of March 31, 2019. Although we believe we will be able to generate sufficient cash in the United States and foreign jurisdictions to fund future operating costs, we secured the revolving line of credit as an additional assurance for maintaining liquidity in the United States during potentially severe downturns of the cyclical semiconductor market, and for strategic investments or acquisitions.   
 On July 27, 2016, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC to sell securities, including common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, depositary shares, purchase contracts and purchase units in amounts to be determined at the time of an offering. Any such offering, if it does occur, may happen in one or more transactions. The specific terms of any securities to be sold will be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. This registration statement will expire on July 27, 2019.   
 On April 26, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share payable on June 28, 2019 to common stockholders of record as of June 7, 2019. Dividends are declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend on actual cash flow from operations, our financial condition, debt service and capital requirements, and any other factors our Board of Directors may consider relevant. We intend to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future; however, the amount and timing of these dividends may be impacted by the cyclical nature of certain markets we serve. We may reduce, delay or cancel a quarterly cash dividend based on the severity of a cyclical downturn.  
 Our non-cancellable inventory purchase commitments were $88.3 million at March 31, 2019.   
 At March 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.3 million of letters of credit outstanding related primarily to customer advances and other performance obligations. These arrangements guarantee the refund of advance payments received from our customers in the event that the product is not delivered or warranty obligations are not fulfilled in accordance with the contract terms. These obligations could be called by the beneficiaries at any time before the expiration date of the particular letter of credit if we fail to meet certain contractual requirements. None of these obligations were called during the six months ended March 31, 2019, and we currently do not anticipate any of these obligations to be called in the near future.  
 As of March 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.  
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
