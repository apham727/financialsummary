 You should read the MD&A in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical information, the MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read “Information Related to Forward-Looking Statements” below for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations.  
 We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by tax-paying component and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an annual and quarterly basis. We evaluate the profitability of each tax-paying component on a historic cumulative basis and a forward-looking basis while performing this analysis. We evaluated all positive and negative evidence in concluding it was appropriate to release the majority of the valuation allowance against U.S. net deferred tax assets during fiscal year 2018. The remaining portion of our U.S. valuation allowance is related to the realizability of certain state tax credits and net operating loss carry-forwards. We continue to maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in certain foreign tax-paying components as of March 31, 2019.
