Overview



We are a FORTUNE 500® science, engineering and information technology company that provides services and solutions in the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets.
We bring domain-specific capability and cross-market innovations to customers in each of these markets by leveraging seven core capabilities: cyber; digital modernization; integrated systems; mission software systems; mission support; operations and logistics; and sensors, collection and phenomenology.
Our domestic customers include the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs and many other U.S. government civilian agencies, as well as state and local government agencies.
We operate in three reportable segments: Defense Solutions, Civil and Health.
Additionally, we separately present the costs associated with corporate functions as Corporate.
Effective the beginning of fiscal 2019, we changed the composition of our Defense Solutions reportable segment to better align the operations within the reportable segment to the customers we serve.
This resulted in the identification of new operating segments within Defense Solutions.
In addition, certain contracts were reassigned between the Civil and Defense Solutions reportable segments.
While this activity did not have a material impact on the Company's reportable segments, prior year segments results have been recast to reflect this change.
In September 2018, Congress passed and the President signed a consolidated appropriations bill funding the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Health and Human Services for the full government fiscal year ("GFY") 2019.
Earlier in 2018, funding for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Energy as well as funding for Congress were also enacted.
All were funded at increased levels from the previous year.
The remaining seven appropriations bills were operating under a continuing resolution ("CR") until it expired on December 21, 2018.
From the expiration of that CR until the passage of a new CR on January 25, 2019 there was a partial U.S. government shutdown, which reduced or delayed work on existing contracts and caused delays in other government contracting actions and payments.
Prior to the expiration of the January CR, Congress passed appropriations for the seven remaining appropriations bills, thereby completing funding for GFY 2019.
In March 2019, the President submitted the GFY 2020 budget proposal to Congress.
The budget includes $750 billion for defense and $563 billion for non-defense spending.
The defense budget proposal includes $576 billion for national defense and $165 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations fund.

On July 22, 2019, the White House and Congress reached a tentative two-year budget deal to raise spending caps and suspend the debt ceiling until July 2021.
Under the deal, allocations for national defense spending increases to $738 billion in GFY 2020 and to $741 billion in GFY 2021.
For non-defense programs, spending increases to $632 billion in GFY 2020 and $635 billion in GFY 2021.
Overall, the measure increases spending by $323 billion over the limits set under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.
Congress is now addressing the passage of the appropriations bills for GFY 2020.

Results of Operations



The following table summarizes our condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods presented:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The increase in revenues in constant currency(1) for the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, was 8.4% and 7.2%, as compared to an actual increase in revenues of 7.9% and 6.7%, respectively.
The foreign currency impact was mainly attributable to adverse exchange rate movements in the British pound and Australian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________



(1) The non-GAAP measure of constant currency revenues is used to assess the performance of revenue activity without the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
We calculate revenues on a constant currency basis by translating current period revenue using the foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year periods.
This calculation is performed for all subsidiaries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.
The increase in revenues for the six months ended June 28, 2019, as compared to the six months ended June 29, 2018, was primarily attributable to new awards and a net increase in program volumes, partially offset by the completion of certain contracts, lower net profit write-ups in the current year and adverse exchange rate movements in the Australian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar.
The increase in operating income for the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, as compared to the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, was primarily due to new awards, partially offset by lower net profit write-ups in the current year.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The decrease in operating loss for the six months ended June 28, 2019, as compared to the six months ended June 29, 2018, was primarily attributable to lower integration and restructuring costs and an asset impairment charge in the prior year.
Non-Operating (Expense) Income, net



Non-operating expense, net of $31 million for the three months ended June 28, 2019 was consistent with the non-operating expense, net of $34 million for the three months ended June 29, 2018.
Non-operating income, net for the six months ended June 28, 2019 was $23 million as compared to non-operating expense, net of $68 million for the six months ended June 29, 2018.

Provision for Income Taxes



For the three months ended June 28, 2019, our effective tax rate was 22.9% compared to 12.1% for the three months ended June 29, 2018.
The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits recognized during the three months ended June 29, 2018, related to the anticipated sale of our commercial cybersecurity business.
For the six months ended June 28, 2019, our effective tax rate was 23.1% compared to 14.8% for the six months ended June 29, 2018.
Bookings and Backlog

Summary of Cash Flows



 The following table summarizes cash flow information for the periods presented:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $85 million for the three months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to less favorable timing of working capital changes and higher tax payments.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $181 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher advance payments from customers, $24 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition and lower payments for integration and restructuring costs, partially offset by higher payments for taxes and timing of interest payments.
Net cash provided by investing activities increased $330 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year, primarily due to proceeds of $267 million received for the disposition of our commercial cybersecurity business and sale of real estate properties and $81 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition, partially offset by higher purchases of equipment and software.
Net cash used in financing activities decreased $128 million for the three months ended June 28, 2019, when compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to $90 million of stock repurchases in the prior year quarter and $23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year quarter.
