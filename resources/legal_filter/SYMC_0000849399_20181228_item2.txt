Key financial metrics



The following tables provide our key financial metrics for the periods presented:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Below are our financial highlights for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year: 



•Net revenues were relatively flat compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, as increases in revenue from our identity and information protection solutions and from the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard were partially offset by a decrease as a result of the divestiture of our website security (“WSS”) and public key infrastructure (“PKI”) solutions in October 2017.
•Net income and diluted net income per share decreased primarily due to the absence of a gain on the divestiture of our WSS and PKI solutions and a net income tax benefit as a result of the Act, both of which were recorded in our third quarter of fiscal 2018.
29

Below are our financial highlights for the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to the corresponding period in the prior year unless stated otherwise: 



•Net revenues decreased 2% primarily as a result of the divestiture of our WSS and PKI solutions, partially offset by an increase in revenue from our identity and information protection solutions.
•Operating income increased $230 million primarily due to increased revenue from our identity and information protection solutions and lower stock-based compensation, partially offset by the negative impact to Enterprise Security Segment operating income due to the fiscal 2018 divestiture of WSS and PKI solutions.
•Net income and diluted net income per share decreased primarily due to the absence of a gain on the divestiture of WSS and PKI solutions and a net income tax benefit as a result of the Act, which both were recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
•Cash flow from operating activities increased $264 million due to higher net income adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by unfavorable net changes in operating assets and liabilities.
•Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $417 million compared to March 30, 2018, primarily due to cash provided by operations, partially offset by investing and financing activities, consisting primarily of additions to property and equipment, tax payments related to restricted stock units and payments of dividend and dividend equivalents.
•Contract liabilities decreased $188 million compared to March 30, 2018, primarily due to a decrease of $169 million in the March 30, 2018 balances as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
We evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly.
Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates.
There have been no material changes in the matters for which we make critical accounting estimates in the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements during the nine months ended December 28, 2018, except for changes as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.
Revenue recognition



We recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements under the authoritative guidance on contracts with customers.
Revenue recognition requirements are very complex and require us to make estimates and assumptions.
We enter into arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which may include hardware, software licenses, cloud services, support and maintenance, and professional services.
We allocate revenue to each performance obligation on a relative fair value basis based on management’s estimate of stand-alone selling price (“SSP”).
Judgments are required to determine the SSP for each performance obligation.
The determination of SSP is made by taking into consideration observable prices in historical transactions.
Changes to the performance obligations in an arrangement, the judgments required to estimate the SSP for the respective performance obligations, and increasing variability in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Three Months Ended December 28, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended December 29, 2017 



Non-operating income (expense), net, decreased by $681 million primarily due to the absence of the fiscal 2018 $658 million gain on the divestiture of our WSS and PKI solutions.

In addition, in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we incurred an $84 million loss from our equity interest discussed above, partially offset by a $42 million decrease in interest expense as a result of lower outstanding borrowings due to repayments during fiscal 2018.
Any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict.
Segment operating results



We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses that we manage separately at the corporate level and are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments.

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND CASH REQUIREMENTS 



Liquidity



We have historically relied on cash generated from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, issuances of debt, and proceeds from divestitures for our liquidity needs.
As of December 28, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.6 billion, of which $364 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed with the objective to preserve principal, maintain liquidity, and generate investment returns.
We also have an undrawn credit facility of $1.0 billion which expires in May 2021.
Our principal cash requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support on-going business activities, including the payment of taxes, fund capital expenditures, service existing debt, and invest in business acquisitions.
As a part of our plan to deleverage our balance sheet, we may from time to time make optional repayments of our debt obligations, which may include repurchases of our outstanding debt, depending on various factors such as market conditions.
Historically this has included a quarterly cash dividend, the repayment of debt and the repurchase of our common stock.
Cash flows



The following summarizes our cash flow activities:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Cash from operating activities



Our cash flows for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 reflected a net loss of $3 million adjusted by non-cash items, including amortization and depreciation of $457 million, and stock-based compensation of $265 million, compared to a net income of $1.2 billion adjusted by non-cash items, including amortization and depreciation of $485 million, and stock-based compensation of $448 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
Changes in operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of a decrease of $97 million in accounts receivable in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, reflecting higher collections versus billings.
Cash from investing activities



Our investing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 included capital expenditures of $153 million and payments for acquisitions of $41 million, net of cash acquired, partially offset by cash proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments of $119 million, while our investing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 consisted of net cash proceeds of $946 million from the divestiture of our WSS and PKI solutions in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of $408 million, net cash payments of $402 million for acquisitions, primarily related to the acquisitions of Fireglass Ltd. and Skycure Ltd. and capital expenditures of $105 million.
Cash from financing activities



Our financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 primarily consisted of tax withholding payments related to RSUs of $168 million and payment of dividends and dividend equivalents of $169 million, compared to $97 million and $163 million, respectively, in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
In addition, we repaid debt of $2.6 billion and received net proceeds from sales of common stock under employee stock incentive plans of $83 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.

Cash requirements



Debt - As of December 28, 2018, our total outstanding principal amount of indebtedness was $5.1 billion, of which $600 million in principal is payable in the next twelve months, summarized as follows.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Prior to the end of fiscal 2019, we plan to prepay our $600 million Senior Term Loan A-2 due August 1, 2019.
Debt covenant compliance.
The Senior Term Loan agreements A-2, A-5 and our revolving credit facility contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including compliance with specified financial ratios, non-financial covenants for financial reporting, and restrictions on subsidiary indebtedness, liens, stock repurchases and dividends (with exceptions permitting our regular quarterly dividend).
Our Convertible Senior Notes agreements and the agreement for our 5.0% Senior Note due April 15, 2025 also require us to file periodic reports with the SEC by specified deadlines.
As of December 28, 2018, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.
Dividends.
On January 31, 2019, we announced a cash dividend of $0.075 per share of common stock to be paid in March 2019.
Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.
Stock repurchases.
Under our stock repurchase program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through accelerated stock repurchase transactions, open market transactions (including through trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act) and privately-negotiated transactions.
As of December 28, 2018, the remaining balance of our stock repurchase authorization was $800 million.
In January 2019, our Board of Directors approved an increase or $500 million to our program, resulting in aggregate authorization of $1.3 billion with no fixed expiration date.
We plan to initiate stock repurchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
Contractual obligations



The following is a schedule of our significant contractual obligations as of December 28, 2018:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(2)These amounts are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
The table above also includes agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment.
The amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely, and we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials.
(3)These amounts represent the transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the Act which may be paid in installments through July 2025.
(4)We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements that expire on various dates through fiscal 2029.
The amounts in the table above exclude expected sublease income.
Therefore, $325 million in long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the contractual obligations table.
See Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
See Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our indemnifications.
