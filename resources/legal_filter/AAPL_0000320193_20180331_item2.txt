On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”).
The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014.
Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward.
The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union.
Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision.
Although Ireland is still computing the recovery amount, the Company expects the amount to be in line with the European Commission’s announced recovery amount of €13 billion, plus interest of €1 billion.
During the third quarter of 2018, the Company expects to begin funding amounts into escrow, where they will remain pending conclusion of all appeals.
