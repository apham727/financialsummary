 Item 2.
The MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and accompanying Notes included in Item 1.
"Risk Factors," filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 15, 2019.
Overview 



Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (“Vishay,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors and passive components, including power MOSFETs, power integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, optoelectronic components, resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
Discrete semiconductors and passive components manufactured by Vishay are used in virtually all types of electronic products, including those in the industrial, computing, automotive, consumer electronic products, telecommunications, power supplies, military/aerospace, and medical industries.
We operate in five product segments: MOSFETs; Diodes; Optoelectronic Components; Resistors & Inductors; and Capacitors.
Since 1985, we have pursued a business strategy of growth through focused research and development and acquisitions.
Through this strategy, we have grown to become one of the world’s largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors and passive components.
We expect to continue our strategy of acquisitions while also maintaining a prudent capital structure.
We are focused on enhancing stockholder value and improving earnings per share.
In 2014, our Board of Directors instituted a quarterly dividend payment program and declared the first cash dividend in the history of Vishay.
We have paid dividends each quarter since the first fiscal quarter of 2014, and increased the quarterly cash dividend by 26% to $0.085 per share in the second fiscal quarter of 2018.
On May 8, 2019, we announced that the quarterly cash dividend was further increased by 12% to $0.095 per share.
During 2018 we reacted quickly to the opportunities created by the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) in December 2017.
In June 2018, we used the net proceeds from issuing $600 million principal amount of new convertible senior notes to repurchase some of our outstanding convertible senior debentures, which had become less tax-efficient because of the TCJA.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, we utilized repatriated cash to repurchase additional convertible senior debentures in open market and privately-negotiated transactions with holders.
As a result of these transactions, we reduced the principal amount of outstanding convertible senior debentures due 2040, 2041, and 2042 from $575 million to $36.6 million.
During the first quarter of 2019, we continued to repurchase convertible senior debentures in open market and privately-negotiated transactions with holders, further reducing the principal amount of outstanding convertible senior debentures to $21.1 million.
For several years, we implemented aggressive cost reduction programs.
Additionally, we continue to closely monitor our costs, inventory, and capital resources to respond to changing conditions and to ensure we have the management, business processes, and resources to meet our future needs.
We utilize several financial metrics, including net revenues, gross profit margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, change in average selling prices, net cash and short-term investments (debt), and free cash generation to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business.
See further discussion in “Financial Metrics” and “Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources” below.
Net revenues increased versus the prior year quarter, but decreased versus the prior fiscal quarter.
There is a substantial increase of inventory in the supply chain, which has negatively impacted several key financial metrics.
29 



Net revenues for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 were $745.2 million, compared to $775.9 million and $716.8 million for the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
The net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 were $75.5 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to $102.4 million, or $0.69 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018, and $62.4 million, or $0.39 per diluted share for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.
We define adjusted net earnings as net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP adjusted for various items that management believes are not indicative of the intrinsic operating performance of our business.
We define free cash as the cash flows generated from continuing operations less capital expenditures plus net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.
The reconciliations below include certain financial measures which are not recognized in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash.
These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity.
Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash do not have uniform definitions.
These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Management believes that adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share are meaningful because they provide insight with respect to our intrinsic operating results.
Management believes that free cash is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends.
Net earnings attributable to Vishay stockholders for the fiscal quarters ended March 30, 2019, December 31, 2018, and March 31, 2018 include items affecting comparability.
The items affecting comparability are (in thousands, except per share amounts): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Although the term "free cash" is not defined in GAAP, each of the elements used to calculate free cash for the year-to-date period is presented as a line item on the face of our consolidated condensed statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP and the quarterly amounts are derived from the year-to-date GAAP statements as of the beginning and end of the respective quarter.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Our results for the fiscal quarters ended March 30, 2019, December 31, 2018, and March 31, 2018 represent the effects of a strong business environment, our cost reduction programs, and our organic growth initiatives.
We experienced a relatively sharp upturn in demand beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 that continued through first nine fiscal months of 2018.
We began to experience a normalization of demand in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, which continued in the first fiscal quarter of 2019 as supply, in general, caught up with demand.
These key financial measures and metrics include net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, segment operating income, end-of-period backlog, and the book-to-bill ratio.
Gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of net revenues.
Operating margin is computed as gross profit less operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues.
We evaluate business segment performance on segment operating margin.
Segment operating margin is computed as operating income less items such as restructuring and severance costs, asset write-downs, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments, inventory write-downs, gains or losses on purchase commitments, global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administrative groups, and other items, expressed as a percentage of net revenues.
We believe that evaluating segment performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the segment.
End-of-period backlog is one indicator of future revenues.
We include in our backlog only open orders that we expect to ship in the next twelve months.
Therefore, the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.
A book-to-bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our backlog is building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods.
Conversely, a book-to-bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining revenues.
We focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory.
We define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our costs of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory (computed using each fiscal quarter-end balance) for this same period.
A higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital.
The erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical for semiconductor products.
Our specialty passive components are more resistant to average selling price erosion.
31 



The quarter-to-quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business.
The following table shows net revenues, gross profit margin, operating margin, end-of-period backlog, book-to-bill ratio, inventory turnover, and changes in ASP for our business as a whole during the five fiscal quarters beginning with the first fiscal quarter of 2018 through the first fiscal quarter of 2019 (dollars in thousands): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



See “Financial Metrics by Segment” below for net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, and gross profit margin broken out by segment.
Revenues decreased versus the prior fiscal quarter, but increased versus the first fiscal quarter of 2018.
Distributors, particularly of semiconductor products in Asia, began to normalize their backlogs in the third fiscal quarter of 2018 and we experienced a further normalization of demand through the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 and first fiscal quarter of 2019 as supply, in general, has caught up with demand.
Average selling prices have remained relatively stable.
Gross profit margin was stable versus the prior fiscal quarter, but decreased versus the first fiscal quarter of 2018.
The decrease versus the first fiscal quarter of 2018 is primarily volume-driven.
U.S. tariffs on goods imported from China impacted the gross profit margin versus both the prior fiscal quarter and first fiscal quarter of 2018.
The book-to-bill ratio in the first fiscal quarter of 2019 decreased to 0.79 versus 0.94 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018.
The book-to-bill ratios in the first fiscal quarter of 2019 for distributors and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") were 0.54 and 1.10, respectively, versus ratios of 0.90 and 0.98, respectively, during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018.
For the second fiscal quarter of 2019, we anticipate revenues between $700 million and $740 million and gross margins of 26% to 27% at the exchange rates of the first fiscal quarter of 2019.

Financial Metrics by Segment 



The following table shows net revenues, book-to-bill ratio, gross profit margin, and segment operating margin broken out by segment for the five fiscal quarters beginning with the first fiscal quarter of 2018 through the first fiscal quarter of 2019 (dollars in thousands): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



33 



Acquisition Activity 



As part of our growth strategy, we seek to expand through targeted acquisitions of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets, reputations for product quality and reliability, and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise.
Acquisitions of passive components businesses would likely be made to strengthen and broaden our position as a specialty product supplier; acquisitions of discrete semiconductor businesses would be made to increase market share and to generate synergies.
For these purposes, we calculate pro forma EBITDA as the adjusted EBITDA of Vishay and the target for Vishay’s four preceding fiscal quarters, with a pro forma adjustment for savings which management estimates would have been achieved had the target been acquired by Vishay at the beginning of the four fiscal quarter period.
On January 3, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Bi-Metallix, Inc. ("Bi-Metallix"), a U.S.-based, privately-held provider of electron beam continuous strip welding services for $11.9 million.
We were a major customer of Bi-Metallix, and the acquired business will be vertically integrated into our Resistors & Inductors segment.
The results and operations of this acquisition have been included in the Resistors & Inductors segment since January 3, 2019.
Bi-Metallix did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019.
34 



Cost Management 



We place a strong emphasis on controlling our costs, and use various measures and metrics to evaluate our cost structure.
We define variable costs as expenses that vary with respect to quantity produced.
Fixed costs do not vary with respect to quantity produced over the relevant time period.
Contributive margin is calculated as net revenue less variable costs.
It may be expressed in dollars or as a percentage of net revenue.
Management uses this measure to determine the amount of profit to be expected for any change in revenues.
While these measures are typical cost accounting measures, none of these measures are recognized in accordance with GAAP.
The classification of expenses as either variable or fixed is judgmental and other companies might classify such expenses differently.
These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
We closely monitor variable costs and seek to achieve the contributive margin in our business model.
Over a period of many years, we have generally maintained a contributive margin of between 45% - 47% of revenues.
Historically, our primary cost reduction technique was through the transfer of production to the extent possible from high-labor-cost countries to lower-labor-cost countries.
We do not anticipate any material restructuring activities in 2019.
We continue to pursue our growth plans through investing in capacities for strategic product lines, and through increasing our resources for R&D, technical marketing, and field application engineering; supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions of specialty businesses.
35 



Foreign Currency Translation 



We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly due to transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries.
We occasionally use forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of these exposures.
GAAP requires that we identify the “functional currency” of each of our subsidiaries and measure all elements of the financial statements in that functional currency.
A subsidiary’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
In cases where a subsidiary is relatively self-contained within a particular country, the local currency is generally deemed to be the functional currency.
However, a foreign subsidiary that is a direct and integral component or extension of the parent company’s operations generally would have the parent company’s currency as its functional currency.
We have both situations among our subsidiaries.
Foreign Subsidiaries which use the Local Currency as the Functional Currency 



We finance our operations in Europe and certain locations in Asia in local currencies, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency.
For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities in the consolidated condensed balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date.
Translation adjustments do not impact the results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, revenues and expenses incurred in the local currency are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
The dollar generally was stronger during the first fiscal quarter compared to the prior year quarter and prior fiscal quarter, with the translation of foreign currency revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars decreasing reported revenues and expenses versus the prior year quarter and prior fiscal quarter.
Foreign Subsidiaries which use the U.S. Dollar as the Functional Currency 



Our operations in Israel and most significant locations in Asia are largely financed in U.S. dollars, and accordingly, these subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
For those foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars.
Exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the results of operations.
While these subsidiaries transact most business in U.S. dollars, they may have significant costs, particularly payroll-related, which are incurred in the local currency.
The cost of products sold for the first fiscal quarter of 2019 have been favorably impacted compared to the prior year quarter, but unfavorably impacted compared to the prior fiscal quarter by local currency transactions of subsidiaries which use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Net Revenues 



Net revenues were as follows (dollars in thousands): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The change in net revenues versus the comparable prior periods was as follows (dollars in thousands): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Changes in net revenues were attributable to the following: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



We experienced a substantial, broad-based increase in demand for our products beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 that continued through the third fiscal quarter of 2018, which resulted in increased net revenues compared to the first fiscal quarter of 2018.
Demand started to decrease as supply started to catch up with demand in fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 and further decreased in the first fiscal quarter of 2019 as supply, in general, caught up with market demand.
The decrease in demand resulted in decreased net revenues compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018.
Gross Profit Margins 



Gross profit margins for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 were 28.3%, versus 28.3% and 28.6% for the comparable prior fiscal quarter and prior year period, respectively.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Changes in Resistors & Inductors segment net revenues were attributable to the following: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Net revenues of the Resistors & Inductors segment for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 decreased slightly versus the prior fiscal quarter, but increased significantly versus the prior year quarter.
The increase in net revenues from the European region versus the prior fiscal quarter was offset by decreases from the Asia and American regions.
Increases in net revenues from the European and American regions versus the prior year quarter were only partially offset by decreases from the Asia region.
The decrease in net revenues versus the prior fiscal quarter is primarily due to distribution customers.
Distribution and the industrial and automotive end markets contributed the most to the revenue increase versus the prior year quarter.
The gross profit margin improved versus the prior fiscal quarter and the prior year quarter.
The increase versus the prior fiscal quarter is primarily due to cost reduction activities.
Due to the strong business environment throughout 2018, average selling prices increased through the first nine fiscal months of 2018 before starting to decrease consistent with our historical experience in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018.
This resulted in average selling prices that were slightly lower versus the prior fiscal quarter and slightly higher versus the prior year quarter.
Capital spending projects continue for strategic product lines.

Distribution customers contributed the most to the revenue increase versus the prior year quarter.
The gross profit margin in the first fiscal quarter of 2019 increased versus the prior fiscal quarter and the prior year quarter.
The increase versus the prior fiscal quarter is primarily due to a more favorable product mix and higher average selling prices.
The increase versus the prior year quarter is primarily due to increased sales volume and higher average selling prices.
Due to the positive business climate, average selling prices increased slightly versus the prior fiscal quarter and prior year quarter.
42 



Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 



Selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The overall increase in SG&A expenses is primarily attributable to general salary and cost inflation.
Compared to the prior year quarter, the increase also reflects the costs of acquisitions and higher R&D costs, partially offset by lower amortization expense.
Certain items included in SG&A expenses impact the comparability of these amounts, as summarized below (in thousands): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Certain intangible assets became fully amortized in the third fiscal quarter of 2018.
Other Income (Expense) 



Interest expense for the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019 decreased by $1.4 million versus the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018 and increased by $0.7 million versus the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.
The decrease versus the prior fiscal quarter is primarily due to reduced interest expense on the revolving credit facility and convertible senior debentures as a result of using cash repatriated in 2018 to reduce the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility and to repurchase convertible senior debentures.
The increase versus the prior year quarter is primarily attributable to the issuance of convertible senior notes due 2025 in the second fiscal quarter of 2018, partially offset by the effects of convertible senior debenture repurchases.
The following tables analyze the components of the line “Other” on the consolidated condensed statements of operations (in thousands):

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



43 



Income Taxes 



For the fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2019, our effective tax rate was 24.3%, as compared to -2.3% and 32.0% for the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
These types of remeasurement adjustments will continue until the amounts are repatriated.
The effective tax rate for the fiscal quarters ended March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was also impacted by the effect of the repurchase of convertible senior debentures.
We recognized a tax benefit of $1.3 million and $20.9 million in the fiscal quarters ended March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, resulting from the extinguishments, reflecting the reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the special tax attributes of the debentures.
During the three fiscal months ended March 30, 2019, the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits increased by $1.4 million on a net basis, due to increases for tax positions taken in the current and prior periods and interest, offset by expiration of a statute.
Part of our historical strategy has been to achieve cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to countries where we can take advantage of lower labor costs and available tax and other government-sponsored incentives.
Accordingly, our effective tax rate has historically been less than the U.S. statutory rate, except in years where there are material discrete items.

Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources 



We focus on our ability to generate cash flows from operations.
The cash generated from operations is used to fund our capital expenditure plans, and cash in excess of our capital expenditure needs is available to fund our acquisition strategy, to reduce debt levels, and to pay dividends and repurchase stock.
We have generated cash flows from operations in excess of $200 million in each of the last 17 years, and cash flows from operations in excess of $100 million in each of the last 24 years.
Management uses a non-GAAP measure, "free cash," to evaluate our ability to fund acquisitions, repay debt, and otherwise enhance stockholder value through stock repurchases or dividends.
See "Overview" above for "free cash" definition and reconciliation to GAAP.
Vishay has generated positive "free cash" in each of the past 22 years, and "free cash" in excess of $80 million in each of the last 17 years.
In this volatile economic environment, we continue to focus on the generation of free cash, including an emphasis on cost controls.
The payment of these cash taxes was recorded as an operating cash flow and any future cash taxes associated with the TCJA transition tax and related foreign taxes on repatriated cash will generally be recorded as operating cash flows.
The payment of these cash taxes significantly impacted cash flows from operations and free cash for the year ended December 31, 2018.
We maintain a revolving credit facility, first entered into in 2010, which was amended and restated on August 8, 2013, and further amended and restated on December 10, 2015.
The credit facility provides an aggregate commitment of $640 million of revolving loans available until December 10, 2020, and we have the ability to request up to $50 million of incremental revolving commitments, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
At March 30, 2019, no amounts are outstanding under our credit facility.
The credit facility allows an unlimited amount of defined "Restricted Payments," which include cash dividends to stockholders and share repurchases, provided our pro forma leverage ratio is less than 2.25 to 1.
If our leverage ratio is greater than 2.25 to 1, the credit facility allows such payments up to $75 million per annum (subject to a cap of $225 million for the term of the facility).
Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin.
The applicable interest margin is based on our leverage ratio.
The interest rate on any borrowings increases to LIBOR plus 1.75% if our leverage ratio is between 1.50 to 1 and 2.50 to 1 and further increases to 2.00% if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1.
Based on our leverage ratio as of the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2019, any new borrowings in the second fiscal quarter of 2019 will bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%.
The undrawn commitment fee, based on our leverage ratio for the first fiscal quarter of 2019, was 0.30% per annum.
Such undrawn commitment fee increases to 0.35% per annum if our leverage ratio is between 1.50 to 1 and 2.50 to 1 and further increases to 0.40% per annum if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 2.50 to 1.
Based on our leverage ratio as of the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2019, our undrawn commitment fee in the second fiscal quarter of 2019 will be 0.30% per annum.
Certain of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow under the credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions.
Any borrowings by these subsidiaries under the credit facility will be guaranteed by Vishay and certain subsidiaries.
The financial maintenance covenants include (a) an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1; and (b) a leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1 (and a pro forma ratio of 2.75 to 1 on the date of incurrence of additional debt).
The computation of these ratios is prescribed in Article VI of the Credit Agreement between Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which has been filed with the SEC as Exhibit 10.1 to our current report on Form 8-K filed December 10, 2015.
45 



We were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit facility at March 30, 2019.
Our interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio were 19.33 to 1 and 0.96 to 1, respectively.
We expect to continue to be in compliance with these covenants based on current projections.
If we are not in compliance with all of the required financial covenants, the credit facility could be terminated by the lenders, and any amounts then outstanding pursuant to the credit facility could become immediately payable.
Additionally, our convertible senior debentures due 2040 and due 2041 and our convertible senior notes due 2025 have cross-default provisions that could accelerate repayment in the event the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated.
We had no amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2018.
We had no borrowings or repayments on our credit facility during the three fiscal months ended March 30, 2019.
During 2018, we issued $600 million principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior notes due 2025 to qualified institutional investors and repatriated approximately $724 million to the United States.
We used substantially all of the proceeds from the issuance and the repatriated amounts to reduce the outstanding balance of the credit facility to zero, to repay certain intercompany indebtedness, and to fund our 2018 repurchases of convertible senior debentures.
During the first fiscal quarter of 2019, we repurchased $1.0 million, $12.3 million, and the remaining $2.2 million principal amount of convertible senior debentures due 2040, due 2041, and due 2042, respectively, for $22.7 million.
We used cash on hand, primarily repatriated cash, to fund the repurchases.
After completing the 2018 phases of cash repatriation, there is approximately $300 million of unremitted foreign earnings that we have deemed not permanently reinvested and thus have accrued foreign withholding and other taxes.
Our substantially undrawn credit facility provides us with significant operating liquidity in the United States.
We expect to fund any future repurchases of convertible debentures, as well as other obligations required to be paid by the U.S. parent company, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc., including cash dividends to stockholders, share repurchases, and principal and interest payments on our debt instruments by borrowing under our revolving credit facility.
Our U.S. subsidiaries also have operating cash needs.
Although we do not currently have any amounts outstanding on the revolving credit facility, management expects to use the credit facility from time-to-time to meet certain short-term financing needs.
We expect that cash on-hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our longer-term financing needs related to normal operating requirements, regular dividend payments, and our research and development and capital expenditure plans.
Additional acquisition activity, share repurchases, convertible debt repurchases, or conversion of our convertible debentures may require additional borrowing under our credit facility or may otherwise require us to incur additional debt.
No principal payments on our debt are due before the maturity of our revolving credit facility in December 2020.
Prior to three months before the maturity date, our convertible senior debentures are convertible by the holders under certain circumstances.
The convertible debentures due 2040 became convertible subsequent to the September 30, 2017 evaluation of the conversion criteria, and have remained convertible for each subsequent quarterly evaluation through the March 30, 2019 evaluation, due to the sale price of our common stock exceeding 130% of the conversion price for the applicable periods.
Such debentures will remain convertible until June 29, 2019, at which time the conversion criteria will be reevaluated.
At the direction of our Board of Directors, we intend, upon conversion, to repay the principal amount of the any convertible debt instruments in cash and settle any additional amounts in shares of our common stock.
We intend to finance the principal amount of any converted debentures using borrowings under our credit facility.
Accordingly, the debt component of the convertible senior debentures due 2040 continues to be classified as a noncurrent liability on the consolidated condensed balance sheets.
No conversions have occurred to date.
The convertible senior debentures due 2041 and the convertible senior notes due 2025 are not currently convertible.

We invest a portion of our excess cash in highly liquid, high-quality instruments with maturities greater than 90 days, but less than 1 year, which we classify as short-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets.
As these investments were funded using a portion of excess cash and represent a significant aspect of our cash management strategy, we include the investments in the calculation of net cash and short-term investments (debt).
The interest rates on our short-term investments vary by location, but can be up to 150 bps higher than the interest rates on our cash accounts.
The average interest rate on our short-term investments was 1.4% due to the low interest rate environment in Europe.
Transactions related to these investments are classified as investing activities on our consolidated condensed statements of cash flows.
The following table summarizes the components of net cash and short-term investments (debt) at March 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 (in thousands):
