We use analytics to help businesses automate, improve and connect decisions across their enterprise — an approach we commonly refer to as decision management. Our predictive analytics, which includes the industry-standard FICO® Score, and our decision management systems leverage the use of big data and mathematical algorithms to predict, categorize, and describe consumer behavior in order to power hundreds of billions of customer decisions each year. We help thousands of companies in over 100 countries use our decision management technology to target and acquire customers more efficiently, increase customer value, detect and reduce fraud and credit losses, lower operating expenses, and enter new markets more profitably. Most leading banks and credit card issuers rely on our solutions, as do insurers, retailers, telecommunications providers, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare organizations, public agencies and organizations in other industries. We also serve consumers through online services that enable people to purchase and understand their FICO® Scores, the standard measure of consumer credit risk in the U.S., and empower them to manage their financial health. Most of our solutions address customer engagement, including customer acquisition, customer onboarding, customer servicing and management, and customer protection. We also help businesses improve non-customer decisions such as streamlining transaction and claims processing, optimizing logistics, and identifying and quantifying security risk. Our solutions enable users to make decisions that are more precise, consistent and agile, and that systematically advance business goals. This helps our clients to reduce the cost of doing business, increase revenues and profitability, reduce losses from risks and fraud, and increase customer loyalty.
We derive a significant portion of our revenues from clients outside the U.S. International revenues accounted for 31% and 33% of total consolidated revenues for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 34% of total consolidated revenues for each of the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.

Transactional and Maintenance Bookings
•Individual performance of our customers relative to their competitors; and
We calculate maintenance bookings directly from the terms stated in the contract.
We calculate professional services bookings as the estimated number of hours to complete a project multiplied by the rate per hour. We estimate the number of hours based on our understanding of the project scope, conversations with customer personnel and our experience in estimating professional services projects. Estimated bookings may differ from actual results primarily due to differences in the actual number of hours incurred. These differences typically result from customer decisions to alter the mix of FICO and customer services resources used to complete a project.
License Bookings
Licenses are sold on a perpetual or term basis and bookings generally equal the fixed amount stated in the contract.
Bookings Trend Analysis
Transactional and maintenance bookings were 35% and 46% of total bookings for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Professional services bookings were 51% and 41% of total bookings for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Outlook
Summary of Cash Flows 
Our primary method for funding operations and growth has been through cash flows generated from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $96.6 million during the six months ended March 31, 2019 from $78.0 million during the six months ended March 31, 2018. The $18.6 million increase was mainly attributable to a $9.3 million increase in net income, a $6.6 million increase in non-cash share-based compensation expense and a $3.2 million increase in deferred income taxes.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities decreased to $12.8 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019 from $13.3 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018. The $0.5 million decrease was attributable to a decrease in purchases of property and equipment.
Net cash used in financing activities increased to $97.3 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019 from $64.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018. The $32.6 million increase was primarily attributable to a $41.0 million decrease in proceeds, net of payments, from our revolving line of credit and an $8.0 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by an $11.1 million increase in proceeds from issuance of treasury stock under employee stock plans and a $5.0 million decrease in repurchases of common stock.
In July 2018, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program following the completion of our previous program. This program was open-ended and authorized repurchases of shares of our common stock up to an aggregate cost of $250.0 million in the open market or in negotiated transactions.
Pursuant to the July 2018 program, we repurchased 150,000 shares of our common stock at a total repurchase price of $37.0 million and 575,000 shares of our common stock at a total repurchase price of $119.7 million during the quarter and six months ended March 31, 2019, respectively.
On July 14, 2010, we issued $245 million of senior notes in a private placement to a group of institutional investors (the “2010 Senior Notes”). The 2010 Senior Notes were issued in four series with maturities ranging from 6 to 10 years. The outstanding 2010 Senior Notes’ weighted average interest rate is 5.6% and the weighted average maturity is 9.8 years. The 2010 Senior Notes require interest payments semi-annually and contain certain restrictive covenants, including the maintenance of a maximum consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 3.00 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.50. On May 8, 2018, we issued $400 million of senior notes in a private offering to qualified institutional investors (the “2018 Senior Notes”, and with the 2010 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”). The 2018 Senior Notes require interest payments semi-annually at a rate of 5.25% per annum and will mature on 2026-05-15. The purchase agreements for the 2010 Senior Notes and the indenture for the 2018 Senior Notes contain certain covenants typical of unsecured obligations.

Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
See Note 8 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion on revenues.
Business Combinations
Accounting for our acquisitions requires us to recognize, separately from goodwill, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.
