Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate
We have a $400 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a syndicate of banks that expires on May 8, 2023. Proceeds from the credit facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and may also be used for the refinancing of existing debt, acquisitions, and the repurchase of our common stock. Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is based on (i) a base rate, which is the greater of (a) the prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.500% and (c) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.000%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for base rate borrowings ranges from 0% to 0.875% and for LIBOR borrowings ranges from 1.000% to 1.875%, and is determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio. A change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts the interest incurred and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instrument. We had $315.0 million in borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 3.869% under the credit facility as of March 31, 2019.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts
The foreign currency forward contracts were entered into on March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively; therefore, their fair value was $0 on each of these dates.
