We use analytics to help businesses automate, improve and connect decisions across their enterprise, an approach we commonly refer to as decision management. Our predictive analytics, which includes the industry-standard FICO® Score, and our decision management systems leverage the use of big data and mathematical algorithms to predict consumer behavior and power hundreds of billions of customer decisions each year. We help thousands of companies in over 100 countries use our decision management technology to target and acquire customers more efficiently, increase customer value, reduce fraud and credit losses, lower operating expenses, and enter new markets more profitably. Most leading banks and credit card issuers rely on our solutions, as do insurers, retailers, telecommunications providers, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare organizations, public agencies and organizations in other industries. We also serve consumers through online services that enable people to purchase and understand their FICO® Scores, the standard measure of consumer credit risk in the U.S., and empower them to manage their financial health. Most of our solutions address customer engagement, including customer acquisition, customer onboarding, customer servicing and management, and customer protection. We also help businesses improve noncustomer decisions such as transaction and claims processing. Our solutions enable users to make decisions that are more precise, consistent and agile, and that systematically advance business goals. This helps our clients to reduce the cost of doing business, increase revenues and profitability, reduce losses from risks and fraud, and increase customer loyalty.
We derive a significant portion of our revenues from clients outside the U.S. International revenues accounted for 33% and 37% of total consolidated revenues for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 33% and 36% of total consolidated revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A significant portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of products and services within the banking (including consumer credit) industry, and 84% and 72% of our revenues were derived from within this industry during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 84% and 74% of our revenues were derived from within this industry during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, we derive a significant share of revenues from transactional or unit-based software license fees, transactional fees derived under credit scoring, data processing, data management and SaaS subscription services arrangements, and annual software maintenance fees. Arrangements with transactional or unit-based pricing accounted for 76% and 71% of our revenues during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Arrangements with transactional or unit-based pricing accounted for 75% and 70% of our revenues during the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
We continue to drive growth in our Scores segment. Scores revenue increased 34% to $87.9 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $65.4 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, and 26% to 157.8 million during the six months ended March 31, 2018 from 124.8 million during the six months ended March 31, 2017. Scores operating income increased 40% to $71.5 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $50.9 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, and 29% to $125.5 million during the six months ended March 31, 2018 from $97.0 million during the six months ended March 31, 2017. For our Applications and Decision Management Software segments, our cloud business continues to grow both in the absolute dollar value and as a percentage of revenues as we pursue our cloud-first strategy. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, cloud revenues accounted for $63.0 million, or 24% of revenues, compared to $49.8 million, or 22% of revenues during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. During the six months ended March 31, 2018, cloud revenues accounted for $119.5 million, or 24% of revenues, compared to $99.9 million, or 22% of revenues during the six months ended March 31, 2017.
Operating income increased 20% to $48.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $40.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and as a result, net earnings increased 29% to $32.3 million from $25.1 million. Operating income increased 17% to $88.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 from $75.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017, while net earnings decreased 5% to $59.6 million from $63.0 million, primarily due to the income tax expense related to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, partially offset by the increase in operating income.
Transactional and Maintenance Bookings
•Individual performance of our customers relative to their competitors; and
We calculate maintenance bookings directly from the terms stated in the contract.
We calculate professional services bookings as the estimated number of hours to complete a project multiplied by the rate per hour. We estimate the number of hours based on our understanding of the project scope, conversations with customer personnel and our experience in estimating professional services projects. Estimated bookings may differ from actual results primarily due to differences in the actual number of hours incurred. These differences typically result from customer decisions to alter the mix of FICO and customer services resources used to complete a project.
License Bookings
Licenses are sold on a perpetual or term basis and bookings generally equal the fixed amount stated in the contract.
Bookings Trend Analysis
Transactional and maintenance bookings were 46% and 43% of total bookings for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Professional services bookings were 41% and 37% of total bookings for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. License bookings were 13% and 20% of total bookings for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Revenues
Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 Compared to Quarter Ended March 31, 2017 
Applications
Scores segment revenues increased $22.5 million due to an increase of $19.3 million in our business-to-business scores revenue and $3.2 million in our business-to-consumer services revenue. The increase in business-to-business scores was primarily attributable to an increase in transactional scores in originations, primarily driven by higher unit price in mortgage activities. The increase in business-to-consumer services was primarily attributable to an increase in royalties derived from scores sold indirectly to consumers through credit reporting agencies. 
Decision Management Software segment revenues decreased $5.4 million primarily attributable to a decrease in license revenue related to our FICO® Blaze Advisor® product.
Six Months Ended March 31, 2018 Compared to Six Months Ended March 31, 2017 
Applications
Scores segment revenues increased $33.0 million due to an increase of $24.3 million in our business-to-business scores revenue and $8.7 million in our business-to-consumer services revenue. The increase in business-to-business scores was primarily attributable to a $16.8 million increase in transactional scores in originations, primarily driven by higher unit price in mortgage activities; as well as a $6.8 million increase in transactional scores in account management and prescreen, driven by higher transactional volume. The increase in business-to-consumer services was primarily attributable to an increase in royalties derived from scores sold indirectly to consumers through credit reporting agencies. 
Decision Management Software segment revenues decreased $6.8 million primarily attributable to a decrease in license revenue related to our FICO® Blaze Advisor®.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenue expenses increased $6.4 million to $78.5 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $72.1 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a $3.1 million increase in facilities and infrastructure costs, driven by increased resource requirement due to expansion in our cloud infrastructure operations, as well as increased headcount; a $1.6 million increase in personnel and labor costs; and a $1.4 million increase in direct materials cost. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 30% during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, materially consistent with that incurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
Cost of revenues expenses increased $10.8 million to $152.9 million during the six months ended March 31, 2018 from $142.1 million during the six months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a $5.7 million increase in facilities and infrastructure costs and a $3.3 million increase in personnel and labor costs. The increase in facilities and infrastructure costs was primarily attributable to increased resource requirement due to expansion in our cloud infrastructure operations, as well as increased headcount. The increase in personnel and labor costs was primarily attributable to an increase in incentive cost and share-based compensation cost. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 31% during the six months ended March 31, 2018, materially consistent with that incurred during the six months ended March 31, 2017. 
Over the next several quarters, we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will be consistent with that incurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses include personnel and related overhead costs incurred in the development of new products and services, including research of mathematical and statistical models and development of new versions of Applications and Decision Management Software products.
Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 13% during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from 12% during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The $5.9 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in labor and personnel costs as a result of our continued investment in cloud computing and SaaS, as well as other new products. 
Research and development expenses increased $8.7 million to $61.5 million during the six months ended March 31, 2018 from $52.8 million during the six months ended March 31, 2017, primarily attributable to our continued investment in cloud computing and SaaS, as well as other new products. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues was 12% during the six months ended March 31, 2018, consistent with that incurred during the six months ended March 31, 2017.
Over the next several quarters, we expect research and development expenditures as a percentage of revenues will be consistent with that incurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $10.9 million to $97.1 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $86.2 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and labor costs as a result of increased headcount, higher share-based compensation and incentive costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was 37% during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, materially consistent with that incurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $16.0 million to $187.4 million during the six months ended March 31, 2018 from $171.4 million during the six months ended March 31, 2017, primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and labor costs as a result of increased headcount, higher share-based compensation and incentive costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was 38% during the six months ended March 31, 2018, consistent with that incurred during the six months ended March 31, 2017.
Amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting. Our finite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of completed technology and customer contracts and relationships, are being amortized using the straight-line method over periods ranging from four to fifteen years.
The quarter over quarter decrease in amortization expense of $1.6 million was attributable to certain intangible assets associated with our HNC and Adeptra acquisitions becoming fully amortized in August and September 2017, respectively. 
The year-to-date period over period decrease in amortization expense of $3.2 million was attributable to certain intangible assets associated with our HNC and Adeptra acquisitions becoming fully amortized in August and September 2017, respectively. 
Over the next several quarters we expect that amortization expense will be consistent with the amortization expense we recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense includes primarily interest on the senior notes issued in May 2008 and July 2010, as well as interest and credit facility fees on the revolving line of credit. Our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income include interest expense netted with interest income, which is derived primarily from the investment of funds in excess of our immediate operating requirements. 
The quarter over quarter increase in interest expense of $0.5 million was primarily attributable to a higher average outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit, partially offset by the $72.0 million principal payment in July 2017 on the senior notes issued in July 2010, resulting in lower average debt balance for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
The year-to-date period over period increase in interest expense of $0.8 million was primarily attributable to a higher average outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit, partially offset by the $72.0 million principal payment in July 2017 on the senior notes issued in July 2010, resulting in lower average debt balance for the six months ended March 31, 2018.
Over the next several quarters we expect net interest expense will be higher than the net interest expense incurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Operating Income
Applications
The quarter over quarter $8.0 million increase in operating income was attributable to a $29.5 million increase in segment revenues and a $1.6 million decrease in amortization cost, partially offset by a $10.3 million increase in segment operating expenses, an $8.3 million increase in corporate expenses and a $4.5 million increase in share-based compensation cost.
The quarter over quarter $4.8 million increase in Applications segment operating income was due to a $12.4 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by a $7.6 million increase in segment operating expenses. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Applications was 27%, materially consistent with the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
The quarter over quarter $20.5 million increase in Scores segment operating income was due to a $22.4 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in segment operating expenses. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Scores increased to 81% from 78% mainly due to an increase in sales of our higher-margin score products.
The year-to-date period over period increase of $13.0 million in operating income was attributable to a $45.2 million increase in segment revenues and a $3.1 million decrease in amortization cost, partially offset by an $18.4 million increase in segment operating expenses, a $10.4 million increase in corporate expenses and a $6.5 million increase in share-based compensation cost.
At the segment level, the year-to-date period over period increase of $16.4 million in segment operating income was the result of a $28.5 million increase in our Scores segment operating income and an $8.6 million increase in our Applications segment operating income, partially offset by a $10.4 million increase in corporate expenses and a $10.3 million increase in our Decision Management Software segment operating loss.
The year-to-date period over period $8.6 million increase in Applications segment operating income was due to a $19.0 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by a $10.4 million increase in segment operating expenses. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Applications was 27%, materially consistent with the six months ended March 31, 2017.
The year-to-date period over period $28.5 million increase in Scores segment operating income was attributable to a $33.0 million increase in segment revenue, partially offset by a $4.5 million increase in segment operating expenses. Segment operating income as a percentage of segment revenue for Scores increased to 80% from 78%, mainly due to an increase in sales of our higher-margin score products.
Outlook
Summary of Cash Flows 
Our primary method for funding operations and growth has been through cash flows generated from operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $78.0 million during the six months ended March 31, 2018 from $99.4 million during the six months ended March 31, 2017. The $21.4 million decrease was mainly attributable to a $26.8 million decrease that resulted from timing of receipts and payments in our ordinary course of business.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities increased to $13.3 million for six months ended March 31, 2018 from $9.6 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The $3.7 million increase was attributable to a $2.2 million increase in purchases, net of proceeds from sale, of marketable securities as well as a $1.5 million increase in purchases of property and equipment.
Net cash used in financing activities increased to $64.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 from $48.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The $16.0 million increase was mainly due to a $50.0 million increase in repurchases of common stock, a $7.4 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and a $3.5 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by a $44.0 million increase in proceeds, net of payments, from our revolving line of credit.
In July 2016, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program following the completion of our previous program. This program was open-ended and authorized repurchases of shares of our common stock up to an aggregate cost of $250.0 million in the open market or in negotiated transactions. In October 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program following the completion of the July 2016 program. The new program is open-ended and authorizes repurchases of shares of our common stock up to an aggregate cost of $250.0 million in the open market or in negotiated transactions.
Pursuant to the October 2017 program, we repurchased 461,003 shares of our common stock at a total repurchase price of $75.0 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and pursuant to the July 2016 and October 2017 programs, we repurchased 795,921 shares of our common stock at a total repurchase price of $124.6 million during the six months ended March 31, 2018. We had $162.0 million remaining under the October 2017 authorization as of March 31, 2018.
We have a $600 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a syndicate of banks that expires on December 30, 2019. Proceeds from the credit facility can be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and may also be used for the refinancing of existing debt, acquisitions, and the repurchase of our common stock. Interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is based on (i) a base rate, which is the greater of (a) the prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.500% and (c) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.000%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for base rate borrowings ranges from 0% to 0.875% and for LIBOR borrowings ranges from 1.000% to 1.875%, and is determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we must pay credit facility fees. The credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants including maintaining a minimum fixed charge ratio of 2.5 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0, subject to a step up to 3.5 following certain permitted acquisitions. The credit agreement also contains other covenants typical of unsecured facilities. As of March 31, 2018, we had $460.0 million in borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 2.973% and were in compliance with all financial covenants under this credit facility. Depending on market conditions, we may refinance some of our debt in 2018.
On May 7, 2008, we issued $275 million of senior notes in a private placement to a group of institutional investors (the “2008 Senior Notes”). The 2008 Senior Notes were issued in four series with maturities ranging from 5 to 10 years. The outstanding 2008 Senior Notes’ weighted average interest rate is 7.2% and the weighted average maturity is 10.0 years. On July 14, 2010, we issued $245 million of senior notes in a private placement to a group of institutional investors (the “2010 Senior Notes” and, with the 2008 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”). The 2010 Senior Notes were issued in four series with maturities ranging from 6 to 10 years. The 2010 Senior Notes’ weighted average interest rate is 5.6% and the weighted average maturity is 9.8 years. The Senior Notes are subject to certain restrictive covenants that are substantially similar to those in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility, including maintenance of consolidated leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The purchase agreements for the Senior Notes also include covenants typical of unsecured facilities. As of March 31, 2018, the carrying value of the Senior Notes was $243.9 million and we were in compliance with all financial covenants under these facilities.
Revenue Recognition
Software Licenses
Software license fee revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, software is made available to our customers, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. The determination of whether fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable involves the use of assumptions. If at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. If at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectability is not probable, revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectability becomes probable or the receipt of payment. If there is uncertainty as to the customer’s acceptance of our deliverables, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance, expiration of the acceptance period, or when we can demonstrate we meet the acceptance criteria. We evaluate contract terms and customer information to ensure that these criteria are met prior to our recognition of license fee revenue.
Revenues from post-contract customer support services, such as software maintenance, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the support period. The majority of our software maintenance agreements provide technical support as well as unspecified software product upgrades and releases when and if made available by us during the term of the support period.
Transactional-Based Revenues
Services that are sold in connection with software license arrangements generally qualify for separate accounting from the license element because they do not involve significant production, modification or customization of our products and are not otherwise considered to be essential to the functionality of our software. In arrangements where the professional services do not qualify for separate accounting from the license element, the combined software license and professional services revenue are recognized based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method.
If a deliverable does not have standalone value because the aforementioned criteria are not met, we combine it with the other applicable undelivered item(s) within the arrangement and account for the multiple deliverables as one combined unit of accounting. For example, for hosting arrangements requiring a highly specialized and unique set of initial implementation and setup services prior to the commencement of hosting services, we typically conclude that these implementation or setup services do not have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis; therefore, we combine them with the hosting services as a combined unit of accounting. Revenue is recognized upon commencement of our hosting services over the expected life of the customer relationship.
Gross vs. Net Revenue Reporting
Business Combinations
Goodwill, Acquisition Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets - Impairment Assessment
For fiscal 2017, we elected to proceed directly to the step one quantitative analysis for all of our reporting units, as three years had elapsed since the date of our previous quantitative valuation. There was a substantial excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units and we determined goodwill was not impaired for any of our reporting units for fiscal 2017. 
Share-Based Compensation
A description of our accounting policies associated with tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above.
Contingencies and Litigation
New Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU 2014-09”). ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, “Deferral of the Effective Date” (“ASU 2015-14”), which defers the effective date for ASU 2014-09 by one year. For public entities, the guidance in ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods), which means it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted to the original effective date of December 15, 2016 (including interim reporting periods within those periods). In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, “Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net)” (“ASU 2016-08”), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, “Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing” (“ASU 2016-10”), which reduces the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 “Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients” (“ASU 2016-12”), which amends the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. In December 2016, the FASB further issued ASU 2016-20, “Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2016-20”), which makes minor corrections or minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. The amendments are intended to address implementation issues that were raised by stakeholders and provide additional practical expedients to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue standard. These amendments have the same effective date as the new revenue standard. Preliminarily, we plan to adopt Topic 606 in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019 using the retrospective transition method, and are continuing to evaluate the impact our pending adoption of Topic 606 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
We have established a cross-functional implementation team consisting of representatives across the organization to address the scope of work required to implement the recognition and disclosure requirements under the new standard. This cross-functional implementation team has developed a project plan, which includes evaluating customer contracts across the organization, developing policies, processes and tools to report financial results, and implementing and evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting that will be necessary under the new standard. We currently plan to adopt Topic 606 in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019 using the retrospective transition method. Our ability to adopt Topic 606 using the full retrospective method is dependent on system readiness, and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements. As we continue to assess the new standard along with industry trends and additional interpretive guidance, we may adjust our implementation plan accordingly.
•Presentation of contract balances. Under the new standard, when we enter into noncancellable contracts that provide unconditional rights to payment from our customers for services that we have not yet completed providing or services we will provide in the near future, we expect to present the unconditional rights as receivables, regardless of whether cash has been received from customers; 
•Required disclosures including information about remaining transaction price and when we expect to recognize revenue; and
•Accounting for commissions under the new standard will result in the deferral of incremental commission costs for obtaining contracts.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”), which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, which means it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the timing of our adoption and the impact that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
