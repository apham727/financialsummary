 1.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION  



Basis of Consolidation  



Watsco, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, Watsco, we, us or our) was incorporated in Florida in 1956 and is the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies (HVAC/R) in the HVAC/R distribution industry in North America.
The accompanying June 30, 2018 interim condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements included herein.
The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this report include the accounts of Watsco, all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of three joint ventures with Carrier Corporation (Carrier), in each of which Watsco maintains a controlling interest.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment, and parts and supplies are seasonal.
Furthermore, results of operations can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on weather patterns, primarily during the Summer and Winter selling seasons.
The excess, if any, of the carrying amount of our investment over our ownership percentage in the underlying net assets of the investee is attributed to certain fair value adjustments with the remaining portion recognized as goodwill.
Reclassifications  



Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the 2018 presentation.
These reclassifications had no effect on net income or earnings per share as previously reported.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  



Revenue Recognition  



In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued a standard on revenue recognition that provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers.
The standard is principle-based and provides a five-step model to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized.
In 2015 and 2016, the FASB issued several updates to this standard.
See Note 2.
7 of 24  



Table of Contents 



Financial Instruments  



In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.
Most prominent among the changes to the standard is the requirement that changes in the fair value of equity investments, with certain exceptions, be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income.
This guidance must be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings and became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
A cumulative-effect adjustment captured the previously held unrealized losses of $301 related to our equity investment carried at fair value.
See Note 4.
Stock Compensation  



In May 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
This guidance must be applied prospectively and became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
Derivatives and Hedging  



In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for hedging derivatives.
This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted  



Leases  



In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
We will apply this guidance using a modified retrospective approach, and it will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
We are in the process of collecting data and designing processes and controls to account for our leases in accordance with the new guidance.
Our current minimum lease commitments are disclosed in Note 16 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
IntangiblesGoodwill and Other  



In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
Under this updated standard, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted.
2.
REVENUES  



Adoption of New Revenue Standard  



We adopted the New Revenue Standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach.
Results for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2018 are presented under the New Revenue Standard, while prior period results have not been adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
Revenue Recognition  



Revenue primarily consists of sales of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies.
We satisfy our performance obligations for services when we render the services within the agreed-upon service period.
Total service revenue is not material and accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated revenues for both the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018.
Revenue for shipping and handling charges is recognized when products are delivered to the customer.
Product Returns  



We estimate product returns based on historical experience and record them on a gross basis.
Substantially all customer returns relate to products that are returned under manufacturers warranty obligations.
Sales Incentives  



We estimate sales incentives expected to be paid over the term of the program based on the most likely amount.
Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction in the transaction price and are generally paid on an annual basis.
Disaggregation of Revenues  



The following table presents our revenues disaggregated by primary geographical regions and major product lines within our single reporting segment:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



   (1) As noted above, prior period amounts have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method and remain as originally reported for such periods.
Practical Expedients  



We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS) INCOME  



Other comprehensive (loss) income consists of the foreign currency translation adjustment associated with our Canadian operations use of the Canadian dollar as its functional currency and changes in the unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedging instruments and equity securities.
The tax effects allocated to each component of other comprehensive (loss) income were as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were as follows:

 5.
DEBT  



We maintain an unsecured, syndicated revolving credit agreement, which we use to fund seasonal working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, dividends (if and as declared by our Board of Directors), capital expenditures, stock repurchases and issuances of letters of credit.
Effective February 5, 2018, we decreased the borrowing capacity under this credit agreement from $600,000 to $300,000.
Included in the credit facility are a $90,000 swingline subfacility, a $10,000 letter of credit subfacility and a $75,000 multicurrency borrowing sublimit.
The credit agreement matures on July 1, 2019.

Table of Contents 



At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $141,600 and $21,800, respectively, were outstanding under the revolving credit agreement.
We believe we were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2018.
At June 30, 2018, $1,510 of short-term borrowings were outstanding under a credit line established by our Mexican subsidiary.
This line of credit has a one-year term, maturing on June 12, 2019, is non-committed and provides for borrowings of up to approximately $3,800 (MXN 75,000) for general corporate purposes.
No short-term borrowings were outstanding under this credit line at December 31, 2017.
6.
PURCHASE OF ADDITIONAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE  



On February 13, 2017, we purchased an additional 10% ownership interest in Carrier Enterprise Northeast LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise II, for cash consideration of $42,688, which increased our controlling interest from 70% to 80%.
Carrier Enterprise II was formed in 2011 as a joint venture with Carrier.
Carrier Enterprise II had sales of approximately $545,000 in 2017 from 40 locations in the northeastern United States and 14 locations in Mexico.
7.
INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY  



On June 21, 2017, our first joint venture with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise, LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, acquired an approximately 35% ownership interest in Russell Sigler, Inc. (RSI), an HVAC distributor with 2017 sales of approximately $680,000, operating from 30 locations in the Western U.S. We have an 80% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise I, and Carrier has a 20% non-controlling interest.
Carrier Enterprise I acquired its ownership interest in RSI for cash consideration of $63,600, of which we contributed $50,880 and Carrier contributed $12,720.
Effective June 29, 2018, Carrier Enterprise I acquired an additional 1.4% voting equity interest in RSI, which increased Carrier Enterprise Is ownership interest in RSI from approximately 35% to 36.3%.
Total cash consideration of $3,760 was paid on July 5, 2018, of which we contributed $3,008 and Carrier contributed $752.
Carrier Enterprise I entered into a shareholders agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) with RSI and its shareholders.
Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, RSIs shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on either book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price paid for its investment in RSI.
Additionally, Carrier Enterprise I has the right to appoint two of RSIs six board members.
Given Carrier Enterprise Is 36.3% voting equity interest in RSI and its right to appoint two out of RSIs six board members, this investment in RSI is accounted for under the equity method.

DERIVATIVES  



We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the earnings impact that foreign exchange rate fluctuations would otherwise have on certain monetary liabilities that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies.
Cash Flow Hedging Instruments  



We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges.
The settlement of these derivatives results in reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings for the period in which the settlement of these instruments occurs.
The maximum period for which we hedge our cash flow using these instruments is 12 months.
Accordingly, at June 30, 2018, all of our open foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of one year or less.
The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at June 30, 2018 was $31,700, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through March 2019.
The impact from foreign exchange derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges was as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



At June 30, 2018, we expected an estimated $941 pre-tax gain to be reclassified into earnings to reflect the fixed prices obtained from foreign exchange hedging within the next 12 months.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments  



We have also entered into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are either not designated as hedges or did not qualify for hedge accounting.
These derivative instruments were effective economic hedges for all of the periods presented.
We recognized losses of $191 and $410 from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
See Note 9.

Fair values for these investments are based on closing stock prices from active markets and are therefore classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Derivative financial instruments  these derivatives are foreign currency forward and option contracts.
See Note 8.
Fair value is based on observable market inputs, such as forward rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivatives within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Self-Insurance  



Self-insurance reserves are maintained relative to company-wide casualty insurance and health benefit programs.
The level of exposure from catastrophic events is limited by the purchase of stop-loss and aggregate liability reinsurance coverage.
Management reviews its assumptions with its independent third-party actuaries to evaluate whether the self-insurance reserves are adequate.
If actual claims or adverse development of loss reserves occur and exceed these estimates, additional reserves may be required.
