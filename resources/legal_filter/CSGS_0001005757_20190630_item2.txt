Impact of New Lease Accounting Pronouncement 



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASC 842”), which requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than twelve months on its balance sheet.
We adopted the ASU in January of 2019, utilizing the effective date method of transition.
Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to our Financial Statements for further detail regarding the adoption of ASC 842.

Management Overview of Quarterly Results 



Second Quarter Highlights.
Revenues.
Revenues for the second quarter of 2019 were $245.9 million, a 15% increase when compared to revenues of $213.0 million for the second quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the additional revenues generated from the acquisition of Forte on October 1, 2018, and the continued growth in our cloud solutions and managed service arrangements.
Operating income for the second quarter of 2019 was $30.3 million, or a 12.3% operating margin percentage, compared to $24.1 million, or an 11.3% operating margin percentage for the second quarter of 2018.
Diluted EPS.
Diluted EPS for the second quarter of 2019 was $0.60 compared to $0.46 for the second quarter of 2018, reflective of the higher operating income for the second quarter of 2019.
Cash and Cash Flows.
As of June 30, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $131.5 million, as compared to $141.9 million as of March 31, 2019 and $162.9 million as of December 31, 2018.
Our cash flows from operating activities for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 were $15.6 million.
See the Liquidity section below for further discussion of our cash flows.
Significant Client Relationships  



Client Concentration.
A large percentage of our historical revenues have been generated from our two largest clients, which are Comcast and Charter Corporation Inc. (“Charter”).
Comcast.
In November 2018, Comcast exercised the first of their two one-year renewal options extending the term of their agreement through June 30, 2020.
Terms of the extension remain consistent with the financial terms and obligations under the existing agreement.
Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, Comcast has the right to exercise an additional one-year renewal option no later than January 1, 2020, to extend the term of the Agreement through June 30, 2021.
We are currently engaged in discussions with Comcast regarding contract renewal terms.
Although we believe our operating relationship with Comcast is good, there can be no assurances around the timing and/or terms of any renewal arrangements at this time.
A copy of the Comcast agreement and related amendments, with confidential information redacted, is included in the exhibits to our periodic filings with the SEC.
Risk of Client Concentration.
There are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of total revenues are concentrated with a limited number of clients.
Critical Accounting Policies  



The preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to select appropriate accounting policies, and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies.
Those critical accounting policies were determined by considering the accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments.
Total revenues for the: (i) second quarter of 2019 were $245.9 million, a 15% increase when compared to $213.0 million for the second quarter of 2018; and (ii) six months ended June 30, 2019 were $490.6 million, an 18% increase when compared to $414.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The year-over-year increase in second quarter revenues can be mainly attributed to the additional revenues generated from the Forte acquisition on October 1, 2018, and the continued growth in our cloud solutions and managed services arrangements.
Additionally, the six months ended June 30, 2019 includes a full six months of revenues from Business Ink (acquired on February 28, 2018), compared to only four months of revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2018.

The components of total revenues, discussed in more detail below, are as follows (in thousands): 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



We use the location of the client as the basis of attributing revenues to individual countries.
Revenues by geographic regions for the second quarters and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands): 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Cloud and Related Solutions Revenues.
Cloud and related solutions revenues for: (i) the second quarter of 2019 were $222.2 million, a 19% increase when compared to $187.4 million for the second quarter of 2018; and (ii) six months ended June 30, 2019 were $441.8 million, a 21% increase when compared to $364.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
These increases between periods in cloud and related solutions revenues are primarily due to the additional revenues generated from the acquired Forte business, and to a lesser degree, the execution of and performance under managed services arrangements, mentioned above.
In addition, the year-to-date increase is also attributable to the 2019 full period impact of the additional revenues from the Business Ink acquisition.
Software and Services Revenues.
Software and services revenues for the: (i) second quarter of 2019 were $12.2 million, a 9% decrease when compared to $13.3 million for the second quarter of 2018; and (ii) six months ended June 30, 2019 were $25.2 million, a slight decrease when compared to $25.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
These decreases are mainly attributed to the timing of work performed and execution of software license agreements.
Maintenance Revenues.
Maintenance revenues for the: (i) second quarter of 2019 were $11.5 million, a 7% decrease when compared to $12.3 million for the second quarter of 2018; and (ii) six months ended June 30, 2019 were $23.7 million, a 3% decrease when compared to $24.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
These decreases are due mainly to the timing of maintenance renewals and related revenue recognition.
We continue to transition our focus towards more predictable recurring revenues models with our managed services arrangements and delivery of our cloud-based solutions and away from large transformational software and services deals with related maintenance agreements.
Total Expenses.
Our operating expenses for the: (i) second quarter of 2019 were $215.5 million, a 14% increase when compared to $188.9 million for the second quarter of 2018; and (ii) six months ended June 30, 2019 were $428.2 million, a 17% increase when compared to $364.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
The components of total expenses are discussed in more detail below.
Cost of Revenues.
See our 2018 10-K for a description of the types of costs that are included in the individual line items for cost of revenues.

The components of cost of revenues, discussed in more detail below, are as follows (in thousands): 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Cost of Cloud and Related Solutions (Exclusive of Depreciation).
The cost of cloud and related solutions for the: (i) second quarter of 2019 increased 25% to $118.6 million, from $95.2 million for the second quarter of 2018; and (ii) six months ended June 30, 2019 increased 28% to $233.3 million, from $182.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
These increases can be mainly attributed to the cloud and related solutions expense of the acquired Forte business included in our results, to include acquisition amortization, and increased employee-related costs, with the year-to-date increase also reflective of the 2019 full period impact of the acquired Business Ink business.
Total cloud and related solutions cost as a percentage of cloud and related solutions revenues for the: (i) second quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 53.4% and 50.8%, respectively; and (ii) six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were 52.8% and 49.9%, respectively (with the second quarter and six months of ended June 30, 2019 reflective of transaction fees of $17.8 million and $34.9 million, respectively).
Cost of Software and Services (Exclusive of Depreciation).
The cost of software and services for the: (i) second quarter of 2019 was $8.2 million, a slight decrease when compared to $8.6 million for the second quarter of 2018; and (ii) six months ended June 30, 2019 was $17.1 million, consistent with the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Total software and services cost as a percentage of our software and services revenues for the: (i) second quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 67.6% and 64.6%, respectively; and (ii) six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were 67.8% for both periods.
Variability in quarterly revenues and operating results are inherent characteristics of companies that sell software licenses and perform professional services.

The cost of maintenance for the (i) second quarter of 2019 was $5.4 million, a slight decrease from $5.7 million for the second quarter of 2018; and (ii) and six months ended June 30, 2019 decreased 4% to $10.8 million, from $11.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
Total cost of maintenance as a percentage of our maintenance revenues for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 46.7% and 46.1%, respectively; and (ii) six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were 45.7% and 46.2%, respectively.
R&D Expense.
R&D expense for the: (i) second quarter of 2019 was $30.6 million, relatively consistent when compared to $31.0 million for the second quarter of 2018; and (ii) and six months ended June 30, 2019 increased 5% to $63.2 million, from $60.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
As a percentage of total revenues, R&D expense for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 12.5% and 14.5%, respectively (with the percentage decrease reflective of transaction fees of $17.8 million).
Our R&D efforts are focused on the continued evolution of our solutions that enable service providers worldwide to provide a more personalized customer experience while introducing new digital products and services.
Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expense.
SG&A expense for the: (i) second quarter of 2019 increased 12% to $45.4 million, from $40.6 million for the second quarter of 2018; and (ii) and six months ended June 30, 2019 increased 12% to $91.3 million, from $81.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
These increases are primarily due to the SG&A costs related to Forte business.
Our SG&A costs as a percentage of total revenues for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 18.5% and 19.1%, respectively (with the percentage decrease reflective of transaction fees of $17.8 million).
20

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt.
Liquidity  



Cash and Liquidity 



As of June 30, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $131.5 million, as compared to $141.9 million as of March 31, 2019 and $162.9 million as of December 31, 2018.
As part of our 2018 Credit Agreement, we have a $200 million senior secured revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in March 2023.
As of June 30, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding on the 2018 Revolver.
The 2018 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and financial covenants.
As of June 30, 2019, and the date of this filing, we believe that we are in compliance with the provisions of the 2018 Credit Agreement.
Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances as of the end of the indicated periods were located in the following geographical regions (in thousands):  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



We generally have ready access to substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances, but may face limitations on moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions due to currency controls.
As of June 30, 2019, we had $3.1 million of cash restricted as to use primarily to collateralize outstanding letters of credit.
21 



Cash Flows from Operating Activities  



We calculate our cash flows from operating activities in accordance with U.S. GAAP, beginning with net income, adding back the impact of non-cash items or non-operating activity (e.g., depreciation, amortization, amortization of OID, impairments, gain/loss from debt extinguishments, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation, etc.
), and then factoring in the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities.
See our 2018 10-K for a description of the primary uses and sources of our cash flows from operating activities.
Our 2019 and 2018 net cash flows from operating activities, broken out between operations and changes in operating assets and liabilities, for the indicated quarterly periods are as follows (in thousands): 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 reflect the negative impacts of the payment of the 2018 and 2017 year-end accrued employee incentive compensation in the first quarter subsequent to the year-end accrual for these items.
Additionally, cash flows from operating activities for the first and second quarters of 2019, and the second quarter of 2018, were negatively impacted by the timing around certain recurring client payments that were received subsequent to quarter-end.
22 



Significant fluctuations in key operating assets and liabilities between 2019 and 2018 that impacted our cash flows from operating activities are as follows:  



Billed Trade Accounts Receivable 



Management of our billed accounts receivable is one of the primary factors in maintaining consistently strong quarterly cash flows from operating activities.
Our gross and net billed trade accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts receivable (“Allowance”) as of the end of the indicated quarterly periods, and the related DBOs for the quarters then ended, are as follows (in thousands, except DBOs):  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of June 30, 2019, approximately 95% of our billed accounts receivable balance is less than 60 days past due.
As a global provider of software and professional services, a portion of our accounts receivable balance relates to clients outside the U.S.
This diversity in the geographic composition of our client base may adversely impact our DBOs as longer billing cycles (i.e., billing terms and cash collection cycles) are an inherent characteristic of international software and professional services transactions.
For example, our ability to bill (i.e., send an invoice) and collect arrangement fees may be dependent upon, among other things: (i) the completion of various client administrative matters, local country billing protocols and processes (including local cultural differences), and/or non-client administrative matters; (ii) us meeting certain contractual invoicing milestones; or (iii) the overall project status in certain situations in which we act as a subcontractor to another vendor on a project.
Accrued Employee Compensation 



Accrued employee compensation decreased $9.7 million to $51.4 million as of June 30, 2019, from $61.1 million as of December 31, 2018, due primarily to the payment of the 2018 employee incentive compensation that was fully accrued at December 31, 2018, offset to a certain degree by the accrual for the 2019 employee incentive compensation.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities 



Our typical investing activities consist of purchases/sales of short-term investments and purchases of software, property and equipment, which are discussed below.
Additionally, during the first quarter of 2018 we acquired Business Ink for approximately $70 million ($68.6 million, net of cash acquired), and in the first quarter of 2019, as discussed in Note 2 to our Financial Statements, made an additional investment in a payment technology and services company for $4.0 million, which is included in our cash flows from investing activities.
Purchases/Sales of Short-term Investments.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, we purchased $22.5 million and $44.3 million, respectively, and sold (or had mature) $28.8 million and $116.9 million, respectively, of short-term investments.
Software, Property and Equipment.
Our capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 for software, property and equipment were $17.9 million and $26.7 million, respectively, and consisted principally of investments in: (i) statement production equipment; (ii) computer hardware, software, and related equipment; and (iii) facilities and internal infrastructure items.
23 



Cash Flows from Financing Activities  



Our financing activities typically consist of activities associated with our common stock and our long-term debt.
Cash Dividends Paid on Common Stock.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Board approved dividends totaling $14.7 million and $14.2 million, respectively, and made dividend payments of $14.8 million and $14.4 million, respectively, through June 30, 2019 and 2018 (with the differences attributed to unvested incentive shares that are paid upon vesting).
During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 0.4 million and 0.3 million shares of our common stock, respectively, under the guidelines of our Stock Repurchase Program for $15.8 million and $11.3 million, respectively, and paid $16.2 million and $11.3 million, respectively, through June 30, 2019 and 2018 (with the differences attributed to shares accrued but not yet paid as of December 31, 2018 and 2017).
Long-term Debt.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, we made principal repayments of $3.8 million and $1.9 million respectively.
During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement and as a result, we repaid the outstanding principal balance of $120.0 million and borrowed $150.0 million under the 2018 Credit Agreement, resulting in a net increase of available cash of $30.0 million.
As part of the refinancing, we paid $1.5 million of deferred financing costs.
Capital Resources  



The following are the key items to consider in assessing our sources and uses of capital resources:  



Current Sources of Capital Resources.
•  



Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments.
As of June 30, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $131.5 million, of which approximately 60% is in U.S. dollars and held in the U.S. We have $3.1 million of restricted cash, used primarily to collateralize outstanding letters of credit.
For the remainder of the monies denominated in foreign currencies and/or located outside the U.S., we do not anticipate any material amounts being unavailable for use in running our business.
•  



Operating Cash Flows.
As described in the Liquidity section above, we believe we have the ability to generate strong cash flows to fund our operating activities and act as a source of funds for our capital resource needs.
•  



Revolving Credit Facility.
We currently have a $200 million revolving loan facility, our 2018 Revolver.
Uses/Potential Uses of Capital Resources.
Below are the key items to consider in assessing our uses/potential uses of capital resources:  



•  



Common Stock Repurchases.
As of June 30, 2019, we had 5.1 million shares authorized for repurchase remaining under our Stock Repurchase Program.
Under our Stock Repurchase Program, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including through an accelerated stock repurchase plan or under a SEC Rule 10b5-1 plan.
Our common stock repurchases are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to our Financial Statements.
24 



During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of our common stock for $15.8 million (weighted-average price of $40.31 per share).
•  



Cash Dividends.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Board declared dividends totaling $14.7 million.
Going forward, we expect to pay cash dividends each year in March, June, September, and December, with the amount and timing subject to the Board’s approval.
•  



Acquisition.
On October 1, 2018, we acquired Forte, a leading provider of advanced payment solutions headquartered in Allen, Texas for a purchase price of approximately $93 million, (approximately $85 million, excluding cash acquired), and held back approximately $13 million in cash subject to certain tax filings, which was paid in July 2019.
The purchase agreement includes provisions for $18.8 million of potential future earn-out payments over a four-year measurement period.
The earn-out payments are tied to performance-based goals and continued employment by the eligible recipients.
•  



Equity Method Investment.
In the first quarter of 2019, we made an additional $4 million investment in a payment technology and services company that enables omni-channel digital payments in Latin America.
As of June 30, 2019, we held an 8% noncontrolling interest with a carrying value of $6.7 million.
•  



Capital Expenditures.
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we spent $17.9 million on capital expenditures.
•  



Stock Warrants.
In 2014, we issued Stock Warrants with an exercise price of $26.68 per warrant to Comcast as an incentive for Comcast to convert new customer accounts to ACP.
Once vested, Comcast may exercise the Stock Warrants and elect either physical delivery of common shares or net share settlement (cashless exercise).
As of June 30, 2019, 1.4 million Stock Warrants are outstanding, of which 0.4 million are vested.
The Stock Warrants are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to our Financial Statements.
•  



Long-Term Debt.
As of June 30, 2019, our long-term debt consisted of the following: (i) 2016 Convertible Notes with a par value of $230.0 million; and (ii) 2018 Credit Agreement with term loan borrowings of $140.6 million.
2016 Convertible Notes 



During the next twelve months, there are no scheduled conversion triggers on our 2016 Convertible Notes.
As a result, we expect our required debt service cash outlay during the next twelve months for the 2016 Convertible Notes to be limited to interest payments of $9.8 million.
2018 Credit Agreement 



Our 2018 Credit Agreement mandatory repayments and the cash interest expense (based upon current interest rates) for the next twelve months is $8.4 million, and $5.9 million, respectively.
In summary, we expect to continue to have material needs for capital resources going forward, as noted above.
