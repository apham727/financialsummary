AstroNova is a multi-national enterprise that leverages its proprietary data visualization technologies to design, develop, manufacture, distribute and service a broad range of products that acquire, store, analyze and present data in multiple formats.
The Company organizes its structure around a core set of competencies, including research and development, manufacturing, service, marketing and distribution.
It markets and sells its products and services through the following two segments:  



       



Product Identification (PI)  offers digital label printers, over-printers, labeling software, spare parts, service contracts and related printing supplies such as pressure sensitive labels, tags, inks, toners and thermal transfer ribbons used in those product identification digital printers.
    



Test and Measurement (T&M)  offers a suite of products and services that acquire data from local and networked data streams and sensors as well as wired and wireless networks.
The recorded data is processed and analyzed and then stored and presented in various visual output formats.
The T&M segment also includes a line of aerospace printers that are used to print hard copies of data required for the safe and efficient operation of aircraft, including navigation maps, arrival and departure procedures, flight itineraries, weather maps, performance data, passenger data, and various air traffic control data.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The first quarter of fiscal 2020 consisted of a 13-week period as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 which consisted of a 12-week period.
Revenue for the first quarter of the current year was $36.2 million, representing a 14.9% increase compared to the previous year first quarter revenue of $31.5 million.
Revenue through domestic channels for the current year first quarter was $22.0 million, an increase of 14.6% over the prior years first quarter.
International revenue for the first quarter of the current year was $14.2 million, a 15.8% increase over the previous year first quarter, and represents 39.2% of AstroNovas first quarters revenue.
Current year first quarter international revenue includes an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.6 million.
The increase is attributable to both segments, as T&M hardware revenue increased 8.5% and PI hardware revenue increased 6.1% compared to the first quarter of the prior year.
The current quarter increase in supplies revenue compared to the first quarter of the prior year is primarily attributable to increases in revenue of both digital color printer supplies and label and tag products within the Product Identification segment.
Current year first quarter gross profit was $14.2 million, a 17.6% increase compared to prior year first quarter gross profit of $12.1 million.
The Companys current quarter gross profit margin of 39.4% reflects a 0.9 percentage point increase from prior year first quarter gross profit margin of 38.5%.
Operating expenses for the current quarter were $11.8 million, an 8.5% increase compared to prior year first quarter operating expenses of $10.8 million.
Specifically, selling and marketing expenses for the current quarter increased to $6.8 million compared to $6.5 million in the first quarter of the prior year due primarily to an increase in wages and commissions.
Current quarter general and administrative expenses were $3.0 million, a slight increase compared to $2.7 million in the prior years first quarter, as the current quarter increase in outside services was tempered by decreases in wage and bonus expense for the current quarter.
The R&D spending as a percentage of revenue for the current quarter is 5.5% compared to 5.4% for the same period of the prior year.
Other expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $0.4 million compared to $0.3 million in the prior year first quarter.
Current quarter other expense includes interest expense on debt of $0.2 million and foreign exchange loss of $0.2 million.
Other expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 consists primarily of interest expense on debt of $0.2 million and foreign exchange loss of $0.1 million.
The Company reported net income of $1.7 million or $0.23 per diluted share for the first quarter of the current year.
On a comparable basis, net income for the prior year first quarter was $0.8 million or $0.12 per diluted share, which included after-tax income of $0.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, as a result of a change in accounting estimates for product cost and operating expenses related to a transition services agreement entered into as a part of the fiscal 2018 Honeywell licenses and product line acquisition.
Return on revenue was 4.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to 2.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

Segment Analysis  



The Company reports two segments: Product Identification and Test & Measurement (T&M) and evaluates segment performance based on the segment profit before corporate and financial administration expenses.
Summarized below are the Revenue and Segment Operating Profit for each reporting segment:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Product Identification  



Revenue from the Product Identification segment increased 18.2% in the first quarter of the current year, with revenue of $23.6 million compared to $20.0 million in the same period of the prior year.
The current quarter increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the increase in supplies revenue, specifically, labels and tag supplies revenue and inkjet supply revenue, both experiencing double digit growth as compared to the same period in the prior year.
Also contributing to the increase in revenue for the current quarter was the 6.1% increase in hardware revenue as a result of the Companys new five-color digital label printer, as well as an increase in sales of monochromatic printers.
Hardware revenue increases were slightly tempered by lower sales of the Companys other digital color printers within the product group.
The current quarter also experienced growth in parts revenue compared to the same period in the prior year.
Product Identifications current quarter segment operating profit was $2.9 million, reflecting a profit margin of 12.2%.
This compares to prior years first quarter segment profit of $1.7 million and related profit margin of 8.3%.
Test & MeasurementT&M  



Revenue from the T&M products was $12.6 million for the first quarter of the current fiscal year, representing a 9.2% increase compared to revenue of $11.5 million for the same period in the prior year.
The current quarter revenue increase is primarily due to the double digit growth in data acquisition hardware sales.
Also contributing to the growth in revenue for the first quarter is the increase in parts revenue related to the aerospace printer product line acquired from Honeywell in fiscal 2018.

Cash Flow  



The Companys statements of cash flows for the three months ended May 4, 2019 and April 28, 2018 are included on page 7 of this report.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to cash used by operating activities of $1.6 million for the same period of the previous year.
The increase in net cash provided by operations for the current quarter is primarily due to the increase in net income and the decrease in cash used for working capital.

The decreased cash and investment position at May 4, 2019 primarily resulted from increased cash provided by in operations as discussed above, offset by principal payments of long-term debt of $1.6 million, principal payment of guaranteed royalty obligation of $0.4 million, dividends paid of $0.5 million and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $0.6 million.
