Forward-Looking Statements
NM - Not meaningful; we recognized a net loss for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
We adopted ASC 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for impact of this adoption on our operating results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019.

Three Months Ended January 26, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended January 27, 2018
Total revenue increased by 5% compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Within total revenue, product revenue increased by 6% and service revenue was flat. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, on October 28, 2018, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business. Total revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 7% not including revenue from SPVSS business in the prior year period. Total gross margin decreased by 0.6 percentage points, driven by unfavorable impacts from pricing and productivity. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, decreased by 1.1 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.1 percentage points. The net loss and net loss per share in the prior year period were driven by the one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, foreign withholding taxes, and re-measurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. 
In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas increased $348 million, EMEA revenue increased by $161 million, and revenue in our APJC segment increased by $52 million. These increases reflect broad strength across several countries within these segments. The “BRICM” countries experienced product revenue growth of 5% in the aggregate, driven by increased product revenue in the emerging countries of Mexico, India, Brazil and Russia of 35%, 18%, 14% and 4%, respectively, partially offset by a product revenue decrease of 16% in China.
From a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue growth in the public sector, enterprise and commercial markets, partially offset by a product revenue decline in the service provider market. 
From a product category perspective, total product revenue, not including SPVSS products in the prior year period, increased 9% year over year. The increase was driven by a 6% product revenue increase in Infrastructure Platforms and solid product revenue growth in Applications and Security, which grew by 24% and 18% respectively. 
Table of Contents 
Total revenue increased 6%, with product revenue increasing 8% and service revenue increasing 2%. Total gross margin increased by 0.3 percentage points due to productivity benefits and a $127 million legal and indemnification settlement charge recorded in the first six months of fiscal 2018, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 2.7 percentage points due to lower general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased due to a benefit from the $400 million litigation settlement with Arista in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 3.2 percentage points. The net loss and net loss per share in the prior year period were driven by similar factors as discussed in the three-month period immediately above.

Revenue Recognition 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition. ASC 606 supersedes nearly all U.S. GAAP on revenue recognition and eliminated industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services at an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. 
ASC 606 primarily impacted our revenue recognition for software arrangements and sales to two-tier distributors. In both areas, the new standard accelerates the recognition of revenue. 
We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once delivery and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.
See Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.

Allowances for Receivables and Sales Returns
A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of January 26, 2019 and July 28, 2018 was $92 million and $123 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected.

Loss Contingencies and Product Warranties
Impairment of Investments 
If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral.
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset Impairments
Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.

Restructuring and Other Charges
We initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2018 in order to realign our organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, with estimated pretax charges of approximately $600 million. In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $186 million and $264 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, respectively, and have incurred cumulative charges of $372 million since inception. We expect this restructuring plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2019.

Three Months Ended January 26, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended January 27, 2018
The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 15.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with 371.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, foreign withholding tax, and DTA re-measurement recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
Table of Contents 
The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 12.1% for the first six months of fiscal 2019 compared with 203.1% for the first six months of fiscal 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, foreign withholding tax, and DTA re-measurement recorded during the first six months of fiscal 2018.
Balance Sheet and Cash Flows
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments in the first six months of fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by cash returned to shareholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of $10.1 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of $3.0 billion; net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of $1.6 billion; and capital expenditures of $0.5 billion. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $7.6 billion and timing of settlements of investments and other of $1.6 billion.
In addition to cash requirements in the normal course of business, in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 on February 6, 2019, we closed the acquisition of Luxtera for a purchase price of approximately $0.7 billion in cash and assumed equity awards. Also approximately $0.7 billion of the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries is payable in less than one year. Additionally, $9.7 billion of long term debt which was outstanding at January 26, 2019 (of which $2.0 billion was repaid on February 15, 2019) and approximately $2 billion of commercial paper notes (issued in February 2019) will mature within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date. See further discussion of liquidity under “Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements” below.
We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below. 
Table of Contents 
We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. 
On February 13, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per common share to be paid on April 24, 2019 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 5, 2019. Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. 
On February 13, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a $15 billion increase to the stock repurchase program. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $24 billion, with no termination date. 
Our accounts receivable net, as of January 26, 2019 decreased by approximately 33%, as compared with the end of fiscal 2018, primarily due to product and service billings being more linear in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. 
Table of Contents 
Inventory as of January 26, 2019 decreased by 8% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2018. The decrease in inventory was due primarily to lower deferred cost of sales related to the adoption of ASC 606 in the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased 3% compared to the end of fiscal 2018. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 4% compared with the end of fiscal 2018. 
Financing Receivables Our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables decreased by 2%. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.
Table of Contents 
Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. 
The volume of channel partner financing was $14.5 billion and $13.6 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion as of January 26, 2019 and July 28, 2018, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of January 26, 2019, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $363 million, of which approximately $86 million was recorded as deferred revenue.
Borrowings
We repaid our senior notes due on February 15, 2019 for an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion upon maturity.
Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of January 26, 2019.
Table of Contents 
Commercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of January 26, 2019 and July 28, 2018. As of February 18, 2019, we had approximately $2 billion of commercial paper notes outstanding.
Deferred revenue decreased primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606 in the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019. Of the total deferred revenue decrease related to ASC 606 of $2.8 billion, $2.6 billion relates to deferred product revenue and $0.2 billion relates to deferred service revenue. Of the adjustment to deferred product revenue, $1.3 billion relates to our recurring software and subscription offers, $0.6 billion relates to two-tier distribution, and the remainder relates to non-recurring software and other adjustments. 
Operating Leases 
We lease office space in many U.S. locations. Outside the United States, larger leased sites include sites in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Poland and the United Kingdom. We also lease equipment and vehicles. The future minimum lease payments under all of our noncancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year as of January 26, 2019 were $1.2 billion.
Transition Tax Payable 
The income tax payable outstanding as of January 26, 2019 for the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries is $7.4 billion. Approximately $0.7 billion is payable in less than one year; $1.3 billion is payable between 1 to 3 years; $1.9 billion is payable between 3 to 5 years; and the remaining $3.5 billion is payable in more than 5 years. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Table of Contents 
Other Commitments
Other Funding Commitments We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our non-marketable equity and other investments, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $357 million as of January 26, 2019, compared with $223 million as of July 28, 2018.
We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”
Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements
Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On September 13, 2001, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program. On February 13, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a $15 billion increase to the stock repurchase program. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $24 billion, with no termination date.
For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of shares withheld to meet applicable tax withholding requirements. Although these withheld shares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and therefore are not included in the preceding table, they are treated as common stock repurchases in our financial statements as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting (see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
