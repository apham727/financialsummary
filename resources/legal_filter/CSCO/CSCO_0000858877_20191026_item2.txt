Forward-Looking Statements
Three Months Ended October 26, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended October 27, 2018
Total revenue increased by 1% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Within total revenue, product revenue was flat and service revenue increased by 3%. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019 we completed the sale of our SPVSS business. Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 2% not including revenue from the SPVSS business in the prior year period. Total gross margin increased by 2.0 percentage points, driven by productivity improvements and product mix, and to a lesser extent, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. Our gross margin also benefited from the sale of our lower margin SPVSS business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 3.1 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.9 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 12%, driven by a 18% decrease in net income and a decrease in diluted share count of 341 million shares. 
In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas increased $226 million and EMEA revenue increased by $59 million. Revenue in our APJC segment decreased by $197 million. The “BRICM” countries experienced a product revenue decline of 30% in the aggregate, driven by decreased product revenue in the emerging countries of Mexico, India, China, Russia and Brazil of 41%, 37%, 33%, 8% and 7%, respectively.
From a product category perspective, total product revenue, not including SPVSS products in the prior year period, increased 1% year over year. The increase was driven by solid product revenue growth in Security and Applications of 22% and 6%, respectively, and was offset by a product revenue decrease in Infrastructure Platforms of 1%. 
For additional discussion of our strategy and priorities, see Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 27, 2019.
Revenue Recognition 
We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.
We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.
Revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. 
See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.
Allowances for Receivables and Sales Returns
The allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. When evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. Determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.
A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019 was $85 million and $84 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. 
Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers
Loss Contingencies and Product Warranties
Impairment of Investments 
We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our available-for-sale debt investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.
If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral.
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset Impairments
Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.

Three Months Ended October 26, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended October 27, 2018
Americas
Product revenue in the Americas segment increased by 3%, led by growth in the public sector, commercial and enterprise markets, partially offset by a decline in the service provider market. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 4% in the United States while product revenue in Mexico, Brazil and Canada decreased by 41%, 7% and 6%, respectively.
Product revenue in the EMEA segment increased by 1%, with growth in the public sector and commercial markets partially offset by declines in the service provider and enterprise markets. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA increased by 3%, while product revenue for the remainder of the EMEA segment, which primarily consists of countries in Western Europe, increased by 1%.

Three Months Ended October 26, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended October 27, 2018
Infrastructure Platforms
The Infrastructure Platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless, and the data center. Infrastructure Platforms revenue decreased by 1%, or $84 million, with growth across the portfolio with the exception of routing. Switching had increased revenue, with revenue growth in campus switching driven by an increase in sales of our intent-based networking Catalyst 9000 Series, and with growth in the data center switching driven by increased revenue from our Nexus 9000 Series. We experienced a decrease in sales of routing products, driven by continued weakness in the service provider market. We experienced revenue growth from wireless products driven by Meraki offerings. Revenue from data center had solid growth driven by higher sales of our HyperFlex products.
Applications
The Applications product category includes our collaboration offerings (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence and conferencing) as well as the Internet of Things (IoT) and AppDynamics analytics software offerings. Revenue in our Applications product category increased by 6%, or $80 million, with growth across the businesses, including double digit growth in AppDynamics. 
Revenue in our Security product category increased 22%, or $145 million, driven by strong sales of our identity and access, advanced threat security, unified threat management and web security products. The acquisition of Duo Security in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 also contributed to the revenue increase in this product category.
Other Products
The decrease in revenue from our Other Products category was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from the SPVSS business which we divested in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
Service Revenue by Segment
Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. 
Three Months Ended October 26, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended October 27, 2018
Service revenue increased 3%, driven by an increase in software and solution support offerings. Service revenue not including the SPVSS business in the prior year period increased by 4%. Service revenue increased across all geographic segments.
Gross Margin
Product Gross Margin
 (1) Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere.

Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets
Three Months Ended October 26, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended October 27, 2018
The increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was due largely to the amortization of purchased intangibles from our recent acquisitions.
Restructuring and Other Charges
We initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2018 in order to realign our organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, with estimated pretax charges of $600 million. In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $184 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and have incurred cumulative charges of $614 million since inception. We do not expect to incur significant charges under this plan in the future and expect this plan to be substantially completed in the first half of fiscal 2020.
Operating Income

Interest and Other Income (Loss), Net
Three Months Ended October 26, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended October 27, 2018
Interest income decreased driven by a decrease in the average balance of cash and available-for-sale debt investments. The decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance. 
Three Months Ended October 26, 2019 Compared with Three Months Ended October 27, 2018
The total change in net gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt investments was primarily attributable to higher realized gains as a result of market conditions, and the timing of sales of these investments. The total change in net gains (losses) on marketable equity investments was attributable to market value fluctuations and the timing of recognition of gains and losses. The change in net gains (losses) on non-marketable equity and other investments was primarily due to higher net realized gains, partially offset by higher impairment charges. The change in other gains (losses), net was driven by higher gains from customer lease terminations, partially offset by higher donation expense and net unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.
The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 20.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with 9.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of a tax benefit relating to indirect effects from the adoption of ASC 606 at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019 and a decrease in foreign income taxed at lower than U.S. rates in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. 
The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by cash returned to shareholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of $0.8 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of $1.5 billion; net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of $0.2 billion; a net decrease in debt of $6.2 billion and capital expenditures of $0.2 billion. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $3.6 billion.
In addition to cash requirements in the normal course of business, on July 9, 2019 we announced our intent to acquire Acacia for a purchase consideration of approximately $2.6 billion in cash. In addition, approximately $0.7 billion of the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries is payable in less than one year. Also, $4.0 billion of long-term debt outstanding at October 26, 2019 will mature within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date. See further discussion of liquidity under “Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements” below.
We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below. 
Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.
We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. 
Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.
The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $12.7 billion, with no termination date. 
Our accounts receivable net, as of October 26, 2019 decreased by approximately 11%, as compared with the end of fiscal 2019, primarily due to timing and amount of product and service billings in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. 
Inventory as of October 26, 2019 decreased by 3% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2019. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to lower manufactured finished goods partially offset by an increase in raw materials.
We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. 
Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our 
Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased 9% compared to the end of fiscal 2019. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 7% compared with the end of fiscal 2019. 
Financing Receivables Our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables include sales-type leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables decreased by 2%. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.
Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. 
The volume of channel partner financing was $7.6 billion and $7.2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion as of October 26, 2019 and July 27, 2019, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of October 26, 2019, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $163 million, of which approximately $76 million was recorded as deferred revenue.
Borrowings
Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of October 26, 2019.
Commercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had $4.2 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 27, 2019. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of October 26, 2019.
Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased deferrals related to our recurring software offerings. The 2% decrease in deferred service revenue was driven by the impact of ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue.
Transition Tax Payable 
The income tax payable outstanding as of October 26, 2019 for the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries is $8.3 billion. Approximately $0.7 billion is payable in less than one year; $1.5 billion is payable between 1 to 3 years; $2.1 billion is payable between 3 to 5 years; and the remaining $4.0 billion is payable in more than 5 years. 
For our Contractual Obligations see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 27, 2019
Other Commitments
We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our non-marketable equity and other investments, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $311 million as of October 26, 2019, compared with $326 million as of July 27, 2019.
We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”
Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On September 13, 2001, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $12.7 billion, with no termination date.
For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of shares withheld to meet applicable tax withholding requirements. Although these withheld shares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and therefore are not included in the preceding table, they are treated as common stock repurchases in our financial statements as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
