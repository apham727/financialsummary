Forward-Looking Statements
We adopted ASC 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for impact of this adoption on our operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Three Months Ended October 27, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended October 28, 2017
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we saw broad-based growth across the business and delivered solid revenue growth, margins and operating cash flow. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. Our product revenue reflected solid growth in Infrastructure Platforms, Applications and Security, and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions. Notwithstanding the first quarter fiscal 2019 results, we continue to operate in a challenging and highly competitive environment. While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term. 
Total revenue increased by 8% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Within total revenue, product revenue increased by 9% and service revenue increased by 3%. Total gross margin increased by 1.1 percentage points, driven primarily by productivity improvements and the $122 million legal and indemnification settlement charge recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, decreased by 4.3 percentage points primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased due to a benefit from the $400 million litigation settlement with Arista. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 6.4 percentage points. The effective tax rate decreased 10.0 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share increased by 60%, driven by a 48% increase in net income and a decrease in diluted share count of 380 million shares. 
In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas increased $401 million, EMEA revenue increased by $315 million, and revenue in our APJC segment increased by $219 million. These increases reflect broad strength across several countries within these segments. The “BRICM” countries experienced product revenue growth of 24% in the aggregate, driven by increased product revenue in the emerging countries of Mexico, India, Russia and Brazil of 64%, 55%, 23% and 1%, respectively, while product revenue in China was flat.
From a product category perspective, we saw broad-based growth across the portfolio. The product revenue increase of 9% was driven by a 9% product revenue increase in Infrastructure Platforms and solid product revenue growth in Applications and Security, which grew by 18% and 11% respectively. 
For additional discussion of our strategy and priorities, see Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 28, 2018.
Revenue Recognition 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition. ASC 606 supersedes nearly all U.S. GAAP on revenue recognition and eliminated industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services at an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. 
ASC 606 primarily impacted our revenue recognition for software arrangements and sales to two-tier distributors. In both areas, the new standard accelerates the recognition of revenue. 
We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.
We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once delivery and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.
See Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.
Allowances for Receivables and Sales Returns
The allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. When evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. Determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.
A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018 was $112 million and $123 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. 
Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers
Loss Contingencies and Product Warranties
Impairment of Investments 
We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our available-for-sale debt investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.
If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral.
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset Impairments
Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.

Infrastructure Platforms
The Infrastructure Platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless, and the data center. Infrastructure Platforms revenue increased by 9%, or $662 million, with strength across the portfolio. Switching had solid growth, with solid revenue growth in campus switching driven by an increase in sales of our intent-based networking Catalyst 9000 Series, and with revenue growth in data center switching driven by increased revenue from our Nexus 9000 Series. Routing returned to growth driven by growth in the service provider market. We experienced double digit revenue growth from wireless products driven by our Wave 2 offerings as well as Meraki. Our revenue from data center increased driven by higher sales of server products and our hyperconverged data center offering, HyperFlex. 
Applications
The Applications product category includes our collaboration offerings (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence and conferencing) as well as the Internet of Things (IoT) and analytics software offerings from Jasper and AppDynamics, respectively.

Share-Based Compensation Expense
Three Months Ended October 27, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended October 28, 2017
The increase in share-based compensation expense was due primarily to higher restructuring charges. 
Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets
Three Months Ended October 27, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended October 28, 2017
Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased due to SPVSS purchased intangibles which were held for sale, partially offset by amortization from our recent acquisitions.
Restructuring and Other Charges
We initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2018 in order to realign our organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, with estimated pretax charges of approximately $300 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expanded the restructuring plan to include an additional $300 million of estimated additional pretax charges. In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $78 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and have incurred cumulative charges of $186 million since inception. We expect this restructuring plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2019.
We incurred restructuring and other charges of $152 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 in connection with the restructuring plan announced in August 2016. 
Operating Income

Interest and Other Income (Loss), Net
Three Months Ended October 27, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended October 28, 2017
Interest income decreased, driven by a decrease in the average balance of available-or-sale debt investments. The decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance, partially offset by the impact of higher effective interest rates. 
Three Months Ended October 27, 2018 Compared with Three Months Ended October 28, 2017
The total change in net gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt investments and marketable equity investments was primarily attributable to higher realized losses as a result of market conditions, and the timing of sales of these investments.
The change in net gains (losses) on non-marketable equity and other investments was primarily due to lower realized gains, partially offset by higher unrealized gains and lower impairment charges.
The change in other gains (losses), net was primarily driven by lower gains from customer lease terminations.
The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 9.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with 19.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, a net 10.0 percentage point decrease for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease of the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 to 21% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as the result of enactment of Tax Act and the recognition of a $152 million tax benefit relating to indirect effects from the adoption of ASC 606 at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by cash returned to shareholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of $5.1 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of $1.5 billion; net cash paid for acquisitions of $2.0 billion; and capital expenditures of $0.2 billion. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $3.8 billion and timing of settlements of investments and other of $1.4 billion.
We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below. 
Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation  As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.
We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. 
Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. 
On February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a $25 billion increase to the stock repurchase program. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $14.0 billion, with no termination date. We expect to utilize this remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases over the next 9 to 15 months. 
Our accounts receivable net, as of October 27, 2018 decreased by approximately 18%, as compared with the end of fiscal 2018, primarily due to the amount and timing of service billings, and also due to product billings being more linear in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. 
Inventory as of October 27, 2018 decreased by 15% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2018. The decrease in inventory was due primarily to lower deferred cost of sales related to the adoption of ASC 606 in the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. 
Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was flat compared to the end of fiscal 2018. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 3% compared with the end of fiscal 2018. 
Financing Receivables Our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables decreased by 3%. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.
Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. 
The volume of channel partner financing was $7.2 billion and $6.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $931 million and $953 million as of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of October 27, 2018, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $335 million, of which approximately $98 million was recorded as deferred revenue.
Borrowings
Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of October 27, 2018.
Commercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of October 27, 2018 and July 28, 2018.
Deferred revenue decreased primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606 in the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019. Of the total deferred revenue decrease related to ASC 606 of $2.8 billion, $2.6 billion relates to deferred product revenue and $0.2 billion relates to deferred service revenue. Of the adjustment to deferred product revenue, $1.3 billion relates to our recurring software and subscription offers, $0.6 billion relates to two-tier distribution, and the remainder relates to non-recurring software and other adjustments. 
Operating Leases 
We lease office space in many U.S. locations. Outside the United States, larger leased sites include sites in Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Poland and the United Kingdom. We also lease equipment and vehicles. The future minimum lease payments under all of our noncancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year as of October 27, 2018 were $1.2 billion.
Transition Tax Payable 
Other Commitments
Other Funding Commitments We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our non-marketable equity and other investments, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $378 million as of October 27, 2018, compared with $223 million as of July 28, 2018.
We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”
Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On September 13, 2001, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program. On February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a $25 billion increase to the stock repurchase program. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $14.0 billion, with no termination date.
For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of shares withheld to meet applicable tax withholding requirements. Although these withheld shares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and therefore are not included in the preceding table, they are treated as common stock repurchases in our financial statements as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting (see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
