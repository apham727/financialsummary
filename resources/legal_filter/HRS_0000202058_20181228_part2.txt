PART II.
OTHER INFORMATION



Item 1.
Legal Proceedings.
General.
We record accruals for losses related to those matters against us that we consider to be probable and that can be reasonably estimated.
Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized and legal costs generally are expensed when incurred.
Based on available information, in the opinion of management, settlements, arbitration awards and final judgments, if any, that are considered probable of being rendered against us in litigation or arbitration in existence at December 28, 2018 are reserved against or would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Merger Litigation.
As described in Note R — Legal Proceedings and Contingencies in the Notes, in connection with our pending merger with L3 (see Note S — Pending Merger in the Notes for additional information), two putative class action lawsuits and one individual lawsuit were filed against the L3 Parties in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York between December 19, 2018 and January 15, 2019, and a third putative class action lawsuit, Kent v. L3 Technologies, Inc., et al., was filed against the L3 Parties and the Harris Parties in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 4, 2019.
The complaints in the lawsuits contain substantially similar allegations contending, among other things, that the registration statement on Form S-4 in support of the pending merger misstates or fails to disclose certain allegedly material information in violation of federal securities laws.
The complaint in the Kent lawsuit further alleges that the Harris Parties are liable for these violations as “controlling persons” of L3 within the meaning of federal securities laws.
The complaints in all four lawsuits generally seek injunctive relief enjoining the merger, damages and costs, among other remedies.
Additional lawsuits in connection with the merger may be filed in the future.
These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently resolved with the authorities or ultimately through legal proceedings.
Item 1A.
Risk Factors.
“Risk Factors” in our Fiscal 2018 Form 10-K.
Except as set forth below in this Item 1A.
In addition to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Fiscal 2018 Form 10-K, the following are risks related to our pending all-stock merger of equals with L3, which is discussed in Note S — Pending Merger in the Notes: 



•Because the exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either our or L3’s stock price, the value of the shares of the combined company is uncertain.
•The market price for shares of common stock of the combined company following the completion of the merger may be affected by factors different from, or in addition to, those that historically have affected or currently affect the market prices of shares of our common stock and L3 common stock.
•The shares of common stock of the combined company to be received by L3 stockholders as a result of the merger will have rights different from the shares of L3 common stock.
38



•Our stockholders and L3 stockholders will each have reduced ownership and voting interest in and will exercise less influence over management of the combined company.
•Until the completion of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, we and L3 are each prohibited from entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or L3 and our respective stockholders.
•Obtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may prevent or delay completion of the merger.
•The merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be consummated.
•The termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact us or L3.
•The directors and executive officers of us and L3 have interests and arrangements that may be different from, or in addition to, those of our and L3 stockholders generally.
•We or L3 may waive one or more of the closing conditions without re-soliciting stockholder approval.
•The merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might be willing to pay more to acquire or merge with either us or L3.
•We and L3 each will incur significant transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs in connection with the merger.
•Our stockholders and L3 stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the merger.
•Litigation filed against the L3 Parties and the Harris Parties could prevent or delay the consummation of the merger or result in the payment of damages following completion of the merger.
•The failure to successfully combine the businesses of us and L3 may adversely affect the combined company’s future results.
•The combined company may not be able to retain customers or suppliers or customers or suppliers may seek to modify contractual obligations with the combined company, which could have an adverse effect on the combined company’s business and operations.
•The combined company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the combined company’s business and operations.
•Combining the businesses of us and L3 may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, which may adversely affect the combined company’s business results and negatively affect the value of the common stock of the combined company following the merger.
Specifically, the unaudited pro forma combined financial data does not reflect the effect of any divestitures that may be required in connection with the merger.
•The revenue of the combined company will depend on our and L3’s ability to maintain certain levels of government business.
•Third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships with us or L3.
•The combined company may be unable to retain our and L3 personnel successfully after the merger is completed.
•The combined company’s debt may limit its financial flexibility.
•Declaration, payment and amounts of dividends, if any, distributed to stockholders of the combined company

will be uncertain.
These risks are discussed more fully in the registration statement on Form S-4 we filed with the SEC on December 14, 2018 that includes our and L3’s joint proxy statement that also constitutes our prospectus.
Although the registration statement has not yet been declared effective, we urge you to read it and any amendments and supplements thereto, because they contain important information about the pending merger, including relevant risk factors.
