Overview



We provide mission-focused technology solutions and services for U.S. defense, intelligence community and federal civilian agencies.
We excel in full-spectrum cyber, data collection & analytics, enterprise information technology (IT), systems and software engineering solutions that support national and homeland security.
As of February 15, 2019, all agencies of the U.S. federal government have funding through appropriations through Government fiscal year (GFY) 2019.
Approximately 75% of the U.S. government including the Department of Defense had full year appropriations to begin the fiscal year.
Appropriations for the Department of Defense include near term expansions that aligned with the Administration's stated priorities in dealing with significant global threats, readiness and force structure needs within the military, diplomatic, and cyber aggressions by both state and non-state actors.
A number of federal civilian agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security and State operated under a Continuing Resolution through late December and then endured a 35-day lapse in funding prior to receiving appropriations in mid-February.
We expect future appropriations to be debated with the consideration of policy priorities, national budget deficits, debt ceilings and the Budget Control Act.
We recommend that you read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Revenue



The primary driver of our increase in revenues relates to revenue from new contract awards and growth on certain existing contracts, which were offset by contracts and tasks that ended and reduced scope of work on some contracts.
20



Cost of services 



The increase in cost of services was primarily due to increases in revenue.
As a percentage of revenue, direct labor costs were 48% for both the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
As a percentage of revenues, other direct costs, which include subcontractors and third party equipment and materials used in the performance of our contracts, was 38% for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to 37% for the same period in 2018.
We expect general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue to increase during the remainder of 2019 due to the acquisition of Kforce Government Solutions (KGS) and increased bid and proposal spending.
Interest expense



The decrease in interest expense was due to repayment of debt on our revolving line of credit.
We expect interest expense to increase for the remainder of 2019 due to increased borrowings under our credit facility to fund the acquisition of KGS.
For additional information, see Note 11 in our condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1.
It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year-to-year.
Our effective income tax rates were 25% and 22% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Backlog



Backlog represents estimates that we calculate on a consistent basis.
A variety of circumstances or events may cause changes in the amount of our backlog and funded backlog, including the execution of new contracts, the extension of existing contracts, the non-renewal or completion of current contracts, the early termination of contracts and adjustment to estimates for previously included contracts.
Changes in the amount of our funded backlog also are affected by the funding cycles of the U.S. government.
At both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our backlog was $8.4 billion.
Our funded backlog was $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.
The following table reconciles our backlog to our remaining performance obligations as disclosed in Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 (in billions):

Liquidity and Capital Resources



Our primary liquidity needs relate to managing working capital, financing acquisitions, making cash dividend payments, purchasing property and equipment and investing in capital software.
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
On March 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $120.5 million.
There were outstanding borrowings of $96.0 million under our revolving credit facility at March 31, 2019.
The maximum available borrowings under our revolving credit facility at March 31, 2019 were $396.3 million.
Cash Flows From (Used In) Operating Activities



Our operating cash flow is primarily affected by our ability to invoice and collect from our customers in a timely manner, our management of vendor payments and the overall profitability of our contracts.
We bill most of our customers monthly after services are rendered.
Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding were 70 and 69 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, our net cash from (used in) operating activities was $47.3 million and $(18.0) million, respectively.
The increase in net cash flows from operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to the timing of receivables collection.
Cash Flows From (Used In) Investing Activities



For the three months ended March 31, 2019 our net cash used in investing activities was $10.2 million, which was primarily due to the purchase of equipment to support a managed IT service contract, infrastructure investments and capitalized software for internal use.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018 our net cash used in investing activities was $9.0 million, which was primarily due to the purchase of equipment to support a managed IT service contract, infrastructure investments and capitalized software for internal use.
Cash Flows From (Used in) Financing Activities



For the three months ended March 31, 2019, our net cash flow from financing activities was $78.1 million, which was primarily due to net borrowings under revolving credit facility and dividend payments.
The net increase in borrowings for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is due to funding requirements to acquire Kforce Government Solutions on April 1, 2019.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, our net cash flow from financing activities were $27.9 million, which were primarily due to net borrowings under our revolving credit facility and exercise of stock options partially offset by dividend payments.
Revolving Credit Facility



We maintain a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as sole administrative agent.
The credit agreement provides for a $500 million revolving credit facility, with a $75 million letter of credit sublimit and a $30 million swing line loan sublimit.
The credit agreement also includes an accordion feature that permits us to arrange with the lenders for the provision of additional commitments.
The maturity date is August 17, 2022.
Borrowings under our credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all the assets of us and our Material Subsidiaries (as defined in the credit agreement) and bear interest at one of the following variable rates as selected by us at the time of borrowing: a London Interbank Offer Rate based rate plus market spreads (1.25% to 2.25% based on our consolidated total leverage ratio) or Bank of America's base rate plus market spreads (0.25% to 1.25% based on our consolidated total leverage ratio).
There were outstanding borrowings of $96.0 million on our revolving credit facility at March 31, 2019.
As of and during the three months ended March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement.
We anticipate financing our internal and external growth through cash from operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facility or other debt and issuance of equity.
Under our investment policy, we manage our investments in accordance with the priorities of maintaining the safety of 



 22



our principal, maintaining the liquidity of our investments, maximizing the yield on our investments and investing our cash to the fullest extent possible.
Our investment policy provides that no investment security can have a final maturity that exceeds six months and that the weighted average maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed 60 days.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks and short-term investments with maturity dates of three months or less at the date of purchase.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



In the ordinary course of business, we use letters of credit issued to satisfy certain contractual terms with our customers.
As of March 31, 2019, $7.7 million in letters of credit were issued but undrawn.
We have an outstanding performance bond in connection with a contract between ManTech MENA, LLC and Jadwalean International Operations and Management Company to fulfill technical support requirements for the Royal Saudi Air Force.
This performance bond is guaranteed by a letter of credit in the amount of $14 thousand.
Our significant accounting policies for 2018 are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, previously filed with the SEC.
Lease Accounting



We determine if a contract is or contains a lease at inception.
In making this determination, we consider all relevant facts and circumstances.
We reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease only if the terms and conditions of the contract are changed.
We account for lease components and nonlease components associated with a lease as a single lease component.
Operating leases are included in Operating lease ROU assets, Operating lease liabilitiesâ€”current and Operating lease liabilitiesâ€”long term on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Our ROU asset is recognized as the lease liability, any initial indirect costs and any prepaid lease payments, less any lease incentives.
Our lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date.
Our variable lease payments are excluded in measuring ROU asset and lease liability because they do not depend on an index or a rate or are not in substance fixed payments.
We exclude lease incentives and initial direct cost incurred from our lease payments.
23



For operating leases, after lease commencement, we measure our lease liability for each period at the present value of any remaining lease payments, discounted by using the rate determined at lease commencement.
In our condensed consolidated statement of income, we recognize a single operating lease expense calculated on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term.
The amortization of the ROU asset increases each year as a result of the declining lease liability balance.
Variable lease payments are not recognized in the measurement of the lease liability - they are recognized in the period in which the related obligation has been incurred.
For finance leases, after lease commencement, we measure our lease liability by using the effective interest rate method.
In each period, the lease liability will be increased to reflect the interest that is accrued on the related lease liability by using the appropriate discount rate, offset by a decrease in the lease liability resulting from the periodic lease payments.
We recognize the ROU asset at cost, reduced by any accumulated depreciation.
The ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis.
Together, the interest expense and amortization expense result in a front-loaded expense profile.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Updates



ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) supersedes the leases requirements in Topic 840, Leases.
We elected to adopt using the modified retrospective method at the beginning of the period of adoption, January 1, 2019, through the recognition of a lease liability and corresponding right of use asset.
We elected the following transition related practical expedients; not to reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, not to reassess lease classification as determined under ASC 840 and, not to reassess initial direct costs for any existing lease.
We have also elected not to apply the recognition and measurement requirements to short-term leases (less than 1 year).
Additional details are included in Note 4 in our condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1.
We elected to adopt this ASU at the beginning of the period of adoption, January 1, 2019.
Recently Issued But Not Yet Adopted ASUs



The FASB has issued ASU 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606, which resolves the diversity in practice concerning the manner in which entities account for transactions on the basis of their view of the economics of the collaborative arrangement.
A collaborative arrangement, as defined by the guidance in Topic 808, is a contractual arrangement under which two or more parties actively participate in a joint operating activity and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the activityâ€™s commercial success.
In particular, the amendments in ASU 2018-18 (1) clarify that certain transactions between collaborative participants should be accounted for as revenue under Topic 606 when the collaborative participant is a customer in the context of the unit of account, and that, in those situations, all the guidance in Topic 606 should be applied, including recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements; (2) add unit-of-account guidance in Topic 808 to align with the guidance in Topic 606 (i.e., a distinct good or service), limited to when an entity is assessing whether the collaborative arrangement or a part of the arrangement is within the scope of Topic 606; and (3) clarify that in a transaction that is not directly related to sales to third parties, presenting the transaction as revenue would be precluded if the collaborative participant counterparty was not a customer.
The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.
Note that early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for public business entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued.
We are currently evaluating the effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
The amendments in ASU 2018-13 modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement.
Specifically, the amendments in this ASU remove disclosure requirements in Topic 820 related to (1) the amount of, and reasons for, transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; (2) the policy for timing of transfers between levels; (3) the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements; and (4) for non-public entities, the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in earnings for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period.
The ASU also modifies disclosure requirements such that (1) in place of a rollforward for Level 3 fair value measurements, a non-public entity is required to disclose transfers into and out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 



 24



and purchases and issues of Level 3 assets and liabilities; (2) for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value, an entity is required to disclose the timing of liquidation of an investeeâ€™s assets and the date that restrictions from redemption might lapse, only if the investee has communicated the timing to the entity or announced the timing publicly; and (3) it is clear that the measurement uncertainty disclosure is to communicate information about the uncertainty in measurement as of the reporting date.
Additionally, the ASU adds disclosure requirements for public entities about (1) the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period, and (2) the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements.
The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.
The amendments regarding changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption.
All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date.
Note that early application is permitted for all entities; moreover, an entity is allowed to early adopt any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance of this ASU and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date.
As part of its disclosure framework project, the FASB has issued ASU 2018-14, Compensationâ€”Retirement Benefitsâ€”Defined Benefit Plansâ€”General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Frameworkâ€”Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, which modify the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans.
Finally, the amendments in this ASU clarify disclosure requirements in Paragraph 715-20-50-3.
The amendments are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020.
We are currently evaluating the effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
The FASB has issued ASU 2018-15, Intangiblesâ€”Goodwill and Otherâ€”Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customerâ€™s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force), which aims to reduce complexity in the accounting for costs of implementing a cloud computing service arrangement.
In fact, ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license).
Accordingly, the amendments in this ASU require an entity (customer) in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to follow the guidance in Subtopic 350-40, Intangiblesâ€”Goodwill and Otherâ€”Internal-Use Software, in order to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense.
Additionally, the amendments in this ASU require the entity (customer) to expense the capitalized implementation costs of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract over the term of the hosting arrangement (i.e., the noncancellable period of the arrangement plus periods covered by (1) an option to extend the arrangement if the customer is reasonably certain to exercise that option, (2) an option to terminate the arrangement if the customer is reasonably certain not to exercise the termination option and (3) an option to extend (or not to terminate) the arrangement in which exercise of the option is in the control of the vendor.
The amendments in this ASU also require the entity to present the expense related to the capitalized implementation costs in the same line item in the statement of income as the fees associated with the hosting element (service) of the arrangement, and to classify payments for capitalized implementation costs in the statement of cash flows in the same manner as payments made for fees associated with the hosting element.
Note that the accounting for the service element of a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is not affected by the amendments in this ASU.
The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.
We are currently evaluating methods of adoption as well as the effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
The FASB has issued ASU 2018-17, Consolidation (Topic 810): Targeted Improvements to Related Party Guidance for Variable Interest Entities, which reduces the cost and complexity of financial reporting associated with consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs).
Specially, the indirect interests held through related parties in common control arrangements should be considered on a proportional basis (as opposed to a direct interest in its entirety) for determining whether fees paid to decision makers and service providers are variable interests.
This is consistent with how indirect interests held through related parties under common control are considered for determining whether a reporting entity must consolidate a VIE.
The amendments are effective 



 25



for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.
We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
The FASB has issued ASU 2018-07, Compensationâ€”Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting which supersedes the guidance in Subtopic 505-50, Equityâ€”Equity-Based Payments to Non- Employees.
In particular, ASU 2018-07 expands the scope of Topic 718, Compensationâ€”Stock Compensation (which previously only included payments to employees), to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees.
In fact, an entity should now apply the requirements of Topic 718 to non-employee awards, except for specific guidance on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost (i.e., the period of time over which share-based payment awards vest and the pattern of cost recognition over that period).
Additionally, the amendments specify that Topic 718 applies to all share-based payment transactions in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in the grantorâ€™s own operations by issuing share-based payment awards, and clarify that Topic 718 does not apply to share-based payments used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020.
Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period, for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued.
We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
The FASB has issued ASU 2017-04, Intangiblesâ€”Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the manner in which an entity determines the amount of a goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unitâ€™s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity, prior to the amendments in ASU 2017-04, had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities, including unrecognized assets and liabilities, in accordance with the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
Under the amendments in this ASU, an entity should (1) perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and (2) recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unitâ€™s fair value, with the understanding that the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
Public entities should adopt the amendments in this ASU prospectively for their annual, or any interim periods, in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
Early adoption is permitted for all entities for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
We will evaluate adopting when we perform our goodwill impairment test in 2019.
We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
