During the third quarter ended June 30, 2018, CSPi's Board of Directors approved the sale of the Germany subsidiary of its TS segment. The Germany assets and liabilities are reflected as "held-for-sale" on the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with ASC 360, at June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017. In addition, the results of operations for the Germany business have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Company closed on the sale of the German subsidiary of its TS segment on July 31, 2018.
 Our revenues decreased by approximately $6.4 million, or 24%, to $20.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $26.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in revenue is the result of a decrease of $6.2 million in our TS segment, combined with a $0.2 million decrease in our HPP segment. Our gross margin percentage increased to 26% of revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2018 from 23% for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Operating income decreased by approximately $1.1 million from operating income of $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 to operating income of $222 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily as a result of a $939 thousand decrease in gross profit combined with an increase of $181 thousand in operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of higher compensation costs with an increase in the number of engineers and outside consultants for the development of the new Aria security products in the HPP segment. Our income tax expense decreased by approximately $144 thousand to $249 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to an income tax expense of $393 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease to the income tax expense was primarily due to the decrease in operating income.
 Our revenues decreased by approximately $6.4 million to $20.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $26.4 million of revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017. TS segment revenues decreased by $6.2 million, and HPP segment revenues decreased by $0.2 million. 
 The HPP product revenues of $1.7 million were relatively unchanged for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017, increasing by $30 thousand from $1.6 million. The decrease in HPP services revenues of $258 thousand is primarily attributed to a $382 thousand decrease in royalties on high-speed processing boards related to the E2D program shipped for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017. 
The decrease in TS segment product revenues of $7.0 million during the period was primarily the result of a decrease in product revenues of $7.2 million in our U.S. division, partially offset by an increase of $0.2 million in our U.K. division. The $7.2 million decrease in the U.S. division was primarily the result of product sales to a major customer in the prior year 
that were not repeated in the current year. The $0.2 million increase in the U.K. division product revenues was primarily the result of increased product shipments to two customers. The decrease in TS segment product revenues was partially offset by an increase in TS segment service revenues of $0.9 million during the period. The increase in TS segment service revenues for the period ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the prior fiscal year three month period was due primarily to an increase of $0.9 million in our U.S. division. The $0.9 million increase in the U.S. division service revenues was substantially the result of a $0.8 million increase in internal services and a $0.3 million increase in managed service contracts, partially offset by a decrease in third party maintenance revenues of $0.2 million.
 Our gross margin ("GM") decreased by $0.9 million to $5.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to a gross margin of approximately $6.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The GM as a percentage of revenue increased to 26% for the three months ended June 30, 2018, from 23% for the three months ended June 30, 2017.
The overall HPP segment gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 69% for the three months ended June 30, 2018 from 73% for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The 4% decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales in the HPP segment was primarily attributed to a decrease in high margin royalty revenues and a reduction in higher margin multicomputer products within the overall product mix.
 The overall TS segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 18% for the three month period ended June 30, 2018 from 16% for the three month period ended June 30, 2017. The overall TS segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increase was primarily due to increased higher margin service revenues combined with decreased lower margin product revenues by our TS segment U.S. division.
The engineering and development expenses incurred by our HPP segment were $0.9 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The current period expenses were primarily for product engineering expenses incurred in connection with the development of the new ARIA security products. The increased engineering and development expenses for the three month period ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three month period ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributed to an increase in engineering headcount related expenses combined with increased consulting costs.
The net change to other income (expenses) of $475 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2017, was primarily driven by the net change of approximately $446 thousand in the foreign exchange gain (loss) on foreign currency holdings in the current period as compared to the prior year period, partially offset by changes in other income of $33 thousand. 
The following table is a summary of the operating results of the Germany division of our TS segment which have been reflected as discontinued operations. See Note 12 for additional information.
Our revenues decreased by approximately $6.9 million, or 11%, to $53.3 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $60.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in overall revenue for the nine month period ended June 30, 2018 as compared to prior fiscal year nine month period was substantially the result of an approximately $2.1 million decrease in our HPP segment revenue combined with a decrease of approximately $4.7 million in our TS segment. The HPP segment revenue was primarily impacted by lower royalties recognized of approximately $1.9 million on high-speed processing boards during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $3.7 million of royalty revenues for the nine month period ended June 30, 2017. The TS segment revenue was primarily impacted by reduced product sales to a major customer of our U.S. division in the prior year that were not repeated in the current year. Our overall gross margin percentage increased from 24% of revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2017, to 25% for the nine months ended June 30, 2018. Our operating income decreased by approximately $2.2 million resulting in an operating loss of $0.5 million for the nine month period ended June 30, 2018 as compared to operating income of $1.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2017, primarily as a result of decreased gross profit related to the decreased revenues, increased selling and marketing expenses and increased engineering expenses. Our income tax expense increased by approximately $686 thousand to an income tax expense of $1.2 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to an income tax expense of $539 thousand for the nine months ended June 30, 2017. The increase to the income tax expense was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017.
 Our total revenues decreased by $6.9 million to $53.3 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared $60.1 million of revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2017. 
The decrease in HPP product revenues for the period of $0.4 million was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately $1.0 million in Multicomputer product line shipments, partially due to a large shipment in the prior fiscal year period, partially offset by an increase in Myricom product line shipments of $0.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in HPP services revenues of $1.7 million for the period was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately $1.8 million in royalty revenues on high-speed processing boards related to the E2D program during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2017. 
The decrease in TS segment product revenues of $7.8 million during the period was primarily the result of a decrease in product revenues of $8.5 million in our U.S. division, partially offset by an increase in product revenues of $0.7 million in our U.K division. The $8.5 million decrease in the U.S. division product revenues was primarily the result of product sales to a major customer in the prior year that were not repeated in the current year. The increase in TS segment service revenues of $3.1 million during the period was primarily the result of an increase of $3.1 million in our U.S. division which was substantially due to $1.8 million of increased internal services, $0.8 million of increased managed service contract revenues and increased third party maintenance revenues of $0.5 million.
The $6.9 million decrease in total revenues is primarily attributed to a $4.8 million decrease by our TS segment combined with a $2.1 million decrease by our HPP segment. The $5.4 million decrease in the Americas revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily due to decreased revenues by our TS segment of approximately $4.1 million, combined with decreased sales by our HPP segment of approximately $1.3 million. The $1.3 million decrease in Asia is primarily the result of decreased product sales by our HPP segment to a major customer of approximately $1.0 million, combined with decreased sales by our TS segment of $0.3 million. The $0.2 million decrease in Europe revenue is primarily due to decreased sales by our TS segment.
Engineering and development expenses increased by $0.6 million to $2.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to $1.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2017. The current period expenses were primarily for  product engineering expenses incurred in connection with the development of the new ARIA security products. The increased engineering and development expenses for the nine month period ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the nine month period ended June 30, 2017 is primarily attributed to an increase in engineering headcount and consulting related expenses.
The increase to other income (expenses) for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2017 was primarily driven by the net change of approximately $0.3 million in the foreign exchange gain (loss) on foreign currency holdings in the current period as compared to the corresponding prior year period. 
The following table is a summary of the operating results of the Germany division of our TS segment which have been reflected as discontinued operations. See Note 12 for additional information.
Our primary source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents, which was unchanged at $10.4 million as of June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017. 
Significant sources of cash for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 included a decrease in accounts receivable of $3.9 million, an increase of $1.1 million from our discontinued operations, and an increase in deferred revenues of $0.8 million.
Significant uses of cash for the nine months ended June 30, 2018 included an increase in inventories of $4.1 million, a net loss of $1.8 million, and dividends paid of $1.3 million. 
Based on our current plans, business conditions and cash received from the sale of our German operations (see Note 13), management believes that the Company’s available cash and cash equivalents, the cash generated from operations and availability on our lines of credit will be sufficient to provide for the Company’s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2018. Our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team supervised and participated in this evaluation. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment 
As previously disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended September 30, 2017, our management identified a material weakness as of such date. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be able to be prevented or detected in a timely basis. The identified material weakness is in connection with our controls over the revenue recognition process at our foreign subsidiaries, specifically whether revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied prior to recognizing revenue and the failure to sufficiently assess gross versus net revenue indicators to certain revenue transactions. We determined that controls over the revenue recognition process were not operating effectively and the resulting control gap amounted to a material weakness in our controls over financial reporting.
During the periods following our initial identification of the material weakness referred to above, management assessed various alternatives to remediate this material weakness and we implemented changes to our system of internal controls, which included the implementation of enhanced internal auditing procedures, whereby revenue transactions are subjected to an additional review process at the corporate level to ensure the correct accounting methodology is applied to all revenue transactions. During the three months ended June 30, 2018, management continued to take actions to improve accounting operations in our European divisions and also announced a transaction to sell our Germany subsidiary. Although we have implemented such changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as described above, at this time, we cannot conclude that the material weakness has been remediated and we will continue to evaluate personnel changes and upgrade systems and processes throughout fiscal year 2018 as necessary.
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
