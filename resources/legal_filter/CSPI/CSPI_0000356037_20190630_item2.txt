 Overview of the three months ended June 30, 2019  
 Our revenues increased by approximately $1.6 million, or 8%, to $21.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $20.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in revenue is the result of an increase of $2.5 million in our TS segment, offset with a $0.9 million decrease in our HPP segment. Our gross margin percentage decreased to 22% of revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2019 from 26% for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Operating income decreased by approximately $0.1 million from operating income of $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 to operating income of $0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, primarily as a result decrease in gross margin percentage as a percent of revenue partially offset by a decrease in engineering and development expenses of $0.3 million. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of $0.2 million decrease in our HPP segment. Our provision for income tax was a tax benefit of $326 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to a tax expense of $249 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The effective tax benefit rate for the current quarter is 158%. The high effective tax rate was due in part to no tax expense recorded for U.K. income due to a large pension contribution, adjustments of taxes payable and reconciliation of tax provision to the prior year tax returns and the benefit of the research and development credit.   
 Revenues  
 Our revenues increased by approximately $1.6 million to $21.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $20.0 million of revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2018. TS segment revenues increased by $2.5 million, and HPP segment revenues decreased by $0.9 million.  
 The HPP product revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2019 of $1.6 million, decreased by $0.1 million from $1.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, primarily as a result of a decrease in Myricom product sales. The decrease in HPP services revenues of $0.9 million is primarily attributed to a $0.8 million decrease in royalties on high-speed processing boards related to the E2D program shipped for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018.  
 The increase in TS segment product revenues of $2.1 million during the period was primarily the result of an increase in product revenues of $3.3 million in our U.S. division, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease of product revenue in our U.K. division. The $3.3 million increase in the U.S. division was primarily the result of increased product sales to one major customer. The $1.2 million decrease in the U.K. division product revenues was primarily the result of several large orders in the prior year that were not repeated in the current year. There was an increase in TS segment service revenues of $0.4 million during the period. This was primarily due to a $0.5 million increase in the U.S. division service revenues partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in the U.K. division. The U.S. division service revenues $0.5 million increase was substantially the result of a $0.2 million increase in managed service contracts, an increase in third party maintenance and services revenues of $0.6 million, partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in internal services.  
 The $3.0 million increase in revenue to the Americas is primarily the result of increased sales by our TS segment of $4.5 million partially offset by decreased sales by our HPP segment of $1.5 million. The $2.3 million decrease in revenue to Europe is primarily the result of decreased sales by our TS segment of $2.2 million. The $0.8 million increase in revenue to Asia is primarily the result of increased sales by our HPP segment of Myricom product to a major customer.  
 Gross Margins  
 Our gross margin ("GM") decreased by $0.4 million to $4.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to a gross margin of approximately $5.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The GM as a percentage of revenue decreased to 22% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, from 26% for the three months ended June 30, 2018.  
 The overall HPP segment gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 56% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 from 69% for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The 13% decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales in the HPP segment was primarily attributed to a $0.8 million decrease in high margin royalty revenues within the overall product mix.  
 The overall TS segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 19% for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 from 18% for the three month period ended June 30, 2018. The overall TS segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increase was primarily due to an increased margin as a percentage of sales in services for both the U.S. and U.K division partially offset by a decreased margin as a percentage of sales in products in the U.S. and U.K. division.  
 Operating Expenses  
 Engineering and Development Expenses  
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  
 The decrease in other income (expense) of $397 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily driven by a decrease in the foreign exchange gain.

 Overview of the nine months ended June 30, 2019  
 Our revenues increased by approximately $3.6 million, or 7%, to $56.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $53.3 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in overall revenue for the nine month period ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year nine month period was substantially the result of an approximately $5.2 million increase in our TS segment revenue, partially offset by an approximately $1.6 million decrease in our HPP segment revenue. The TS segment revenue for the nine month period ended June 30, 2019 was primarily impacted by the fulfillment of several large product orders in the U.S. division and increased volume in services revenue. The HPP segment revenue for the nine month period ended June 30, 2019 was primarily impacted by lower royalties recognized of approximately $1.4 million on high-speed processing boards during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the nine month period ended June 30, 2018. Our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 23% of revenue for the nine month period ended June 30, 2019 from 25% of revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2018. Our operating loss increased by approximately $0.1 million resulting in an operating loss of $0.6 million for the nine month period ended June 30, 2019 as compared to operating loss of $0.5 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily as a result of decreased gross margin partially offset by a decrease in engineering expenses of approximately $0.3 million and a decrease in selling and marketing expenses of $0.2 million for the nine month period ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior year period. Our income tax expense decreased by approximately $1.7 million to an income tax benefit of $0.5 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. The income tax provision for the nine month period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the prior year.  
 Revenues  
 Our total revenues increased by approximately $3.6 million to $56.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $53.3 million of revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2018.  
 The HPP product revenues were relatively unchanged at approximately $4.7 million for the nine month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. The decrease in HPP services revenues of approximately $1.5 million for the period was primarily the result of a decrease in royalty revenues on high-speed processing boards related to the E2D program during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018.  
 The increase in TS segment product revenues of $3.6 million during the period was the result of an increase in product revenues of $4.6 million in our U.S. division partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in our U.K division. The $4.6 million increase in the U.S. division product revenues was the result of several completed large product orders and the $1.0 million decrease in the U.K. was due to sales to one customer that did not reoccur in the current year period. The increase in TS segment service revenues of $1.6 million during the period was primarily the result of an increase of $1.8 million in our U.S. division, comprised of a $1.0 million increase in third party service revenues, a $0.9 million increase in third party maintenance revenues, and a $0.6 million increase in managed service contract revenues, partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in internal services. The TS segment increase in service revenue was also partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in the U.K. division.  
 The $6.4 million increase in the Americas revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018 is primarily due to increased revenues by our TS segment of approximately $8.9 million, partially offset by decreased sales by our HPP segment of approximately $2.5 million. The $4.2 million decrease in Europe revenue is primarily due to decreased sales by our TS segment of $3.8 million for the nine month period ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year period. The $1.4 million increase in Asia is primarily the result of increased product sales by our HPP segment of approximately $1.2 million.  
 Gross Margins  
 The gross margin as a percentage of total sales for TS segment revenues remained relatively the same for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. The 1% decrease of gross margin as a percentage of the TS segment services sales is the result of decreased service margins in our U.S. division related to the mix of services provided. The 1% decrease of gross margin as a percentage of the TS segment product sales is the result of decreased product margins in our U.S. division related to the mix of products sold.  
 Engineering and Development Expenses  
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  
 The $305 thousand decrease to other income (expense) for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily driven by a decrease in foreign exchange gain (loss) of $330 thousand, a decrease in other income of $149 thousand, partially offset by an increase of $188 thousand of interest income consisting of investment income and financing income from non-lease sales.   
 The income tax provision for the nine month period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the prior year, changes in pretax income over many jurisdictions, and the impact

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
 The Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2019. Our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team supervised and participated in this evaluation. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a‑15(e) and 15d‑15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and 
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2019, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
