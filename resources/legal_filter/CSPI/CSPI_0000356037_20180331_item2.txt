Forward-Looking Statements
Results of Operations
Overview of the three months ended March 31, 2018 
 Our revenues decreased by approximately $3.3 million, or 13%, to $22.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $25.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in revenue is the result of a decrease of $1.7 million in our TS segment, combined with a $1.6 million decrease in our HPP segment. Our gross margin percentage was unchanged at 22% of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Operating income decreased by approximately $1.3 million from operating income of $622 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to an operating loss of $723 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily as a result of a $765 thousand decrease in gross profit combined with an increase of $580 thousand in operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of higher variable compensation costs and increased costs for sales and engineering hires in our U.S division of the TS segment and increased engineering costs in our HPP segment. Our income tax expense decreased by approximately $339 thousand resulting in an income tax benefit of $128 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to an income tax expense of $211 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease to the income tax expense was primarily due to the decrease in operating income.
Revenues
 Our revenues decreased by approximately $3.3 million to $22.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $25.3 million of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017. TS segment revenues decreased by $1.7 million, and HPP segment revenues decreased by $1.6 million. 
 The decrease in HPP product revenues of $513 thousand is primarily attributed to decreased Multicomputer product shipments. The decrease in HPP services revenues is primarily attributed to a $1.1 million decrease in royalties on high-speed processing boards related to the E2D program shipped for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. 
The decrease in TS segment product revenues of $3.0 million during the period was primarily the result of a decrease in product revenues of $1.4 million in our U.K. division, combined with decreases of $1.2 million and $0.4 million in our German and U.S divisions, respectively. The $1.4 million decrease in the U.K. division product revenues was primarily the result of decreased product shipments to a major customer. The decrease in TS segment product revenues was partially offset by an increase in TS segment service revenues of $1.3 million during the period. The increase in TS segment service revenues for the period ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the prior fiscal year three month period was due primarily to an increase of $1.2 million in our U.S. division. The $1.2 million increase in the U.S. division service revenues was substantially the result of a $900 thousand increase in internal services and additional third party maintenance revenues of $300 thousand.
The $2.3 million decrease in revenue to Europe is primarily the result of decreased sales by our TS segment U.K. division of $1.3 million to a U.S. division multi-national customer, combined with decreased sales by our TS segment German division of $1.0 million. The 0.6 million decrease in revenue to Asia is primarily the result of decreased multicomputer product sales by our HPP segment to a major customer as the result of a large one time order in the three months ended March 31, 2017. 
Gross Margins
 Our gross margin ("GM") decreased by $0.8 million to $4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to a gross margin of $5.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The GM as a percentage of revenue was 22% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, unchanged from the three months ended March 31, 2017.
 The overall TS segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 20% for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 from 16% for the three month period ended March 31, 2017. The overall TS segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increase was primarily due to increased product margins and increased higher margin service revenue in our U.S. division.
Operating Expenses
Engineering and Development Expenses
The engineering and development expenses incurred by our HPP segment were $0.8 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The current period expenses were primarily for Myricom product engineering expenses incurred in connection with the development of the new Myricom ARIA security products. The increased engineering and development expenses for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three month period ended March 31, 2017 is primarily attributed to an increase in engineering headcount related expenses.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
The net change to other income (expenses) of $16 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily driven by the net change of approximately $37 thousand in the foreign exchange gain (loss) on foreign currency holdings in the current period as compared to the prior year period, partially offset by changes in other income of $18 thousand. 
Our revenues decreased by approximately $1.3 million, or 3%, to $44.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $45.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in overall revenue for the six month period ended March 31, 2018 as compared to prior fiscal year six month period was the result of an approximately $1.9 million decrease in our HPP segment revenue, partially offset by an increase of approximately $0.6 million in our TS segment. The HPP segment revenue was primarily impacted by lower royalties recognized of approximately $0.8 million on high-speed processing boards during the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared $2.2 million of royalty revenues for the six month period ended March 31, 2017. Our gross margin percentage increased overall, from 22% of revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2017, to 23% for the six months ended March 31, 2018. Our operating income decreased by approximately $1.2 million to to an operating loss of $0.7 million for the six month period ended March 31, 2018 as compared to operating income of $0.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017, primarily as a result of increased selling and marketing expenses and increased engineering expenses. Our income tax expense increased by approximately $778 thousand to an income tax expense of $974 thousand for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to an income tax expense of $196 thousand for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The increase to the income tax expense was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017.
Revenues
 Our total revenues decreased by $1.3 million to $44.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared $45.2 million of revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2017. 
The decrease in HPP product revenues for the period of $0.4 million was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately $0.8 million in Multicomputer product line shipments, partially due to a large shipment in the prior fiscal year period, partially offset by an increase in Myricom product line shipments of $0.4 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the six months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in HPP services revenues of $1.5 million for the 
period was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately $1.4 million in royalty revenues on high-speed processing boards related to the E2D program during the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the six months ended March 31, 2017. 
The decrease in TS segment product revenues of $2.1 million during the period was primarily the result of a decrease in product revenues of $1.3 million and $1.2 million in our German and U.S. divisions, respectively, partially offset by an increase in product revenues of $0.4 million in our U.K division. The $1.3 million decrease in the German division product revenues was primarily the result of lowers sales volume to a major customer due to customer orders being deferred into the third quarter of 2018. The $1.2 million decrease in the U.S. division product revenues was primarily the result of decreases in product shipments to a major customer. The increase in TS segment service revenues of $2.7 million during the period was primarily the result of an increase of $2.2 million and $0.5 million in our U.S. and German divisions, respectively. The $2.2 million increase in the U.S. division service revenues was primarily due to $1.7 million of increased internal services and increased third party maintenance revenues of $0.6 million.
The $1.3 million decrease in total revenues is primarily attributed to our HPP segment. The $0.4 million decrease in Asia is primarily the result of decreased product sales by our HPP segment to a major customer of approximately $0.7 million, partially offset by increased sales by our TS segment of $0.4 million. The $0.3 million decrease in Americas is primarily due to decreased revenues by our HPP segment of approximately $1.2 million, partially offset by increased sales by our TS segment U.S. division of approximately $0.9 million. The $0.5 million decrease in Europe revenue is primarily due to decreased sales by our German division of our TS segment.
Gross Margins
Engineering and Development Expenses
Engineering and development expenses increased by $0.3 million to $1.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $1.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. The current period expenses were primarily for Myricom product engineering expenses incurred in connection with the development of the new Myricom ARIA security products. The increased engineering and development expenses for the six month period ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the six month period ended March 31, 2017 is primarily attributed to an increase in engineering headcount related expenses.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
The decrease to other income (expenses) for the six months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the six months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily driven by the net change of approximately $0.2 million in the foreign exchange gain (loss) on foreign currency holdings in the current period as compared to the prior year period. 
For the six months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $974 thousand, which was primarily due to $1.1 million recorded in the first quarter for the Tax Act. The Tax Act required the Company to revalue its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new rate in the Company's first quarter of 2018. The Company has recorded a provisional estimate for a one-time tax expense of $490 thousand, for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Tax Act also requires a mandatory deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and profits, at the rate of either 15.5% for cash or 8% for non-liquid assets. The Company has included a provisional estimate in the amount of $649 thousand related to the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. As noted, these expenses have been recorded discretely in the three months ended December 31, 2017. The provisional amount is based on information currently available, including estimated tax earnings and profits from foreign investments. The income tax provision for the current period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year due to the impact of the Tax Act, changes in pretax income over many jurisdictions, and the impact of discrete items. Generally, fluctuations in the effective tax rate are primarily due to changes in our geographic pretax income resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of permanent differences, other special items, and other discrete tax items, which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item.
Our primary source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents, which decreased by $1.9 million to $12.0 million as of March 31, 2018 from $13.9 million as of September 30, 2017. 
Significant sources of cash for the six months ended March 31, 2018 included a decrease in accounts receivable of $4.5 million, an increase in deferred revenues of $3.0 million, and a decrease in inventories of $1.0 million.
Significant uses of cash for the six months ended March 31, 2018 included a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $5.4 million, a decrease in deferred costs of $2.0 million, a net loss of $1.8 million, an increase in other current assets of $1.0 million, and dividends paid of $0.9 million. 
Cash held by our foreign subsidiaries located in Germany and the United Kingdom totaled approximately $3.7 million as of March 31, 2018 as compared to $4.6 million as of September 30, 2017. This cash is included in our total cash and cash equivalents reported above. 
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures
The Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2018. Our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team supervised and participated in this evaluation. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2018, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to the fact that we are not yet able to conclude that the material weakness described below in this Item 4 has been remediated by the changes we made in response to that material weakness. 
During the periods following our initial identification of the material weakness referred to above, management assessed various alternatives to remediate this material weakness and we implemented changes to our system of internal controls, which included the implementation of enhanced internal auditing procedures, whereby revenue transactions are subjected to an additional review process at the corporate level to ensure the correct accounting methodology is applied to all revenue transactions. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, management continued to take actions to improve accounting operations in our European divisions. Although we have implemented such changes to our internal controls over financial reporting as described above, at this time, we cannot conclude that the material weakness has been remediated and we will continue to evaluate personnel changes and upgrade systems and processes throughout fiscal year 2018 as necessary.
