Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
On May 29, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Microsemi which operated under its own set of systems and internal controls. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we transitioned certain of Microsemi's processes to our internal control processes and we expect to transition more of such processes throughout the remainder of fiscal 2019.
