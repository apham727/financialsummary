Fiscal Period
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The first quarter of 2018 spanned 13 weeks, whereas a 14th week was added to the first quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.
First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights
Net sales increased 13% or $9.9 billion during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017, primarily driven by growth in iPhone, Other Products and Services. The year-over-year increase in net sales reflected growth in all of the Company’s geographic reportable segments. The Company began shipping iPhone X in November 2017 and iMac Pro™ in December 2017.
The Company spent $10.1 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.3 billion during the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, the Company issued $7.0 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated term debt.
Sales Data
Product Performance
iPhone net sales increased during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017 due primarily to a different mix of iPhones with higher average selling prices.
iPad net sales increased during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017 due primarily to a different mix of iPads with higher average selling prices.
Mac net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017 due primarily to lower Mac unit sales given the positive impact of the MacBook Pro® launch during the first quarter of 2017 on that quarter’s results.
The year-over-year growth in Services net sales in the first quarter of 2018 was due primarily to increases in licensing and App Store sales.
Segment Operating Performance
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”
Americas
Americas net sales increased during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Other Products.
Europe net sales increased during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services. The strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable year-over-year impact on Europe net sales during the first quarter of 2018.
Greater China
Greater China net sales increased during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.
Japan net sales increased during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone, partially offset by the weakness in the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar.
Rest of Asia Pacific
Rest of Asia Pacific net sales increased during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017 due primarily to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.
Gross margin percentage during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017 was relatively flat.
Research and Development
Selling, General and Administrative
The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017 was driven primarily by higher spending on marketing and advertising, and an increase in infrastructure-related costs.
The Company’s effective tax rate of 25.8% for the first quarter of 2018 differs from the blended rate of 24.5% due primarily to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by the impact of taxes on foreign earnings. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 is slightly lower than the first quarter of 2017 due to the lower U.S. statutory blended tax rate, primarily offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. Although Ireland is still computing the recovery amount, the Company expects the amount to be in line with the European Commission’s announced recovery amount of €13 billion, plus interest of €1 billion. Once the recovery amount is finalized by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it by placing amounts into escrow in 2018, pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Hedging
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. While the Company is currently evaluating the timing and impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, currently the Company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities in excess of $9.6 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company’s lease portfolio as of the adoption date.
Revenue Recognition 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.

The new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company will adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The new revenue standards are not expected to have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
