Products and Services Performance
Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework. As a result, products and services net sales information for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation.
iPad net sales increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of iPad Pro®.
Wearables, Home and Accessories
Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of Apple Watch and AirPods.
Services net sales increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to the App Store, licensing and AppleCare.
Segment Operating Performance
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”
Americas
Greater China
Japan net sales during the second quarter of 2019 were relatively flat compared to the same quarter in 2018, as higher Services and iPad net sales were primarily offset by lower iPhone net sales. Year-over-year Japan net sales decreased during the first six months of 2019 due primarily to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Services and iPad net sales. The value of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on Japan net sales during the second quarter of 2019.
Rest of Asia Pacific
Gross Margin
Products Gross Margin
Services Gross Margin
Services gross margin increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 due primarily to a different services mix. Year-over-year services gross margin percentage increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2019 due primarily to a different services mix and leverage of the Company’s services fixed cost structure from higher services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

Financial Instruments
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of its first quarter of 2020. While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, based on the lease portfolio as of March 30, 2019, the Company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities of approximately $9 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company’s lease portfolio as of the adoption date.
The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.
In connection with the State Aid Decision, as of March 30, 2019, the entire recovery amount of €13.1 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals.
The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.
During the six months ended March 30, 2019, cash generated by operating activities of $37.8 billion was a result of $31.5 billion of net income and non-cash adjustments to net income of $9.2 billion, partially offset by a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $2.9 billion. Cash generated by investing activities of $19.2 billion during the six months ended March 30, 2019 consisted primarily of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $25.7 billion, partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $5.7 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $43.1 billion during the six months ended March 30, 2019 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $32.5 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $7.0 billion and cash used to repay term debt of $2.5 billion.
Capital Assets
Debt
The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of March 30, 2019, the Company had $11.9 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.56% and maturities generally less than nine months.
As of March 30, 2019, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $101.2 billion (collectively the “Notes”). During the first six months of 2019, the Company repaid $2.5 billion of its Notes upon maturity. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes.
Further information regarding the Company’s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 3, “Financial Instruments” and Note 6, “Debt.”
Capital Return Program
On April 30, 2019, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.73 to $0.77 per share, beginning with the dividend to be paid during the third quarter of 2019. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.
Operating Leases
As of March 30, 2019, the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $10.4 billion. The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options.
Manufacturing Purchase Obligations
The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of March 30, 2019, the Company expects to pay $26.2 billion under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, which are primarily noncancelable.
Other Purchase Obligations
As of March 30, 2019, a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the $30.9 billion deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act. The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.
Indemnification
The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.
The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Revenue Recognition
The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSP”). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.
