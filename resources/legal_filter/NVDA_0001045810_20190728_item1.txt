Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



Basis of Presentation



The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position have been included.
Leases 



We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception.
Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.
Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate.
Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives.
Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.
Refer to Note 3 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Fiscal Year



We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January.
Fiscal years 2020 and 2019 are both 52-week years.
The second quarters of fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were both 13-week quarters.
Principles of Consolidation



Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement



The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases under which lease assets and liabilities are recognized on the balance sheet.
We adopted this guidance on January 28, 2019 using the optional transition method by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet.
Refer to Note 3 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
The standard will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted.
We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note 2 - Merger Agreement with Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.



On March 10, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Mellanox Technologies Ltd., or Mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Mellanox for $125 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion as of the date of the Merger Agreement.
The closing of the merger is subject to approval by regulatory agencies.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals, we could be obligated to pay Mellanox a termination fee of $350 million.
We have received regulatory approval in the United States and Mexico and are engaged with regulators in Europe and China.
In June 2019, Mellanox shareholders approved the merger.
Note 3 - New Lease Accounting Standard



Method and Impact of Adoption



On January 28, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard using the optional transition method by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet and not adjusting comparative information for prior periods.
In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allowed us not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases.
The cumulative-effect adjustment upon adoption of the new lease accounting standard resulted in the recognition of $470 million of operating lease assets and $500 million of operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The difference of $30 million represents deferred rent for leases that existed as of the date of adoption, which was an offset to the opening balance of operating lease assets.
Lease Obligations



Our lease obligations consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2020 and 2035.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of January 27, 2019, based on the previous lease accounting standard, are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Operating lease expense for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020 was $28 million and $55 million, respectively.
Operating lease expense for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019 was $20 million and $36 million, respectively.

Note 5 – Net Income Per Share



The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares.
(2)



Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.
Note 6 – Income Taxes



We recognized an income tax expense of $54 million and $48 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020, respectively, and $79 million and $146 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020 was 8.8% and 4.9%, respectively, and 6.7% and 5.9% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, respectively.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal year 2020 as compared to the first half of fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit and stock-based compensation.
As of July 28, 2019, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
Note 7 - Marketable Securities 



Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as “available-for-sale” debt securities.
The following is a summary of cash equivalents and marketable securities as of July 28, 2019 and January 27, 2019:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Note 8 – Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

Note 9 - Amortizable Intangible Assets



The components of our amortizable intangible assets are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The increase in gross carrying amount of intangible assets is due to purchases of licensed technology during the first half of fiscal year 2020.
Amortization expense associated with intangible assets was $6 million and $13 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020, respectively, and $6 million and $17 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, respectively.
Future amortization expense related to the net carrying amount of intangible assets as of July 28, 2019 is estimated to be $12 million for the remainder of fiscal year 2020, $16 million in fiscal year 2021, $9 million in fiscal year 2022, $7 million in fiscal year 2023, and $5 million in fiscal year 2024.

Note 12 - Debt



Long-Term Debt



2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026



In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021, and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the Notes.
Interest on the Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year.
Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium.
However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026.
The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs.
The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.
The carrying value of the Notes and the associated interest rates were as follows:

Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities



The estimated amount of product returns and warranty liabilities was $17 million and $18 million as of July 28, 2019 and January 27, 2019, respectively.
Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability.
Litigation



Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits



On December 21, 2018, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Iron Workers Joint Funds v. Nvidia Corporation, et al.
(Case No.
18-cv-7669), naming as defendants NVIDIA and certain of NVIDIA’s officers.
On December 28, 2018, a substantially similar purported securities class action was commenced in the Northern District of California, captioned Oto v. Nvidia Corporation, et al.
(Case No.
18-cv-07783), naming the same defendants, and seeking substantially similar relief.
On February 19, 2019, a number of shareholders filed motions to consolidate the two cases and to be appointed lead plaintiff and for their respective counsel to be appointed lead counsel.
On March 12, 2019, the two cases were consolidated under case number 4:18-cv-07669-HSG and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation.
On May 2, 2019, the Court appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel.
On June 21, 2019, the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint.
The consolidated complaint asserts that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.
The plaintiffs also allege that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.
On January 18, 2019, a shareholder, purporting to act on the behalf of NVIDIA, filed a derivative lawsuit in the Northern District of California, captioned Han v. Huang, et al.
(Case No.

Litigation Related to Mellanox Merger



On May 3, 2019, an alleged stockholder of Mellanox filed a putative class action lawsuit alleging that the proxy statement filed by Mellanox in connection with the stockholder vote on NVIDIA’s pending acquisition of Mellanox violates Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and asserting claims under those statutes against Mellanox and its board of directors as well as NVIDIA.
The complaint, which is captioned Stein v. Mellanox Technologies, Ltd., et al., Case No.

A number of other alleged Mellanox stockholders have filed substantially similar lawsuits against Mellanox and its directors in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, but to date, NVIDIA has not been named as a defendant in any of these other lawsuits.
Note 14 - Shareholders’ Equity 



Capital Return Program 



Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.
During the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2020, we paid $97 million and $195 million, respectively, in cash dividends to our shareholders.
Through July 28, 2019, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $7.08 billion.
As of July 28, 2019, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.
Preferred Stock



As of July 28, 2019 and January 27, 2019, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.
Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments.
We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying architecture.
Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for artificial intelligence, data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users.
Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.
Under the single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business.
In instances where the operating

expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most.
Reportable segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported.
