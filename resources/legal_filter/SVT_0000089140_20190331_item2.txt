Revenue  



The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $1,444,000 or 13.7% for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018.
The increase in revenue is attributable to an increase in commercial and government shipments at the ATG in addition to an increase in government shipments at the CPG.
This is partially offset by a decrease in commercial shipments at the CPG.
Commercial and government shipments increased approximately $1,278,000 or 15.4% and $202,000 or 25.1% at the ATG for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018.
This is offset by a net decrease in CPG shipments.
CPG government shipments increased approximately $23,000 of 17.6% and commercial shipments decreased approximately $59,000 or (4.5%) for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased approximately $300,000 or (18.4)% for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.
This is primarily driven by an increase in sales promotions, sales support, increased attendance at trade shows and travel expenditures for the CPG for the three month period ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.

Net Income 



Income from operations decreased approximately $233,000 or (70.4)% when comparing the three month period ended March 31, 2019 to the same period in 2018.
