 Item 1A:  
Risk Factors  
On July 10, 2018, the United States Trade Representative announced a proposed 10% tariff on many additional products made in China and imported into the United States. It is uncertain whether this proposed tariff will be implemented and, if implemented, as to the products that will be covered. At this time, we do not expect that this proposed 10% tariff will significantly impact any Teradyne products and thus the proposed tariff should not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  
In January 2018, our Board of Directors cancelled the December 2016 stock repurchase program and authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of common stock. We intend to repurchase $750 million in 2018. During the six months ended July 1, 2018, we repurchased 8.8 million shares of common stock for $360.8 million at an average price of $40.82 per share.

In December 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $500 million share repurchase authorization, which commenced on January 1, 2017. During the six months ended July 2, 2017, we repurchased 3.0 million shares of common stock for $94.3 million at an average price of $31.77 per share.  
We satisfy U.S. federal and state minimum withholding tax obligations due upon the vesting and the conversion of restricted stock units into shares of our common stock, by automatically withholding from the shares being issued, a number of shares with an aggregate fair market value on the date of such vesting and conversion that would satisfy the minimum withholding amount due.
