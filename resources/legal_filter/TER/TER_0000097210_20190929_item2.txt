Overview  
semiconductor test (“Semiconductor Test”) systems;   
industrial automation (“Industrial Automation”) products;   
wireless test (“Wireless Test”) systems.   
On February 26, 2018, we acquired Energid Technologies Corporation (“Energid”) for a total purchase price of approximately $27.6 million. Energid’s technology enables and simplifies the programming of complex robotic motions used in a wide variety of end markets, ranging from heavy industry to healthcare, utilizing both traditional robots and collaborative robots.  
On April 25, 2018, we acquired Mobile Industrial Robots ApS (“MiR”), a Danish limited liability company. MiR is the leading maker of collaborative autonomous mobile robots for industrial applications. The total purchase price was approximately $197.8 million, which included cash paid of approximately $145.2 million and $52.6 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of certain thresholds and targets for revenue and earnings before interest and taxes through 2020. Contingent consideration for 2018 was $30.8 million and was paid in March 2019. The maximum payment for the remaining MiR contingent consideration that could be paid is $81.0 million.

MiR and Energid are included in our Industrial Automation segment.  
On June 3, 2019, we invested $15 million in RealWear, Inc. (“RealWear”). RealWear, a private company, develops and sells advanced wearable technology including industrial, hands-free, head-mounted augmented reality devices that make the workplace safer and more productive. Our investment in RealWear aligns with our strategy of bringing the power of advanced automation to companies of all sizes to improve the productivity of their employees and the quality of their products and services.  
On October 18, 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the equity of AutoGuide, LLC (“AutoGuide”), a maker of high-payload autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), an emerging and fast growing segment of the global forklift market for $58 million of cash and up to $107 million in earn-outs potentially through 2022. AutoGuide is based in Chelmsford, MA. AutoGuide’s AMRs are used for material transport of payloads up to 4,500 kg in manufacturing, warehouse and logistics applications. These products complement MiR’s lower payload products. The acquisition of AutoGuide is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval. AutoGuide will be included in Teradyne’s Industrial Automation segment.  
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, except as noted below. 
“Leases (Topic 842)” (“Topic 842”), which requires a lessee to record a 
right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for operating leases with terms longer than twelve months. We adopted this standard and the related amendments (collectively “ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019 and utilized the modified retrospective approach provided by ASU 
Under ASC 842, a contract is or contains a lease when we have the right to control the use of an identified asset. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations. The commencement date of the lease is the date that the lessor makes an underlying asset available for use. As of September 29, 2019, we do not have material leases that have not yet commenced.  
We determine if the lease is operating or finance at the lease commencement date based upon the terms of the lease and the nature of the asset. The lease term used to calculate the lease liability includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.  
Table of Contents 
For leases commencing after January 1, 2019, the lease liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. As we are typically unable to determine the implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and economic environment at commencement date. We initially measure payments based on an index by using the applicable rate at lease commencement. Variable payments that do not depend on an index are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred. The ROU asset is initially measured as the amount of lease liability, adjusted for any initial lease costs, prepaid lease payments, and reduced by any lease incentives.  
Our contracts often include 
non-lease components such as common area maintenance. We elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and

Revenues  
Revenues attributable to a country are based on location of customer site.   
Gross Profit  
Table of Contents 
Gross profit as a percent of revenue increased by 0.4 points, primarily due to favorable product mix in Semiconductor Test and Storage Test.  
During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded an inventory provision of $3.3 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels, of which $2.1 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $0.7 million was related to Wireless Test, and $0.4 million was related to Industrial Automation.  
During the three months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we scrapped $3.4 million and $1.7 million of inventory, respectively. During the three months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we sold $0.8 million and $1.0 million of previously written-down or 
written-off inventory, respectively. As of September 29, 2019, we had inventory related reserves, which had been written-down or 
written-off totaling $101.2 million. We have no 
pre-determined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory.

During the three months ended September 29, 2019, we recorded a $7.8 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the MiR contingent consideration liability, partially offset by $0.5 million recorded for employee severance charges primarily in Industrial Automation, $0.5 million for acquisition related compensation and expenses, and $0.3 million of fixed assets impairment in Wireless Test.
