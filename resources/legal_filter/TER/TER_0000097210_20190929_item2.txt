10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, except as noted below. 
right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for operating leases with terms longer than twelve months. We adopted this standard and the related amendments (collectively “ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019 and utilized the modified retrospective approach provided by ASU 
Under ASC 842, a contract is or contains a lease when we have the right to control the use of an identified asset. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations. The commencement date of the lease is the date that the lessor makes an underlying asset available for use. As of September 29, 2019, we do not have material leases that have not yet commenced.  
We determine if the lease is operating or finance at the lease commencement date based upon the terms of the lease and the nature of the asset. The lease term used to calculate the lease liability includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.  
non-lease components as a single lease component. For leases with a term of one year or less we elected not to record the lease asset or liability. The lease payments are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We include lease costs within cost of revenues and operating expenses. 
Revenues attributable to a country are based on location of customer site.   
Gross profit as a percent of revenue increased by 0.4 points, primarily due to favorable product mix in Semiconductor Test and Storage Test.  
During the three months ended September 29, 2019, we recorded an inventory provision of $3.0 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels, of which $1.9 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $0.7 million was related to Wireless Test and $0.4 million was related to System Test.  
During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded an inventory provision of $3.3 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels, of which $2.1 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $0.7 million was related to Wireless Test, and $0.4 million was related to Industrial Automation.

written-off totaling $101.2 million. We have no 
The increase of $0.8 million in engineering and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending in Industrial Automation, partially offset by lower spending in Semiconductor Test.  
During the three months ended September 29, 2019, we recorded a $7.8 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the MiR contingent consideration liability, partially offset by $0.5 million recorded for employee severance charges primarily in Industrial Automation, $0.5 million for acquisition related compensation and expenses, and $0.3 million of fixed assets impairment in Wireless Test.  
During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded $1.7 million for employee severance charges, primarily in Semiconductor Test and $0.8 million for acquisition related compensation, partially offset by a $0.8 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability.  
Interest income decreased by $1.0 million due primarily to lower unrealized gains on equity marketable securities in 2019. Other (income) expense, net decreased by $0.7 million due primarily to lower foreign exchange losses.

written-off inventory, respectively. As of September 29, 2019, we had inventory related reserves for inventory, which had been written-down or 
written-off totaling $101.2 million. We have no 
The increase of $29.9 million in selling and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher spending in Industrial Automation from higher sales and marketing spending in Universal Robots and MiR, which was acquired on April 25, 2018.  
The increase of $9.2 million in engineering and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending in Industrial Automation partially offset by lower spending in Semiconductor Test.  
During the nine months ended September 29, 2019, we recorded a $16.5 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the MiR contingent consideration liability, partially offset by $2.1 million recorded for employee severance charges primarily in Semiconductor Test and Industrial Automation, $2.3 million for acquisition related expenses and compensation and $0.3 million of fixed assets impairment in Wireless Test.

Interest expense decreased by $0.9 million due primarily to lower realized losses on sales of marketable securities in 2019. Other (income) expense, net increased by $2.2 million due primarily to higher pension costs and higher foreign exchange losses.  
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 was 9.2% and 13.6%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from the nine months ended September 29, 2019 to the nine months ended September 30, 2018 primarily resulted from the tax rate effect of a projected shift in the geographic distribution of income, which reduces the income subject to taxation in higher tax rate jurisdictions relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions, and an increase in net discrete tax benefit. These reductions were partially offset by a decrease in the net favorable impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
