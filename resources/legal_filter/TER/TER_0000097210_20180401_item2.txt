Overview  
      semiconductor test (Semiconductor Test) systems;  
      industrial automation (Industrial Automation) products; and  
 workers to improve quality, increase manufacturing efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs. The acquisition of Universal Robots provides a growth engine to our business and complements our existing System Test and Wireless Test segments. The total purchase price for Universal Robots was approximately $315 million, which included cash paid of approximately $284 million and $32 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of revenue and earnings targets through 2018. The contingent consideration related to revenue for the period from July 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017 in the amount of $24.6 million was paid in March 2018. The remaining maximum contingent consideration that could be paid in 2019 is $25 million.  
On February 26, 2018, we acquired Energid Technologies Corporation (Energid) for a total preliminary purchase price of approximately $27.6 million. Energids technology enables and simplifies the programming of complex robotic motions used in a wide variety of end markets, ranging from heavy industry to healthcare; utilizing both traditional robots and collaborative robots.  
On April 25, 2018, we acquired Mobile Industrial Robots ApS (MiR), a Danish limited liability company, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $148 million net of cash acquired, and up to an additional approximately $124 million payable upon the achievement of certain revenue and profit performance targets through 2020. MiR is the leading maker of collaborative autonomous mobile robots for industrial applications. MiR and Energid will be included in our Industrial Automation segment.  
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
 Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates  
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  
In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenues, when or as control is transferred to a customer. Our determination of revenue is dependent upon a five step process outlined below.  
Transaction price is allocated to each individual performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of that performance obligation. We use standalone transactions when available to value each performance obligation. If standalone transactions are not available, we will estimate the standalone selling price through market assessments or cost plus a reasonable margin analysis. Any discounts from standalone selling price are spread over each performance obligation.  
In order to determine the appropriate timing for revenue recognition, we first determine if the transaction meets any of three criteria for over time recognition. If the transaction meets the criteria for over time recognition, we recognize revenue as the good or service is delivered. We use input variables such as hours or months utilized or costs incurred to determine the amount of revenue to recognize in a given period. Input variables are used as they best align consumption with benefit to the customer. For transactions which do not meet the criteria for over time recognition, we will recognize revenue at a point in time based on an assessment of the five criteria for transfer of control. We have concluded that revenue should be recognized when shipped or delivered based on contractual terms. Typically acceptance of our products and services is a formality as we deliver similar systems, instruments and robots to standard specifications. In cases where acceptance is not deemed a formality, we will wait for customer acceptance before recognizing revenue.  
Retirement Benefits  
 expected return on assets, amortization of prior service cost, and actuarial gains or losses, are required to be reported separately outside of income or loss from operations. Following the adoption of this guidance, we continue to record the service cost component in the same line item as other employee compensation costs and the non-service components of net benefit costs such as interest cost, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service cost, and actuarial gains or losses are reported within other (income) expense, net. The retrospective adoption of this standard increased the first quarter of 2017 income from operations by $0.4 million due to the removal of the non-service component of pension expense and decreased other (income) expense, net by the same amount with zero impact to net income.  
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  
First Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017  
Revenues  
The increase in Semiconductor Test revenues of $17.8 million, or 5.0%, was driven primarily by increased sales in the flash memory test segment, partially offset by a decrease in image sensor and microcontroller sales. The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $12.5 million, or 34.4%, was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms. The increase in System Test revenues of $3.2 million, or 8.0%, was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of system level testers. The decrease in Wireless Test revenues of $2.8 million, or 11.1%, was primarily due to lower demand for connectivity and cellular test systems.  
 (1) Revenues attributable to a country are based on location of customer site.  
During the three months ended April 1, 2018, we recorded an inventory provision of $3.5 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels. Of the $3.5 million of total excess and obsolete provisions, $2.2 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $0.8 million was related to Wireless Test, $0.3 million was related to System Test, and $0.2 million was related to Industrial Automation.  
During the three months ended April 2, 2017, we recorded an inventory provision of $2.7 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels. Of the $2.7 million of total excess and obsolete provisions, $1.3 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $0.9 million was related to System Test, and $0.5 million was related to Wireless Test.  
During the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, we scrapped $0.3 million and $1.8 million of inventory, respectively. During the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, we sold $2.2 million and $1.1 million of previously written-down or written-off inventory, respectively. As of April 1, 2018, we had inventory related reserves for inventory which had been written-down or written-off totaling $103.4 million. We have no pre-determined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory.  
Selling and Administrative  
The increase of $5.7 million in selling and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher spending in Industrial Automation.  
Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization  
Acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased primarily in the Industrial Automation segment due to intangible assets that became fully amortized in June 2017, partially offset by increased amortization expense due to the Energid acquisition.  
Restructuring and Other  
During the three months ended April 1, 2018, we recorded a $5.0 million credit for the decrease in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability, partially offset by $3.9 million recorded for employee severance charges, primarily in Semiconductor Test, and $0.8 million of acquisition related expenses.  
During the three months ended April 2, 2017, we recorded $2.5 million of restructuring and other charges of which $1.3 million was for a lease impairment of a Wireless Test facility in Sunnyvale, CA, which was terminated in September 2017, $0.6 million was for employee severance charges and $0.6 million for the increase in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability.  
Interest and Other  
Interest income increased by $2.5 million due primarily to higher cash and marketable securities balances during the quarter and higher interest rates in 2018. Interest expense increased by $1.5 million due primarily to realized losses on sales of marketable securities. Other (income) expense, net included net foreign exchange losses and non-service components of net periodic pension costs and net periodic postretirement benefit costs.  
The decrease in income before income taxes in Semiconductor Test was driven primarily by lower gross margin due to product mix. The increase in income before income taxes in System Test was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of system level testers. The increase in income before income taxes in Industrial Automation was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms. The decrease in income before income taxes in Wireless Test was primarily due to lower demand for connectivity and cellular test systems.  
The effective tax rate for the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017 was 9.2% and 7.4%, respectively.  
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances decreased by $316.1 million in the three months ended April 1, 2018 to $1,588 million.  
Operating activities during the three months ended April 1, 2018 used cash of $81.9 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $212.6 million. This was due to a $162.4 million increase in operating assets and a $50.2 million decrease in operating liabilities.  
The decrease in operating liabilities was due to a $56.3 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to first quarter payments related to variable compensation, a $12.1 million decrease in income taxes, a $7.5 million decrease in other accrued liabilities, and $1.0 million of retirement plan contributions, partially offset by a $17.1 million increase in accounts payable and a $9.6 million increase in deferred revenue and customer advance payments.  
Investing activities during the three months ended April 1, 2018 provided cash of $462.9 million, due to $800.7 million and $212.7 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, respectively, partially offset by $490.3 million used for purchases of marketable securities, $34.8 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment and $25.4 million used for the acquisition of Energid.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in this ASU supersedes the lease recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 840, Leases. The new standard establishes a right- of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statements of operations. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our financial position and results of operations.  
 Item 2: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
