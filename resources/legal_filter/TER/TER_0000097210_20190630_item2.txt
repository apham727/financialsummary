right-of-use  (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for operating leases with terms longer than twelve months. We adopted this standard and the related amendments (collectively “ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019 and utilized the modified retrospective approach provided by ASU 
Under ASC 842, a contract is or contains a lease when we have the right to control the use of an identified asset. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations. The commencement date of the lease is the date that the lessor makes an underlying asset available for use. As of June 30, 2019, we do not have material leases that have not yet commenced.   
We determine if the lease is operating or finance at the lease commencement date based upon the terms of the lease and the nature of the asset. The lease term used to calculate the lease liability includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.  
non-lease components as a single lease component. For leases with a term of one year or less we elected not to record the lease asset or liability. The lease payments are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We include lease costs within cost of revenues and operating expenses. 
The increase in Semiconductor Test revenues of $14.8 million, or 4.1%, was driven primarily by an increase in semiconductor test sales for 5G infrastructure and higher service revenues, partially offset by lower microcontroller, power linear and mobile image sensor test sales.  
Revenues attributable to a country are based on location of customer site.   
on-order inventory positions. Forecasted revenue information is obtained from sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters for our Semiconductor Test, System Test and Industrial Automation segments and the next four quarters for our Wireless Test segment, is written-down to estimated net realizable value.  
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded an inventory provision of $3.4 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels, of which $2.3 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $0.8 million was related to Wireless Test and $0.3 million was related to System Test.

During the three months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded an $11.7 million credit for the decrease in the fair value of the MiR contingent consideration liability, partially offset by $0.8 million recorded for severance charges primarily in Semiconductor Test and $0.5 million of acquisition related compensation and expenses.  
During the three months ended July 1, 2018, we recorded $2.5 million of acquisition related expenses, and $2.4 million for employee severance charges, primarily in Semiconductor Test, partially offset by a $3.5 million credit for the decrease in the fair value of Universal Robots contingent consideration.  
Other (income) expense, net increased by $2.2 million due primarily to higher foreign exchange losses and higher pension costs.  
The increase in income before income taxes in System Test was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5” hard disk drive testers. The increase in income before income taxes in Wireless Test was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave and cellular test products. The decrease in income before income taxes in Industrial Automation was primarily due to increased intangible assets amortization expense from the acquisition of MiR on April 25 2018.   
The decrease in Semiconductor Test revenues of $17.6 million, or 2.4%, was driven primarily by a decrease in memory test sales, partially offset by higher sales related to 5G infrastructure, higher image sensor test sales and higher service revenues. The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $30.0 million, or 27.1%, was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms and the acquisition of MiR, which was acquired on April 25, 2018. The increase in System Test revenues of $18.9 million, or 16.8%, was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5” hard disk drive testers and higher sales in Production Board Test due to 5G. The increase in Wireless Test revenues of $12.6 million, or 21.8%, was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave and cellular test products driven by new wireless standards and 5G partially offset by lower sales in connectivity test products.   
Revenues attributable to a country are based on location of customer site.   
Gross profit as a percent of revenue increased by 0.9 points, primarily due to favorable product mix in Semiconductor Test and System Test.

Interest income increased by $2.1 million due primarily to unrealized gains on equity marketable securities in 2019. Interest expense decreased by $1.0 million due primarily to lower realized losses on sales of marketable securities in 2019. Other (income) expense, net increased by $2.9 million due primarily to higher pension costs and higher foreign exchange losses.  
The decrease in income before income taxes in Semiconductor Test was driven primarily by a decrease in memory test sales, partially offset by higher sales related to 5G infrastructure, higher image sensor test sales and higher service revenues. The increase in income before income taxes in System Test was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5” hard disk drive testers and higher sales in Production Board Test for 5G.
