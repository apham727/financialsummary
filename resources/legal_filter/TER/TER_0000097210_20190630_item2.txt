semiconductor test (“Semiconductor Test”) systems;   
industrial automation (“Industrial Automation”) products;   
On February 26, 2018, we acquired Energid Technologies Corporation (“Energid”) for a total purchase price of approximately $27.6 million. Energid’s technology enables and simplifies the programming of complex robotic motions used in a wide variety of end markets, ranging from heavy industry to healthcare, utilizing both traditional robots and collaborative robots.  
On April 25, 2018, we acquired Mobile Industrial Robots ApS (“MiR”), a Danish limited liability company. MiR is the leading maker of collaborative autonomous mobile robots for industrial applications. The total purchase price was approximately $197.8 million, which included cash paid of approximately $145.2 million and $52.6 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of certain thresholds and targets for revenue and earnings before interest and taxes through 2020. Contingent consideration for 2018 was $30.8 million and was paid in March 2019. The maximum payment for the remaining MiR contingent consideration that could be paid is $84.1 million.  
MiR and Energid are included in our Industrial Automation segment.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, except as noted below. 
“Leases (Topic 842)” (“Topic 842”), which requires a lessee to record a 
right-of-use  (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for operating leases with terms longer than twelve months. We adopted this standard and the related amendments (collectively “ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019 and utilized the modified retrospective approach provided by ASU 
Under ASC 842, a contract is or contains a lease when we have the right to control the use of an identified asset. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations. The commencement date of the lease is the date that the lessor makes an underlying asset available for use. As of June 30, 2019, we do not have material leases that have not yet commenced.   
Table of Contents 
We determine if the lease is operating or finance at the lease commencement date based upon the terms of the lease and the nature of the asset. The lease term used to calculate the lease liability includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.  
For leases commencing after January 1, 2019, the lease liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. As we are typically unable to determine the implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and economic environment at commencement date. We initially measure payments based on an index by using the applicable rate at lease commencement. Variable payments that do not depend on an index are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred. The ROU asset is initially measured as the amount of lease liability, adjusted for any initial lease costs, prepaid lease payments, and reduced by any lease incentives.  
Our contracts often include 
non-lease components such as common area maintenance. We elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and

Revenues  
Table of Contents 
Revenues attributable to a country are based on location of customer site.   
Gross Profit  
Table of Contents 
During the three months ended July 1, 2018, we recorded an inventory provision of $2.7 million included in cost of revenues primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels, of which $1.6 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $0.6 million was related to Wireless Test, $0.3 million was related to System Test, and $0.2 million was related to Industrial Automation.  
During the three months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, we scrapped $2.6 million and $1.1 million of inventory, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, we sold $0.4 million and $1.9 million of previously written-down or 
written-off inventory, respectively. As of June 30, 2019, we had inventory related reserves for inventory, which had been written-down or 
written-off totaling $102.6 million. We have no 
pre-determined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory. 
Selling and Administrative  
The increase of $9.4 million in selling and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher spending in Industrial Automation from higher sales and marketing spending in Universal Robots and MiR. MiR was acquired on April 25, 2018.  
Engineering and Development  
The increase of $6.1 million in engineering and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending in Industrial Automation and Wireless Test.  
Acquired Intangible Assets Amortization  
Table of Contents 
Acquired intangible assets amortization expense increased primarily due to Industrial Automation acquisitions of MiR and Energid in 2018 and the Semiconductor Test acquisition of Lemsys in 2019.  
Restructuring and Other  
During the three months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded an $11.7 million credit for the decrease in the fair value of the MiR contingent consideration liability, partially offset by $0.8 million recorded for severance charges primarily in Semiconductor Test and $0.5 million of acquisition related compensation and expenses.  
The increase in income before income taxes in System Test was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5” hard disk drive testers. The increase in income before income taxes in Wireless Test was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave and cellular test products. The decrease in income before income taxes in Industrial Automation was primarily due to increased intangible assets amortization expense from the acquisition of MiR on April 25 2018.

Six Months 2019 Compared to Six Months 2018  
Revenues  
The decrease in Semiconductor Test revenues of $17.6 million, or 2.4%, was driven primarily by a decrease in memory test sales, partially offset by higher sales related to 5G infrastructure, higher image sensor test sales and higher service revenues. The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $30.0 million, or 27.1%, was due to higher demand for collaborative robotic arms and the acquisition of MiR, which was acquired on April 25, 2018. The increase in System Test revenues of $18.9 million, or 16.8%, was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5” hard disk drive testers and higher sales in Production Board Test due to 5G. The increase in Wireless Test revenues of $12.6 million, or 21.8%, was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave and cellular test products driven by new wireless standards and 5G partially offset by lower sales in connectivity test products.

Restructuring and Other  
Table of Contents 
During the six months ended July 1, 2018, we recorded $6.3 million for severance charges, primarily in Semiconductor Test and Industrial Automation, and $3.3 million for acquisition related expenses, partially offset by an $8.5 million credit for the decrease in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability.  
Interest income increased by $2.1 million due primarily to unrealized gains on equity marketable securities in 2019. Interest expense decreased by $1.0 million due primarily to lower realized losses on sales of marketable securities in 2019. Other (income) expense, net increased by $2.9 million due primarily to higher pension costs and higher foreign exchange losses.  
The decrease in income before income taxes in Semiconductor Test was driven primarily by a decrease in memory test sales, partially offset by higher sales related to 5G infrastructure, higher image sensor test sales and higher service revenues. The increase in income before income taxes in System Test was primarily due to higher sales in Storage Test of 3.5” hard disk drive testers and higher sales in Production Board Test for 5G. The increase in income before income taxes in Wireless Test was primarily due to higher demand for millimeter wave and cellular test products driven by new wireless standards and 5G, partially offset by lower connectivity test products sales. The decrease in income before income taxes in Industrial Automation was primarily due to increased intangible assets amortization expense from the acquisitions of MiR and Energid in 2018.  
The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018 was 8.3% and 12.9%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from the six months ended July 1, 2018 to the six months
