The accompanying financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Teradynes Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 1, 2018, for the year ended December 31, 2017.  
Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates  
Revenue from Contracts with Customers  
Teradyne adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. The reported results for 2018 reflect the application of ASC 606 while the reported results for 2017 were prepared under the guidance of ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605), which is also referred to herein as Legacy GAAP or the previous guidance. Teradyne recorded a net increase  
Table of Contents 
In accordance with ASC 606, Teradyne recognizes revenues, when or as control is transferred to a customer. Teradynes determination of revenue is dependent upon a five step process outlined below.  
Teradyne considers the amount stated on the face of the purchase order to be the transaction price. Teradyne does not have material variable consideration, which could impact the stated purchase price agreed to by Teradyne and the customer.  
Transaction price is allocated to each individual performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of that performance obligation. Teradyne uses standalone transactions when available to value each performance obligation. If standalone transactions are not available, Teradyne will estimate the standalone selling price through market assessments or cost plus a reasonable margin analysis. Any discounts from standalone selling price are spread proportionally to each performance obligation.  
In order to determine the appropriate timing for revenue recognition, Teradyne first determines if the transaction meets any of three criteria for over time recognition. If the transaction meets the criteria for over time recognition, Teradyne recognizes revenue as the good or service is delivered. Teradyne uses input variables such as hours or months utilized or costs incurred to determine the amount of revenue to recognize in a given period. Input variables are used as they best align consumption with benefit to the customer. For transactions that do not meet the criteria for over time recognition, Teradyne will recognize revenue at a point in time based on an assessment of the five criteria for transfer of control. Teradyne has concluded that revenue should be recognized when shipped or delivered based on contractual terms. Typically acceptance of Teradynes products and services is a formality as Teradyne delivers similar systems, instruments and robots to standard specifications. In cases where acceptance is not deemed a formality, Teradyne will defer revenue recognition until customer acceptance.

Performance Obligations  
Hardware  
Table of Contents 
Extended Warranty  
Customers have the option to purchase an extended warranty, which extends the warranty period for systems and robots beyond the one-year standard warranty. The extended warranty is purchased in the same transaction as the system or robot purchase and is classified as a separate performance obligation, which meets the criteria for over time recognition. The relative standalone selling price of the extended warranty is recognized ratably over the course of the extended warranty based on months completed.  
Training and Applications Support  
Teradyne sells training and applications support to customers either in standalone transactions or included with system purchases. The training and support allow the customer to use Teradynes systems efficiently and effectively. Training and applications support included in system orders are valued based on their standalone selling price and all training and applications support is recognized over time as the customer receives and consumes the benefit associated with each. Both are recognized using an input method of hours consumed as this best depicts the transfer of services to the customer.  
Post-Contract Customer Support (PCS)  
Teradyne does not allow customer returns or provide refunds to customers for any products or services.  
The amount of revenue recognized during the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 that was included within the deferred revenue and customer advances balance at January 1, 2018 was $24.7 million and $46.5 million, respectively, and primarily relates to extended warranties, training, application support, and PCS. Each of these represents a distinct performance obligation. Customers typically pay for these services net 30 to 60 days from the date that transfer of control of the associated system or product occurs.

Remaining Performance Obligations  
Teradyne does not have material remaining performance obligations from contracts with an original expected duration of greater than one year.  
Significant Judgments  
Impacts  
The following tables summarize the impact of ASC 606 to Teradynes consolidated financial statements. Differences are the result of timing differences between the recognition of revenue under ASC 606 and ASC 605 primarily with respect to software transactions deferred due to lack of vendor specific objective evidence of price under ASC 605 and Teradynes assessment of acceptance under ASC 606. Under Legacy GAAP, Teradyne did not recognize revenue prior to acceptance if payment, title, or risk of loss was tied to acceptance. Under ASC 606, Teradyne recognizes revenue prior to receipt of acceptance if acceptance is deemed a formality.

Contingencies and Litigation  
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in this ASU supersedes the lease recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 840, Leases. The new standard establishes a right- of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statements of operations. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Teradyne is still assessing the potential changes from this ASU, but expects it to have a material impact on its financial position and immaterial impact on its results of operations.  
Mobile Industrial Robots  
On April 25, 2018, Teradyne acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of Mobile Industrial Robots ApS (MiR), a Danish limited liability company located in Odense, Denmark. MiR is the leading maker of collaborative autonomous mobile robots for industrial applications. MiR is part of Teradynes Industrial Automation segment.  
The total preliminary purchase price of $196.6 million consisted of $145.2 million of cash paid and $51.4 million of contingent consideration, measured at fair value. The contingent consideration is payable in  
Table of Contents 
 Euros upon the achievement of certain thresholds and targets for revenue and earnings before interest and taxes for periods from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018; January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019; and January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020. At July 1, 2018, the maximum amount of contingent consideration that could be paid is $117 million.  
For the period from April 25, 2018 to July 1, 2018, MiR contributed $4.5 million of revenues and had a $(1.5) million loss from operations before income taxes.  
Table of Contents 
Pro forma results for the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 were adjusted to exclude $2.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of acquisition related costs, and $0.4 million of non-recurring expense related to fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventory.  
On February 26, 2018, Teradyne acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Energid Technologies Corporation (Energid) for a total purchase price of approximately $27.6 million. Energids technology enables and simplifies the programming of complex robotic motions used in a wide variety of end markets, ranging from heavy industry to healthcare, utilizing both traditional robots and collaborative robots. The Energid acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, Energids results have been included in Teradynes Industrial Automation segment from the date of acquisition. As of the acquisition date, Teradynes purchase price allocation was goodwill of $14.4 million, acquired intangible assets of $12.3 million with an average estimated useful life of 7.7 years, and $1.0 million of net tangible assets. The acquisition was not material to Teradynes condensed consolidated financial statements.  
Inventory reserves at July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $103.2 million and $102.9 million, respectively.  
Table of Contents 
Cash Equivalents  
Teradyne considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.  
Marketable Securities  
The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost;  
The financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and  
The intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.  
Teradynes available-for-sale debt securities are classified as Level 2, and equity securities are classified as Level 1. Acquisition-related contingent consideration is classified as Level 3. Teradyne determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Assumptions utilized in the model include forecasted revenues, revenue volatility, earnings before interest and taxes, and discount rate. The vast majority of Level 2 securities are fixed income securities priced by third party pricing vendors. These pricing vendors utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available, use other observable inputs like market transactions involving identical or comparable securities.  
Realized gains recorded in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 were $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Realized losses recorded in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 were $0.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Realized gains recorded in the three and six months ended July 2, 2017 were  
Table of Contents 
 $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Realized losses recorded in the three and six months ended July 2, 2017 were $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Realized gains are included in interest income and realized losses are included in interest expense.  
During the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017, there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 financial instruments.  
The following table sets forth by fair value hierarchy Teradynes financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

In the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, the fair value of contingent consideration for the earn-out in connection with the acquisition of Universal Robots was decreased by $3.5 million and $8.5 million, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in forecasted revenue. In the three and six months ended July 2, 2017, the fair value of contingent consideration for the earn-out in connection with the acquisition of Universal Robots was increased by $1.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate.  
Table of Contents 
As of July 1, 2018, the significant unobservable inputs used in the Monte Carlo simulation to fair value the Universal Robots contingent consideration include forecasted revenue, revenue volatility and discount rate. Increases or decreases in the inputs would result in a higher or lower fair value measurement. The maximum payment for the remaining Universal Robots revenue earn-out is $25.0 million.  
The fair values of accounts receivable, net and accounts payable approximate the carrying value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

As of July 1, 2018, the fair market value of investments in available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses totaled $691.6 million. Of this value, $32.7 million had unrealized losses of $1.6 million for greater than one year and $658.9 million had unrealized losses of $1.7 million for less than one year.  
As of December 31, 2017, the fair market value of investments with unrealized losses totaled $1,350.9 million. Of this value, $141.0 million had unrealized losses of $1.2 million for greater than one year and $1,209.9 million had unrealized losses of $2.2 million for less than one year.  
Contractual maturities of investments in available-for-sale securities held at July 1, 2018 exclude $2.8 million of debt mutual funds as they do not have a contractual maturity date.  
The notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts at July 1, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $93.4 million and $116.8 million, respectively.

The following table summarizes the effect of derivative instruments recognized in the statement of operations for the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017.  
For the three and six months ended July 1, 2018, net gains from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were $1.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively.  
For the three and six months ended July 2, 2017, net losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were $2.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively.

The convertible note hedge is considered indexed to Teradynes stock as the terms of the Note Hedge Transactions do not contain an exercise contingency and the settlement amount equals the difference between the fair value of a fixed number of Teradynes shares and a fixed strike price. Because the only variable that can affect the settlement amount is Teradynes stock price, which is an input to the fair value of a fixed-for-fixed option contract, the convertible note hedge is considered indexed to Teradynes stock.  
Teradynes effective annual interest rate on the Notes will be approximately 5.0%. The Notes are classified as long-term debt in the balance sheet based on their December 15, 2023 maturity date. Debt issuance costs of approximately $7.2 million are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the seven year term of the Notes. As of July 1, 2018, unamortized debt issuance costs were approximately $5.8 million.  
Table of Contents 
As of July 1, 2018, the remaining unamortized discount was $87.1 million, which will be amortized over 5.5 years using the effective interest rate method. The carrying amount of the equity component was $100.8 million. As of July 1, 2018, the if-converted value of the Notes was $550.7 million.  
On April 27, 2015, Teradyne entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year, senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $350 million (the Credit Facility). The Credit Agreement further provides that, subject to customary conditions, Teradyne may seek to obtain from existing or new lenders incremental commitments under the Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $150 million.  
The interest rates applicable to loans under the Credit Facility are, at Teradynes option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 1.00% per annum or LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.00% per annum, based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of Teradyne and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In addition, Teradyne will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the commitments under the Credit Facility ranging from 0.125% to 0.350% per annum, based on the then applicable Consolidated Leverage Ratio.  
Teradyne is not required to repay any loans under the Credit Facility prior to maturity, subject to certain customary exceptions. Teradyne is permitted to prepay all or any portion of the loans under the Credit Facility prior to maturity without premium or penalty, other than customary LIBOR breakage costs.

Time-based restricted stock unit awards granted to employees vest in equal annual installments over four years. Restricted stock unit awards granted to non-employee directors vest after a one year period, with 100% of the award vesting on the earlier of (a) the first anniversary of the grant date or the (b) the date of the following years Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Teradyne expenses the cost of the restricted stock unit awards subject to time-based vesting, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant, ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse.  
Commencing in January 2014, Teradyne granted performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) to its executive officers with a performance metric based on relative total shareholder return (TSR). For TSR grants issued in 2018 and 2017, Teradynes three-year TSR performance is measured against the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Composite Index. The final number of TSR PRSUs that vest will vary based upon the level of performance achieved from 200% to 0% of the target shares capped at four times the grant date value. The TSR PRSUs will vest upon the three-year anniversary of the grant date. The TSR PRSUs are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The number of units expected to be earned, based upon the achievement of the TSR market condition, is factored into the grant date Monte Carlo valuation. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the three-year service period or the period from the grant date to the date described in the retirement provisions below. Compensation expense for employees meeting the retirement provisions prior to the grant date will be recognized in full on the date of the grant. Compensation expense is recognized regardless of the eventual number of units that are earned based upon the market condition, provided the executive officer remains an employee at the end of the three-year period. Compensation expense is reversed if at any time during the three-year service period the executive officer is no longer an employee, subject to the retirement and termination eligibility provisions noted below.  
In January 2018 and 2017, Teradyne granted PRSUs to its executive officers with a performance metric based on three-year cumulative non-GAAP profit before interest and tax (PBIT) as a percent of Teradynes revenue. Non-GAAP PBIT is a financial measure equal to GAAP income from operations less restructuring and other, net; amortization of acquired intangible assets; acquisition and divestiture related charges or credits; pension actuarial gains and losses; non-cash convertible debt interest expense; and other non-recurring gains and charges. The final number of PBIT PRSUs that vest will vary based upon the level of performance achieved from 200% to 0% of the target shares. The PBIT PRSUs will vest upon the three-year anniversary of the grant date. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the three year service period or the period from the grant date to the date described in the retirement provisions below. Compensation expense

 for employees meeting the retirement provisions prior to the grant date will be recognized in full on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized based on the number of units that are earned based upon the three-year Teradyne PBIT as a percent of Teradynes revenue, provided the executive officer remains an employee at the end of the three-year period subject to the retirement and termination eligibility provisions noted below.  
Beginning with PRSUs granted in January 2014, if the recipients employment ends prior to the determination of the performance percentage due to (1) permanent disability or death or (2) retirement or termination other than for cause, after attaining both at least age sixty and at least ten years of service, then all or a portion of the recipients PRSUs (based on the actual performance percentage achieved on the determination date) will vest on the date the performance percentage is determined. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, no PRSUs will vest if the executive officer is no longer an employee at the end of the three-year period.  
Expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of Teradynes stock and the NYSE Composite Index for the 2018 and 2017 grant over the most recent three-year period. The risk-free interest rate was determined using the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Dividend yield was based upon an estimated annual dividend amount of $0.36 per share for 2018 grants and $0.28 per share for 2017 grants, divided by Teradynes stock price on the grant date of $47.70 for the 2018 grant and $28.56 for the 2017 grant.  
During the six months ended July 1, 2018, Teradyne granted 0.6 million of service-based restricted stock unit awards to employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of $46.38, 0.1 million of service-based restricted stock unit awards to non-employee directors at a weighted average grant date fair value of $35.81, and 0.1 million of service-based stock options to executive officers at a weighted average grant date fair value of $12.17.  
During the six months ended July 2, 2017, Teradyne granted 0.8 million of service-based restricted stock unit awards to employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of $27.98, 0.1 million of service-based restricted stock unit awards to non-employee directors at a weighted average grant date fair value of $35.21, and 0.1 million of service-based stock options to executive officers at a weighted average grant date fair value of $7.13.  
Restricted stock unit awards granted to employees vest in equal annual installments over four years. Stock options to purchase Teradynes common stock at 100% of the fair market value on the grant date vest in equal annual installments over four years from the grant date and have a maximum term of seven years.

Teradyne performs its annual goodwill impairment test as required under the provisions of ASC 350-10, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other on December 31 of each fiscal year unless interim indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill is considered impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.

In 2018, $0.3 million of amortizable intangible assets became fully amortized and have been eliminated from the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization.  
Aggregate intangible asset amortization expense was $9.8 million and $17.5 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 and $8.2 million and $16.1 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended July 2, 2017.  
Incremental shares from assumed conversion of the convertible notes was calculated using the difference between the average Teradyne stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80, multiplied by 14.5 million shares. The result of this calculation, representing the total intrinsic value of the convertible debt, was divided by the average Teradyne stock price for the period.

The computation of diluted net income per common share for the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 excludes the effect of the potential vesting of 0.6 million and 0.5 million shares of restricted stock units because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.  
During the six months ended July 1, 2018, Teradyne recorded $6.3 million for employee severance charges, primarily in Semiconductor Test and Industrial Automation, $3.3 million for acquisition related expenses, partially offset by an $8.5 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability.  
During the three months ended July 2, 2017, Teradyne recorded $1.5 million for the increase in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability and $0.8 million for employee severance charges.  
During the six months ended July 2, 2017, Teradyne recorded $2.1 million for the increase in the fair value of the Universal Robots contingent consideration liability, $1.4 million for employee severance charges, primarily in Corporate and Industrial Automation, and a $1.3 million charge for a lease impairment of a Wireless Test facility in Sunnyvale, CA, which was terminated in September 2017.  
Defined Benefit Pension Plans  
Table of Contents 
In the six months ended July 1, 2018, Teradyne contributed $1.3 million to the U.S. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and $0.4 million to certain qualified pension plans for non-U.S. subsidiaries.  
In addition to receiving pension benefits, Teradyne employees in the United States who meet early retirement eligibility requirements as of their termination dates may participate in Teradynes Welfare Plan, which includes medical and dental benefits up to age 65. Death benefits provide a fixed sum to retirees survivors and are available to all retirees. Substantially all of Teradynes current U.S. employees could become eligible for these benefits, and the existing benefit obligation relates primarily to those employees.

The effective tax rate for the three months ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017 was 15.8% and 15.4%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the six months ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017 was 12.9%.  
Discrete tax benefits recorded in the three and six months ended July 1, 2018 amounted to $0.7 million and $6.7 million respectively. The $0.7 million of discrete tax benefit recorded in the three months ended July 1, 2018 consisted primarily of non-taxable foreign exchange gains. The $6.7 million of discrete benefits recorded in the six months ended July 2, 2018 consisted of $9.1 million of discrete tax benefit net of $2.4 million of discrete tax expense. The $9.1 million of discrete tax benefit was composed of $7.6 million from stock based compensation, $1.1 million of non-taxable foreign exchange gains and $0.4 million of other discrete tax benefit. The $2.4 million of discrete tax expense was composed of $1.7 million from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of reductions in tax rates and $0.7 million of other discrete tax expenses.  
Discrete tax items recorded in the three and six months ended July 2, 2017 amounted to expense of $0.5 million and benefit of $6.5 million, respectively. The $0.5 million of discrete tax expense recorded in the three months ended July 2, 2017 was primarily composed of $1.0 million of expense related to actuarial gains, $0.7 million of expense from non-taxable foreign exchange loss and $1.0 million of benefit from stock based compensation, and $0.2 million of other discrete tax benefit. The $6.5 million of discrete tax benefit recorded in the six months ended July 2, 2017 was primarily composed of $6.5 million of benefit from stock-based
