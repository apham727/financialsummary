Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
Revenue Recognition – Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the products, which is when legal transfer of title occurs and control of the product is transferred to the customer. Reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns. Sales returns for both the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $1,000 and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $4,000 and $3,000, respectively. The allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 aggregated $40,000 and $38,000, respectively. 
Overview 
Second quarter of 2019 versus 2018. 
Net sales in the second quarter of 2019 totaled $1,772,000 versus $2,150,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $378,000 or 17.6% over the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of ODM project sales volume. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2019 totaled $616,000 versus $550,000 in the comparable period for 2018. The $66,000 increase was primarily driven by an increase in salaries for severance pay incurred during the second quarter of 2019. 
Other income, net of other expense, in the second quarter of 2019 was $31,000 versus $29,000 in the comparable period for 2018. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 
Income tax provision was $1,000 for both the second quarter of 2019 and 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
Net income was $256,000 for the second quarter of 2019 versus $399,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $143,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above. 
Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 versus Six Months Ended June 30, 2018. 
Net sales in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $3,156,000 versus $3,805,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $649,000 or 17% over the same period last year. The decrease was driven by a decrease of ODM project sales volume. 
Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $1,518,000 versus $1,633,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was approximately 48.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 42.9% for 2018, respectively. The approximately 5% gross profit increase was driven by shipments of new higher gross margin ODM projects. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2019 totaled $1,146,000 versus $1,110,000 in the comparable period for 2018, an increase of $36,000 or 3.2% over the same period last year. The $36,000 increase was primarily driven by an increase of $66,000 in salaries primarily for severance pay incurred during the second quarter of 2019, offset by a decrease of $23,000 in professional fees paid for engineering design services. 
Other income, net of other expenses, in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $56,000 versus $77,000 in the comparable period for 2018. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess office space at our headquarters in Valencia, CA. 
Income tax provision was $2,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 versus $3,000 in 2018, as we do not expect significant taxable income for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
Net income was $440,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 versus $458,000 in the comparable period for 2018, a decrease of $18,000 resulting from the reasons discussed above. 
We historically have satisfied our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term commercial loans, subordinated related party promissory notes and issuance of equity securities. 
Cash flows used for operating activities were $3,000 as opposed to cash flows provided by operating activities of $785,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease of $788,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from inventory and accounts payable compared to the prior period. 
Cash flows used for investing activities were $191,000 and $0 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was primarily due to our $186,000 investment in convertible securities (see Note 3). 
Cash flows used for financing activities were $217,000 and $760,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease of $543,000 compared with the prior period was primarily due to $500,000 from payments on notes payable in the prior year and a $65,000 increase in dividend payments in the current year. The increase to our cash dividends was based upon our November 2, 2018 announcement that our quarterly cash dividends increased by 20% from $0.025 per share to $0.03 per share. 
We believe that funds generated from operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, related party short-term loans, are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities. Otherwise, we may need to liquidate assets to generate the necessary working capital. 
Inventory is included and classified as a current asset. As of June 30, 2019, inventory represented approximately 45% of current assets and 32% of total assets. However, it is likely to take over one year for the inventory to turn and therefore is likely not saleable within a one-year time frame. Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash. 
As of June 30, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
