Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
Overview 
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our March 31, 2018, condensed consolidated financial statements representing approximately 50% of current assets and 34% of total assets. However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash. We cannot assure you that demand in the discrete semiconductor market will increase and that market conditions will improve. Therefore, it is possible that further declines in our carrying values of inventory may result.

Results of Operations 
Net sales in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $1,655,000 versus $2,167,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $512,000 or 23.6% over the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due material shortages, longer production lead times and lower valued per unit products shipped. 
Gross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $654,000 versus $873,000 in the comparable period for 2018, and gross margin percentage of net sales was 39.2% in the first quarter of 2018 versus 40.3% in the comparable period for 2017. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $560,000 versus $540,000 in the comparable period for 2017. The increase was primarily due to professional fees incurred for engineering services for our products. 
Other income, net of other expense, in the first quarter of 2018 was $48,000 versus $29,000 in the comparable period for 2017. Other income was primarily derived from the rental income of excess space at our headquarters’ facility in Valencia, CA. 
Net income was $59,000 for the first quarter of 2018 versus $299,000 in the comparable period for 2017, a decrease of $240,000 resulting from the decrease in net sales. 
We have financed our operations with funds generated from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $493,000 as opposed to $366,000 used for in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of $859,000 in cash flows provided by operations compared with the prior period resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily from inventory, accounts payables and accounts receivables compared to the prior period. 
Cash flows used in investing activities were $3,000 and $23,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Cash flows used in financing activities were $139,000 and $138,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Inventory is included in current assets; however, it will take over one year for the inventory to turn. Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash. 
We believe that funds generated from, or used in operations, in addition to existing cash balances are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of short-term commercial loans, asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities. 
As of May 15, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
