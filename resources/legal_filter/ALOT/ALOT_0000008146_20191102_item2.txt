Indebtedness  
In fiscal 2018, the Company and the Companys wholly owned Danish subsidiaries, ANI ApS and TrojanLabel ApS, entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (the Lender), which, as amended through November 2, 2019 (the Credit Agreement), provides for a secured credit facility consisting of a term loan to ANI ApS in the principal amount of $9.2 million and a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million. The Credit Agreement also provides for a $10.0 million revolving credit facility for the Company.  
Both term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.  
In connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement, ANI ApS entered into a hedging agreement to manage the variable interest rate risk and currency risk associated with its payments in respect to the term loan. Under this combined arrangement, payments of principal and interest with respect to approximately $8.9 million of the principal of the term loan will be made in Danish Kroner, and interest on such principal amount will be payable at a fixed rate of 0.67% per annum for the entire term, subject only to potential changes based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio. Additionally, the Company entered into a hedging agreement to manage the variable interest rate risk associated with its payments with respect to the $15.0 million term loan. Under this combined arrangement, interest will be payable at a fixed rate of 2.04% per annum for the entire term, plus an incremental margin of 1.0% to 1.5%, based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.  
The obligations of ANI ApS in respect of the $9.2 million term loan are guaranteed by the Company and TrojanLabel ApS. The Companys obligations in respect of the $15.0 million term loan, revolving credit facility and its guarantee in respect of the ANI ApS term loan are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (including a pledge of a portion of the equity interests held by the Company in ANI ApS and the Companys wholly owned German subsidiary, AstroNova GmbH), subject to certain exceptions.  
The Lender is entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans and to terminate its revolving credit commitment under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of various customary events of default.

The Parties must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.  
On December 9, 2019, the Company, ANI ApS, TrojanLabel ApS and the Lender, entered into a Fourth Amendment (the Fourth Amendment) to the Credit Agreement. Refer to Part II, Item 5 Other Information for further details on the Fourth Amendment and resulting changes to the terms of the Credit Agreement.  
The Company believes it is in compliance with all of the covenants in the amended Credit Agreement.  
The Companys statements of cash flows for the nine months ended November 2, 2019 and October 27, 2018 are included on page 8 of this report. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 compared to $2.5 million for the same period of the previous year. The decrease in net cash provided by operations for the first nine months of the current year is primarily due to the decrease in net income, and an increase in cash used for working capital. The combination of changes in accounts receivable, inventory, income taxes, accounts payable and accrued expenses negatively impacted cash by $8.4 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2020, compared to $6.8 million for the same period in fiscal 2019.  
The accounts receivable balance decreased to $22.1 million at the end of the third quarter compared to $23.5 million at year end. The $1.4 million decrease in the accounts receivable balance from year end is directly related to the decrease in sales for the third quarter of the current year as compared to third quarter sales in fiscal 2019.  
The net decreased cash position at November 2, 2019 primarily resulted from principal payments of long-term debt and the guaranteed royalty obligation of $4.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively; cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $2.4 million and dividends paid of $1.5 million, offset by increased cash provided by current period borrowing on the Companys existing revolving credit facility of $5.0 million.
