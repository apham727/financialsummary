Supplies revenue in the first half of the current year was $37.8 million, representing a 9.3% increase over the prior years first six months revenue of $34.6 million. The current year increase in supplies revenue is due primarily to the increase in inkjet printer supplies and labels sales, tempered by lower thermal film and electrophotographic supplies revenue in the Product Identification segment.  
Current year first six months gross profit was $26.2 million, a 2.8% increase from prior years first six months gross profit of $25.5 million. The Companys gross profit margin of 37.6% in the current year reflects a decrease from the prior years first six months gross profit margin of 39.1%. The lower gross profit margin for the current year compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher period costs and product mix.

Indebtedness  
In fiscal 2018, the Company and the Companys wholly owned Danish subsidiaries, ANI ApS and TrojanLabel ApS, entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (the Lender), which, as amended, provides for a secured credit facility consisting of a term loan to ANI ApS in the principal amount of $9.2 million and a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million. The Credit Agreement also provides for a $10.0 million revolving credit facility for the Company.  
Both term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.  
Table of Contents 
In connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement, ANI ApS entered into a hedging agreement to manage the variable interest rate risk and currency risk associated with its payments in respect to the term loan. Under this combined arrangement, payments of principal and interest with respect to approximately $8.9 million of the principal of the term loan will be made in Danish Kroner, and interest on such principal amount will be payable at a fixed rate of 0.67% per annum for the entire term, subject only to potential changes based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio. Additionally, the Company entered into a hedging agreement to manage the variable interest rate risk associated with its payments with respect to the $15.0 million term loan. Under this combined arrangement, interest will be payable at a fixed rate of 2.04% per annum for the entire term, plus an incremental margin of 1.0% to 1.5%, based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.  
The obligations of ANI ApS in respect of the $9.2 million term loan are guaranteed by the Company and TrojanLabel ApS. The Companys obligations in respect of the $15.0 million term loan, revolving credit facility and its guarantee in respect of the ANI ApS term loan are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (including a pledge of a portion of the equity interests held by the Company in ANI ApS and the Companys wholly owned German subsidiary, AstroNova GmbH), subject to certain exceptions.  
The Lender is entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans and to terminate its revolving credit commitment under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of various customary events of default.  
The Parties must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.  
As of August 3, 2019, the Company believes it is in compliance with all of the covenants in the Credit Agreement.  
The Companys statements of cash flows for the six months ended August 3, 2019 and July 28, 2018 are included on page 7 of this report. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.0 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020 compared to cash used by operating activities of $1.7 million for the same period of the previous year. The increase in net cash provided by operations for the first six months of the current year is primarily due to the increase in net income, and a decrease in cash used for working capital. The combination of changes in accounts receivable, inventory, income taxes payable accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased cash by $5.6 million for the first six months of fiscal 2020, compared to a decrease of $7.4 million for the same period in fiscal 2019.  
The accounts receivable balance decreased to $20.6 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $23.5 million at year end. The $2.9 million decrease in the accounts receivable balance from year end is directly related to the decrease in sales for the second quarter of the current year as compared to fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2019.  
The net decreased cash position at August 3, 2019 primarily resulted from principal payments of long-term debt and the guaranteed royalty obligation of $2.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively; cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $1.5 million and dividends paid of $1.0 million, offset by increased cash provided by operations as discussed above and the current period borrowing on the Companys existing revolving credit facility of $2.0 million.
