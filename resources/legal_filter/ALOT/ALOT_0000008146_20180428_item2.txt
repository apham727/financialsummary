Financial Condition and Liquidity  
Overview  
Indebtedness  
On February 28, 2017, the Company and its wholly owned Danish subsidiaries, ANI ApS and TrojanLabel ApS (together, the Parties), entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (the Lender). The Credit Agreement provided for a term loan to ANI ApS in the principal amount of $9.2 million. The Credit Agreement also provided for a $10.0 million revolving credit facility available to the Company for general corporate purposes.  
In connection with the Honeywell Purchase and License Agreement, on September 28, 2017, the Parties entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender. The First Amendment amended the existing Credit Agreement to permit the Honeywell Agreement and temporarily increased the amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility from $10.0 million to $15.0 million. The initial upfront payment of $14.6 million for the Honeywell Agreement was paid using borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility.  
On November 30, 2017, the Parties entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender. The Second Amendment provided for a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million, in addition to the revolving credit facility for the Company and the term loan previously borrowed by ANI ApS at the original closing under the Credit Agreement. The proceeds from the term loan were used to repay the entire $14.6 million principal balance of the revolving loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The principal amount of the revolving credit facility which had been temporarily increased to $15.0 million was reduced to $10.0 million effective upon closing of the Second Amendment and the maturity date was extended to November 30, 2022.  
On April 17, 2018, the Parties entered into a Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender. The Third Amendment provides that no Immaterial Subsidiary will be required to become a guarantor or securing party under (unless requested by the Lender during default) or have its equity pledged pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment defines Immaterial Subsidiary as any subsidiary of the Company with (a) consolidated total assets that do not exceed 5.0% of the consolidated total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and (b) revenues that do not exceed 5.0% of the consolidated revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries, as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter; provided that Immaterial Subsidiaries shall not account for, in the aggregate, more than 10% the of consolidated total assets or consolidated revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries.  
In connection with the Credit Agreement, AstroNova and ANI ApS entered into certain hedging arrangements with the Lender to manage the variable interest rate risk and currency risk associated with its payments in respect of the term loans.  
The obligations of ANI ApS in respect of the $9.2 million term loan are guaranteed by the Company and TrojanLabel. The Companys obligations in respect of the $15.0 million term loan, revolving credit facility and its guarantee in respect of the ANI ApS term loan are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company (including a pledge of a portion of the equity interests held by the Company in ANI ApS and the Companys wholly-owned German subsidiary Astro-Med GmbH), subject to certain exceptions.  
The Parties must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.  
The Lender is entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans and to terminate its revolving credit commitment under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of various customary events of default.  
As of April 28, 2018, there were no borrowings against the revolving credit facility and we believe the Company is in compliance with all of the covenants in the Credit Agreement.

The Companys statements of cash flows for the three months ended April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017 are included on page 6 of this report. Net cash used by operating activities was $2.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $0.8 million for the same period of the previous year. The increase in net cash used by operations for the current quarter is primarily due to increased cash used for working capital and increase in non-cash amortization related to the Honeywell acquisition. The combination of changes in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased cash by $5.0 million in for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to a decrease of $2.1 million for the same period in fiscal 2018. The accounts receivable balance increased to $25.3 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $22.4 at year end and the collection cycle increased to 63 days compared to 55 days at year end. The inventory balance was $27.7 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to $27.6 million at year end and inventory days on hand increased to 129 days at the end of the current quarter from 124 days at the prior year end.  
The decreased cash and investment position at April 28, 2018, primarily resulted from increased cash used in operations as discussed above, principal payments of long-term debt of $1.8 million, dividends paid of $0.5 million and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $0.5 million.
