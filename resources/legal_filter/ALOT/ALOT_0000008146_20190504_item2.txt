Segment Analysis  
Revenue from the Product Identification segment increased 18.2% in the first quarter of the current year, with revenue of $23.6 million compared to $20.0 million in the same period of the prior year. The current quarter increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the increase in supplies revenue, specifically, labels and tag supplies revenue and inkjet supply revenue, both experiencing double digit growth as compared to the same period in the prior year. Also contributing to the increase in revenue for the current quarter was the 6.1% increase in hardware revenue as a result of the Companys new five-color digital label printer, as well as an increase in sales of monochromatic printers. Hardware revenue increases were slightly tempered by lower sales of the Companys other digital color printers within the product group. The current quarter also experienced growth in parts revenue compared to the same period in the prior year. Product Identifications current quarter segment operating profit was $2.9 million, reflecting a profit margin of 12.2%. This compares to prior years first quarter segment profit of $1.7 million and related profit margin of 8.3%. The increase in Product Identification current year first quarter segment operating margin is primarily due to higher sales, product mix and lower manufacturing and period costs.

Both term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.

The Companys statements of cash flows for the three months ended May 4, 2019 and April 28, 2018 are included on page 7 of this report. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to cash used by operating activities of $1.6 million for the same period of the previous year. The increase in net cash provided by operations for the current quarter is primarily due to the increase in net income and the decrease in cash used for working capital.

The accounts receivable balance decreased to $22.0 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $23.5 million at year end and the collection cycle increased to 53 days compared to 49 days at year end. The inventory balance was $32.0 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to $30.2 million at year end and inventory days on hand increased to 131 days at the end of the current quarter from 120 days at the prior year end.  
The decreased cash and investment position at May 4, 2019 primarily resulted from increased cash provided by in operations as discussed above, offset by principal payments of long-term debt of $1.6 million, principal payment of guaranteed royalty obligation of $0.4 million, dividends paid of $0.5 million and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $0.6 million.  
The Companys backlog increased 30% from year-end to $33.3 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
