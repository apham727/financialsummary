Note 7  Revolving Line of Credit  
The Company has a revolving line of credit under its existing Credit Agreement with Bank of America. Revolving credit loans may be borrowed, at the Companys option, in U.S. Dollars or, subject to certain conditions, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars or Danish Kroner. Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, either (a) the LIBOR rate (or, in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, the applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of Americas publicly announced prime rate or (iii) the LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.0% to 0.5% based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio.  
At November 2, 2019, $6.5 million has been drawn on the revolving line of credit. The outstanding balance bears interest at a weighted average annual rate of 5.26% and $93,000 and $39,000 of interest has been incurred on this obligation and included in other expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated income statement for the nine month periods ended November 2, 2019 and October 27, 2018, respectively. At November 2, 2019, there was $3.5 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility.  
Following the completion of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement to, among other things, temporarily increase the revolving line of credit from $10.0 million to $17.5 million and modify certain of the financial covenants with which the Company must comply thereunder. For additional information on the amendment and the resulting changes to the terms of the agreement, see Note 17  Subsequent Events.  
The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility at the rate of 0.25% per annum.  
Note 8  Debt  
Table of Contents 
Following the completion of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company entered into a Fourth Amendment to its Credit Agreement with Bank of America governing the Companys long-term debt. Refer to Note 17  Subsequent Events for additional information on the Fourth Amendment and the resulting changes to the terms of the Credit Agreement.

Note 9  Derivative Financial Instruments and Risk Management  
The Company has entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap to manage the interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the floating-rate foreign currency-denominated term loan borrowing by our Danish Subsidiary and an interest rate swap to manage the interest rate risk associated with the variable rate term loan borrowing by the Company. Both swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of floating-rate borrowings.  
The cross-currency interest rate swap agreement utilized by the Company effectively modifies the Companys exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk by converting the Companys floating-rate debt denominated in U.S. Dollars on our Danish subsidiarys books to a fixed-rate debt denominated in Danish Kroner for the term of the loan, thus reducing the impact of interest-rate and foreign currency exchange rate changes on future interest expense and principal repayments. This swap involves the receipt of floating rate amounts in U.S. Dollars in exchange for fixed-rate interest payments in Danish Kroner, as well as exchanges of principal at the inception spot rate, over the life of the term loan.  
The interest rate swap agreement utilized by the Company on its term loan effectively modifies the Companys exposure to interest rate risk by converting the Companys floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt for the next five years, thus reducing the impact of interest-rate changes on future interest expense. This swap involves the receipt of floating rate amounts in U.S. Dollars in exchange for fixed rate payments in U.S. dollars over the life of the term loan.

Note 10  Royalty Obligation  
The guaranteed minimum royalty payment obligation was recorded at the present value of the minimum annual royalty payments using a present value factor of 2.8%, which is based on the estimated after-tax cost of debt for similar companies. As of November 2, 2019, the Company had paid an aggregate of $3.0 million of the guaranteed minimum royalty obligation. At November 2, 2019, the current portion of the outstanding guaranteed minimum royalty obligation of $2.0 million is to be paid over the next twelve months and is reported as a current liability and the remainder of $8.5 million is reported as a long-term liability on the Companys condensed consolidated balance sheet. In addition to the guaranteed minimum royalty payments, the Company also incurred excess royalty expense of $0.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine month periods ended November 2, 2019 and $0.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine month periods ended October 27, 2018 which is included in cost of revenue in the Companys condensed consolidated statements of income. A total of $0.4 million of excess royalty is payable and reported as a current liability on the Companys condensed consolidated balance sheet at November 2, 2019.  
On February 1, 2019 the Company adopted ASC 842, Leases. This new guidance requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases, with the result being the recognition of a right of use (ROU) asset and a lease liability. The lease liability is equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments for the term of the lease, including any optional renewal periods determined to be reasonably certain to be exercised, using a discount rate determined at lease commencement. This discount rate is the rate implicit in the lease, if known; otherwise, the incremental borrowing rate for the expected lease term is used. The Companys incremental borrowing rate approximates the rate the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term at lease inception. The value of the ROU asset is equal to the initial measurement of the lease liability plus any lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date and any unamortized initial direct costs incurred by the lessee, less any unamortized lease incentives received.  
There are two types of leases, operating leases and finance leases. Lease classification is determined at lease commencement. All of the Companys leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in general and administrative expense on the condensed consolidated statement of income. For operating leases, ROU assets are classified in other long-term assets, short-term lease liabilities are classified in other current liabilities, and long-term lease liabilities are classified in other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. On the cash flow statement, payments for operating leases are classified as operating activities.

In addition, several of our lease agreements include non-lease components for items such as common area maintenance and utilities which are accounted for separately from the lease component.  
The Company applied ASC 842 to all leases in effect at February 1, 2019 and adopted the accounting standard using the non-comparative transition option, which does not require the restatement of prior years. Comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under the previous accounting guidance. The Company has elected the package of practical expedients, which allows entities to not reassess (1) whether contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. The Company has made an accounting policy election to apply the short-term exception, which does not require the capitalization of leases with terms of 12 months or less. On February 1, 2019, the Company recognized $2.0 million of ROU assets and lease liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations or cash flows.  
The company leases office space from an affiliate. This lease is classified as an operating lease with annual rental payments of approximately $64,000 and $66,000 in fiscal 2020 and 2021, respectively.  
Table of Contents 
As of November 2, 2019, the weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for our operating leases are 5.7 years and 3.98%, respectively. We calculated the weighted-average discount rate using incremental borrowing rates, which equal the rates of interest that we would pay to borrow funds on a fully collateralized basis over a similar term.

Assets and Liabilities Not Recorded at Fair Value  
The fair value of the Companys long-term debt, including the current portion, is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans with the same maturities would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and is classified as Level 3.  
On December 9, 2019, the Company and its wholly owned Danish subsidiaries, ANI ApS and TrojanLabel ApS (the Parties), entered into a Fourth Amendment (the Fourth Amendment) to the Credit Agreement dated as of February 28, 2017 between the Parties and Bank of America, N.A. (as previously amended, the Credit Agreement). The Fourth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate amount available for borrowings under the revolving line of credit prior to November 1, 2020 from $10.0 million to $17.5 million and (ii) modify the financial covenants with which the Company must comply thereunder by excluding certain capital expenditures from the calculation of the Companys consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, providing that the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio covenant will be suspended through the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and adding a minimum consolidated EBITDA covenant commencing with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and continuing through the second quarter of fiscal 2021.
