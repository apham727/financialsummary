Revenue through domestic channels for the current year third quarter was $21.5 million, an increase of 18.9% over the prior year’s third quarter. International revenue for the third quarter of the current year was $12.7 million, also an 18.9% increase over the previous year’s third quarter and represents 37% of AstroNova’s third quarter revenue. Current year third quarter international revenue includes an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact of $0.2 million.  
Other expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.5 million compared to $12 thousand in the prior year third quarter. Current quarter other expense includes interest expense on debt of $0.2 million and foreign exchange loss of $0.3 million. Other income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 includes $0.1 million of interest expense on debt and $0.2 million of foreign exchange loss, offset by $0.3 million of investment income and income received from the settlement of a legal matter related to patent infringement. 
The Company reported net income of $1.4 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the third quarter of the current year, consistent with net income for the prior year third quarter of $1.4 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Net income was 4.1% of revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 4.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.

Supplies revenue in the first nine months of the current year was $52.7 million, representing a 10.4% increase over the prior year’s first nine months revenue of $47.7 million. The current year increase in supplies revenue is related primarily to increases in digital color printer supplies product revenue, and label and tag revenue in the Product Identification segment.  
Gross profit for the first nine months of the current year was $39.4 million, a 25.7% increase from prior year’s first nine months gross profit of $31.4 million. The Company’s current year gross profit margin of 39.6% reflects an increase from the prior year’s first nine months gross profit margin of 38.9%. The higher gross profit and related margin for the current year compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher sales and favorable product mix.  
The Company reported net income of $3.4 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the first nine months of the current year, which included $0.8 million of after-tax income, or $0.12 per diluted share, as a result of a change in accounting estimates in the first quarter for product cost and operating expenses related to a transition services agreement entered into with Honeywell in connection with the Honeywell Agreement. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, a change in accounting estimate for revenue subject to customer rebates under the Honeywell Agreement increased net income by $0.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share. In the prior year’s first nine months, the Company recognized net income of $2.7 million, or $0.38 per diluted share.

Indebtedness  
On February 28, 2017, the Company and its wholly owned Danish subsidiaries, ANI ApS and TrojanLabel ApS (together, the “Parties”), entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (the “Lender”). The Credit Agreement provided for a term loan to ANI ApS in the principal amount of $9.2 million. The Credit Agreement also provided for a $10.0 million revolving credit facility available to the Company for general corporate purposes.  
In connection with the Honeywell Purchase and License Agreement, on September 28, 2017, the Parties entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender. The First Amendment amended the existing Credit Agreement to permit the Honeywell Agreement and temporarily increased the amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility from $10.0 million to $15.0 million. The initial upfront payment of $14.6 million for the Honeywell Agreement was paid using borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility.  
On November 30, 2017, the Parties entered into a Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender. The Second Amendment provided for a term loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15.0 million, in addition to the revolving credit facility for the Company and the term loan previously borrowed by ANI ApS at the original closing under the Credit Agreement. The proceeds from the term loan were used to repay the entire $14.6 million principal balance of the revolving loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The principal amount of the revolving credit facility which had been temporarily increased to $15.0 million was reduced to $10.0 million effective upon closing of the Second Amendment and the maturity date was extended to November 30, 2022.  
On April 17, 2018, the Parties entered into a Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement with the Lender. The Third Amendment provides that no “Immaterial Subsidiary” will be required to become a guarantor or securing party under (unless requested by the Lender during default) or have its equity pledged pursuant to the Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment defines “Immaterial Subsidiary” as any subsidiary of the Company with (a) consolidated total assets that do not exceed 5.0% of the consolidated total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and (b) revenues that do not exceed 5.0% of the consolidated revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries, as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter; provided that Immaterial Subsidiaries shall not account for, in the aggregate, more than 10% the of consolidated total assets or consolidated revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries.  
Revolving credit loans may be borrowed, at the Company’s option, in U.S. Dollars or, subject to certain conditions, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars or Danish Krone. Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, either (a) the LIBOR rate (or in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, the applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.0% to 1.5% based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds’ rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of America’s publicly announced prime rate or (iii) the LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.0% to 0.5% based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility at the rate of 0.25% per annum. Outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit line during fiscal 2019 bear interest at an annual rate of 5.5% and the Company has accrued $38 thousand on the outstanding obligation for the nine months ended October 27, 2018.  
The Parties must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.  
The Lender is entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans and to terminate its revolving credit commitment under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of various customary events of default.  
As of October 27, 2018, we believe the Company is in compliance with all of the covenants in the Credit Agreement.  
The Company’s statements of cash flows for the nine months ended October 27, 2018 and October 28, 2017 are included on page 6 of this report. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to $2.0 million for the same period of the previous year. The decrease in net cash provided by operations for the first nine months of the current year is primarily due to payments of prior quarters’ accrued expenses to Honeywell under the TSA agreement and the increase in inventory to support the transition of the production of printers to the West Warwick facility in accordance with the Honeywell TSA. The combination of these factors on working capital decreased cash by $7.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to a decrease of $2.4 million for the same period in fiscal 2018. The current year decrease in cash provided by operations was slightly offset by an increase in non-cash amortization related to the Honeywell acquisition. The accounts receivable balance was $21.7 million at the end of the third quarter compared to $22.4 million at year end and the collection cycle decreased to 50 days compared to 55 days at year end. The inventory balance increased to $28.3 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to $27.6 million at year end and inventory days on hand increased to 126 days at the end of the current quarter from 124 days at the prior year end.  
The decreased cash and investment position at October 27, 2018 as compared to year end, primarily resulted from increased cash used in operations as discussed above, principal payments of long-term debt of $4.0 million, dividends paid of $1.4 million and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $1.9 million.  
The Company’s backlog increased 15.1% from year-end to $24.5 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
