The Plans are profit sharing retirement plans that are qualified under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
The assets of the Plans are held in a single trust fund for the benefit of our employees, and no Plan holds assets for the benefit of the employees of any other employer.
