3.New Accounting Pronouncements



Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2018



In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, (“ASU 2016-09”), which changes certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 effective as of September 1, 2017.
As such, cash flows from operations for three months ended November 30, 2016 increased $17.1 million, with a corresponding decrease to cash flows from financing activities, compared to amounts previously reported.
Accounting Standards Yet to Be Adopted



In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-07, Compensation — Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”), which will change the presentation of net periodic benefit cost related to employer sponsored defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits.
Additionally, only service costs may be capitalized in assets.
ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2017.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business (“ASU 2017-01”), which requires an evaluation of whether substantially all of the fair value of assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets.
If so, the transaction does not qualify as a business.
The guidance also requires an acquired business to include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs.
The Company is required to apply this guidance to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2017-01 and intends to implement the standard as required in fiscal 2019.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (“ASU 2016-15”), which is intended to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows including debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance.
ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2017.
The Company intends to implement the standard as required in fiscal 2019, and the provisions of ASU 2016-15 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statement disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”), which requires lessees to include most leases on the balance sheet.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2018.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2016-02 and intends to implement the standard as required in fiscal 2020.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)



In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”), which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP.
ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
ASU 2014-09 permits two transition methods: the full retrospective method and the modified retrospective method.
Under the full retrospective method, the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented with the cumulative effect of applying the standard recognized at the earliest period shown.
Under the modified retrospective method, the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which clarifies the guidance in ASU 2014-09 and has the same effective date as the original standard.
During the three months ended July 1, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing; ASU 2016-11, Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting; and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.
These amendments are intended to improve and clarify the implementation guidance of ASU 2014-09 and have the same effective date as the original standard.
The Company has an implementation team tasked with identifying potential differences that will result from applying the new revenue recognition standard to the Company's contracts with its customers.
The implementation team reports the findings and progress of the project to management on a frequent basis and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.
The implementation team has completed its initial phase of contract reviews and continues to evaluate the results of those reviews with respect to potential changes from adopting the new standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, the implementation team is in the process of identifying appropriate changes to the Company's business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard.
Based on the implementation team's current findings and the overall expected immaterial impact of adoption, the implementation team is currently evaluating which adoption method would provide the most meaningful information to the Company's stakeholders.
The Company will adopt the requirements of the new standard no later than the effective date of September 1, 2018.
4.Fair Value Measurements



The Company determines fair value measurements based on the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability.
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), establishes a three level hierarchy making a distinction between market participant assumptions based on (i) unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market (Level 1), (ii) quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (Level 2), and (iii) prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement (Level 3).
The Company's cash and cash equivalents (Level 1), which are required to be carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis, were $428.6 million and $311.1 million as of November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, respectively.
The Company utilizes valuation methodologies to determine the fair values of its financial assets and liabilities in conformity with the concepts of “exit price” and the fair value hierarchy as prescribed in ASC 820.
There were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values during the current period.
6

ACUITY BRANDS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)



The Company used quoted market prices to determine the fair value of Level 1 assets and liabilities.
No transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy occurred during the current fiscal period.
In the event of a transfer in or out of a level within the fair value hierarchy, the transfers would be recognized on the date of occurrence.
Disclosures of fair value information about financial instruments (whether or not recognized in the balance sheet), for which it is practicable to estimate that value, are required each reporting period in addition to any financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis as prescribed by ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments (“ASC 825”).
In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.
Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.
The carrying values and estimated fair values of certain of the Company’s financial instruments were as follows at November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017 (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The senior unsecured public notes are carried at the outstanding balance, net of unamortized bond discount and deferred costs, as of the end of the reporting period.
Fair value is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity (Level 2).
The industrial revenue bond is carried at the outstanding balance as of the end of the reporting period.
The industrial revenue bond is a tax-exempt, variable-rate instrument that resets on a weekly basis; therefore, the Company estimates that the face amount of the bond approximates fair value as of November 30, 2017 based on bonds of similar terms and maturity (Level 2).
The bank loans are carried at the outstanding balance as of the end of the reporting period.
Fair value is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity (Level 2).
ASC 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements.
Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value to the Company.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names that are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.
The Company recorded amortization expense of $6.6 million and $5.9 million during the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Amortization expense is generally recorded on a straight-line basis and is expected to be approximately $26.2 million in fiscal 2018, $26.1 million in fiscal 2019, $25.8 million in fiscal 2020, $23.0 million in fiscal 2021, and $21.2 million in fiscal 2022.
7.Earnings Per Share



Basic earnings per share for the periods presented is computed by dividing net earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Other comprehensive income (loss) for the Company includes foreign currency translation and pension adjustments.
The following table presents the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) during the three months ended November 30, 2017 (in millions):

9.Debt



Lines of Credit



On August 27, 2014, the Company executed a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).
The Revolving Credit Facility will mature, and all amounts outstanding will be due and payable, on August 27, 2019.
Generally, amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a Eurocurrency Rate.
Eurocurrency Rate advances can be denominated in a variety of currencies, including U.S.
Dollars, and amounts outstanding bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for the applicable currency plus a margin as determined by the Company's leverage ratio (“Applicable Margin”).
The Applicable Margin is based on the Company’s leverage ratio, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility, with such margin ranging from 1.000% to 1.575%.
The Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of November 30, 2017.
Additionally, the Company is required to pay certain fees in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility, including administrative service fees and an annual facility fee.
The annual facility fee is payable quarterly, in arrears, and is determined by the Company’s leverage ratio as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility.
This facility fee ranges from 0.125% to 0.300% of the aggregate $250.0 million commitment of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility.
The Revolving Credit Facility contains financial covenants, including a minimum interest coverage ratio (“Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio”) and a leverage ratio (“Maximum Leverage Ratio”) of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense (“EBITDA”), as such terms are defined in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement.
These ratios are computed at the end of each fiscal quarter for the most recent 12-month period.
The Revolving Credit Facility allows for a Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio of 2.50 and a Maximum Leverage Ratio of 3.50, subject to certain conditions defined in the financing agreement.
As of November 30, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.
As of November 30, 2017, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $10.2 million, primarily for securing collateral requirements under the Company's casualty insurance programs and for providing credit support for the Company’s industrial revenue bond (not an outstanding amount under the Revolving Credit Facility).
At November 30, 2017, the Company had additional borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility of $244.7 million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the time, which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility less outstanding letters of credit of $5.3 million issued under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Long-term Debt



At November 30, 2017, the Company had $350.0 million of publicly-traded, senior unsecured notes outstanding at a 6% interest rate that are scheduled to mature in December 2019 (the “Unsecured Notes”) and $4.0 million of tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds that are scheduled to mature in 2021.
The Company also had $3.7 million outstanding under fixed-rate bank loans.
Further discussion of the Company's long-term debt is included within the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within the Company’s Form 10-K. 



Interest Expense, net



Interest expense, net, is comprised primarily of interest expense on long-term debt, obligations in connection with non-qualified retirement benefits, and Revolving Credit Facility borrowings, partially offset by interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents.
The Company is conducting a detailed review of this activity to determine the extent of any liabilities and the appropriate remedial measures.
At this time, the Company is unable to determine the likelihood or amount of any loss associated with these shipments.
Product Warranty and Recall Costs 



The Company's products generally have a standard warranty term of five years.
The Company records an allowance for the estimated amount of future warranty costs when the related revenue is recognized.
Estimated future warranty and recall costs are primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty and recall claims.
In certain limited cases, the Company has warranty arrangements for terms that exceed the standard term.
The plaintiff seeks class certification, unspecified monetary damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees.
The Company disputes the allegations in the complaint and intends to vigorously defend against the claims.
The Company establishes reserves for legal claims when associated costs become probable and can be reasonably estimated.
However, the Company cannot make a meaningful estimate of actual costs to be incurred that could possibly be higher or lower than the amounts reserved.
11.Share-based Payments



The Company accounts for share-based payments through the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for share-based payment awards made to employees and directors of the Company, including stock options and restricted shares (all part of the Company's equity incentive plan), and share units representing certain deferrals into the Company's director deferred compensation plan or the Company's supplemental deferred savings plan.
The following table presents share-based payment expense and new shares issued upon exercise of stock options for the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016 (in millions, except shares):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Further details regarding each of these award programs and the Company's share-based payments are included within the Share-based Payments footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within the Company’s Form 10-K.



12.Pension Plans



The Company has several pension plans, both qualified and non-qualified, covering certain hourly and salaried employees.
Benefits paid under these plans are based generally on employees’ years of service and/or compensation during the final years of employment.
Plan assets are invested primarily in equity and fixed income securities.
Net periodic pension cost for the Company’s defined benefit pension plans during the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016 included the following components before tax (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Further details regarding the Company's pension plans are included within the Pension and Defined Contribution Plans footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within the Company’s Form 10-K.

13.Special Charge



During fiscal 2017, the Company recognized pre-tax special charges consisting primarily of severance and employee-related benefit costs for the elimination of certain operations and positions following a realignment of the Company's operating structure, including positions within various selling, distribution, and administrative (“SD&A”) departments.
During fiscal 2016, the Company recognized pre-tax special charges primarily related to the Company's continued efforts to integrate recent acquisitions and to streamline the organization by realigning certain responsibilities primarily within various SD&A departments, as well as the consolidation of certain production activities.
The Company did not initiate any such actions during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The details of the special charge during the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of November 30, 2017, remaining restructuring reserves were $10.2 million and are included in Accrued compensation and Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The changes in the reserves related to these programs during the three months ended November 30, 2017 are summarized as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



14.Subsequent Events



On December 22, 2017, the President of the U.S. signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R.
1) (the “Act”), which is expected to have a materially favorable impact to the Company's net income, cash flows, and diluted earnings per share in future periods.
The Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.

15.Supplemental Guarantor Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements



In December 2009, ABL, the 100% owned and principal operating subsidiary of Acuity Brands, refinanced the then current outstanding debt through the issuance of the Notes.
See Debt and Lines of Credit footnote for further information.
In accordance with the registration rights agreement by and between ABL and the guarantors to the Notes and the initial purchasers of the Notes, ABL and the guarantors to the Notes filed a registration statement with the SEC for an offer to exchange the Notes for an issue of SEC-registered notes with identical terms.
Due to the filing of the registration statement and offer to exchange, the Company determined the need for compliance with Rule 3-10 of SEC Regulation S-X (“Rule 3-10”).
In lieu of providing separate audited financial statements for ABL and ABL IP Holding, the Company has included the accompanying Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements in accordance with Rule 3-10(d) of SEC Regulation S-X since the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Acuity Brands and ABL IP Holding.
The column marked “Parent” represents the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of Acuity Brands.
The column marked “Subsidiary Issuer” represents the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of ABL.
The column entitled “Subsidiary Guarantor” represents the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of ABL IP Holding.
Lastly, the column listed as “Non-Guarantors” includes the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the non-guarantor direct and indirect subsidiaries of Acuity Brands, which consist primarily of foreign subsidiaries.
Consolidating adjustments were necessary in order to arrive at consolidated amounts.
In addition, the equity method of accounting was used to calculate investments in subsidiaries.
