 Avnet, Inc., founded in 1921 and incorporated in New York in 1955, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company” or “Avnet”), is a global value-added distributor of electronic components that supports customers at each stage of a product’s lifecycle. Avnet creates a vital link in the technology supply chain that connects the world’s leading electronic component manufacturers with a global customer base primarily comprised of original equipment manufacturers, electronic manufacturing services providers and original design manufacturers. Avnet distributes electronic components, as received from its suppliers or through a customized integrated solution, and offers assembly, design, supply chain and other value-added services.  
 Sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $4.80 billion, an increase of 8.0% from sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 of $4.44 billion. The increase in sales was due to the increased sales in PF and the EMEA and Asia regions of EC, offset by sales declines in the EC Americas region. Sales in constant currency increased year over year by 2.4% with both EC and PF contributing to the increase.   
 Avnet operating loss margin was (1.1)% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared with 2.6% of operating income margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Both periods included amortization and restructuring, integration and other expenses. The third quarter of fiscal 2018 also includes goodwill impairment expense. Excluding these expenses from both periods, adjusted operating income margin was 3.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to 3.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.   
 Sales  
 The following table presents reported and organic sales growth rates between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 for the third quarters and first nine months of fiscal 2018.   
 The following table presents the reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2017.  
   (1)    Includes PF acquired on October 17, 2016, which has operations in each Avnet region. 
 Sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $4.80 billion, an increase of 8.0%, or $353.2 million, from the prior year third quarter sales of $4.44 billion. Excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, sales increased 2.4% over the prior year third quarter with both operating groups contributing to this increase.  
 EC sales of $4.40 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $313.2 million or 7.7% from the prior year third quarter sales of $4.09 billion. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales in Asia due to organic growth and in EMEA primarily due to the benefit from the weakening of the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by declines in the Americas region due to supplier channel and program changes. PF sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $391.0 million, an increase of $40.0 million or 11.4% from the prior year third quarter sales of $351.0 million driven by growth in all three regions including the benefit from the weakening U.S. Dollar.   
 Sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 were $13.98 billion, an increase of 8.9%, or $1.14 billion, as compared to sales of $12.83 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of PF, which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and an overall increase in sales in EC as double-digit growth in the EMEA and Asia regions of EC offset a year to date decrease of 8.9% in the EC Americas region. Organic sales for the first nine months of 2018 increased $765.8 million, or 5.8%, compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017 primarily due to double-digit sales growth in EMEA and Asia regions, offset by a decline of 7.9% in the Americas region.   
 Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margins  
 Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $653.5 million, an increase of $23.6 million, or 3.7%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 gross profit of $630.0 million primarily driven by the increase in sales. Gross profit margin decreased 55 basis points to 13.6% from the third quarter of fiscal 2017, with both operating groups contributing to the decrease.  
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  
 Impairment Expenses  
 As of December 30, 2017, the $181.4 million in goodwill related to the Electronic Components Americas core reporting unit (the “Americas”) primarily represented goodwill allocated from the acquisitions of Bell Micro, G2 and Round 2, all of which occurred prior to fiscal 2011. The allocation of goodwill to the Americas represented the expected synergies the Americas would realize from these historical acquisitions. Once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit, for accounting purposes, the goodwill is no longer directly associated with the underlying acquisitions that the goodwill originated from, but rather the reporting unit to which it has been allocated.   
 As a result of the interim impairment testing and related fair value estimate of the Americas as of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company impaired all of the goodwill in the Americas and recorded $181.4 million of goodwill impairment expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. See Note 4 “Goodwill and long-lived assets” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
 Restructuring, Integration and Other Expenses  
 The Company recorded restructuring, integration and other expenses of $25.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company recorded $5.9 million of restructuring costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 in order to realize approximately $7.2 million in expected annualized operating cost savings once such restructuring actions initiated before the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018 are completed. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company incurred integration costs of $2.5 million, accelerated depreciation of $13.1 million, other costs of $3.2 million and an expense of $0.4 million for changes in estimates for costs associated with prior year restructuring actions. The after tax impact of restructuring, integration and other expenses were $19.4 million and $0.16 per share on a diluted basis.  
 Comparatively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, restructuring, integration and other expenses from continuing operations were $35.5 million. The after tax impact of restructuring, integration, and other expenses was $23.1 million and $0.18 per share on a diluted basis.   
 In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, restructuring, integration and other expenses from continuing operations was $95.4 million. The after tax impact of restructuring, integration and other expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was $66.3 million and $0.52 per share on a diluted basis.  
 See Note 14 “Restructuring expenses” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.   
 Operating Income (Loss)  
 Operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $(54.4) million, a decrease of $168.7 million, or 147.6%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 operating income of $114.3 million. The year over year decrease in operating income was primarily driven by goodwill impairment expense, partially offset by improvements at PF and EC. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $174.9 million, an increase of $2.6 million, or 1.5%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2017.  
 Operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $102.6 million, or 0.7% of consolidated sales, as compared with operating income of $368.0 million, or 2.9% in the first nine months of 2017 primarily driven by declines in EC partially offset by the acquisition of PF.   
 Interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $26.0 million, a decrease of $1.5 million or 5.4%, as compared with interest expense of $27.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Interest expense in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $75.7 million, a decrease of $5.8 million or 7.1%, as compared with interest expense of $81.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. The decrease in interest expense in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017 was primarily related to the impact of the Company’s repayment of its outstanding term loans and borrowings on its revolving credit facilities, which were used to help fund the PF acquisition.  
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company had $8.4 million of other income, net, as compared with $19.4 million of other income, net, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, the Company had $24.7 million of other income, net, as compared with $30.8 million of other expense, net, in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. In the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, the Company had foreign currency gains primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar. In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company had other income due to unrealized gains on marketable securities obtained through the sale of TS. In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, the Company incurred additional financing and economic foreign currency hedging costs associated with the PF acquisition, partially offset by unrealized gains on marketable securities.   
 Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations  
 Loss from discontinued operations was $(4.5) million and $(14.4) million in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2018, respectively, primarily as a result of settlement losses associated with the Company’s pension plan due to former TS business employees requesting and receiving distributions from the Company’s pension plan during fiscal 2018. Refer to Note 9, “Pension Plan,” for further information on the pension settlement losses.  
 Income from discontinued operations was $181.9 million and $253.8 million in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2017, respectively, due to the operating results of the TS business, which was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Included in the income from discontinued operations in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2017, was $217.1 million for the estimated gain on sale of TS, net of taxes.

 For a detailed description of the Company’s long-term debt and lease commitments for the next five years and thereafter, see Long-Term Contractual Obligations appearing in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2017. With the exception of the Company’s debt transactions discussed herein, there are no material changes to this information outside of normal borrowings and repayments of long-term debt and operating lease payments. The Company does not currently have any material non-cancellable commitments for capital expenditures or inventory purchases.  
 Financing Transactions  
 The Company has various lines of credit and other forms of bank debt in the U.S. and various foreign locations to fund the short-term working capital, foreign exchange, overdraft and letter of credit needs of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Avnet generally guarantees its subsidiaries’ obligations under such debt facilities. Outstanding borrowings under such forms of debt at the end of third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $7.5 million.  
 Liquidity  
 The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $430.1 million as of March 31, 2018, of which $396.3 million was held outside the United States. As of July 1, 2017, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $836.4 million, of which $619.5 million was held outside of the United States.  
 As of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company had a combined total borrowing capacity of $1.65 billion under the Credit Facility and the Program. There were no borrowings outstanding and $2.0 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility and $95.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Program, resulting in approximately $1.55 billion of total availability as of March 31, 2018. Availability under the Program is subject to the Company having sufficient eligible trade accounts receivable to support desired borrowings. The Company currently expects to utilize availability under credit facilities to support working capital and other general corporate purposes to the extent such incremental borrowings do not impact the Company’s investment grade credit rating. During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $0.6 million and $3.0 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility and approximately $298.0 million and $230.0 million, respectively, under the Program.

 During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities. Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth. The Company used $98.5 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2018 for continuing operations.
