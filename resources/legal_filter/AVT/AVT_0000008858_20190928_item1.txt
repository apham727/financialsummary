1. Basis of presentation and new accounting pronouncements
Certain reclassifications have been made in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation.
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” and its related amendments (collectively “ASC 842”) on June 30, 2019 (the first day of fiscal 2020) using the modified transition approach without restating the comparative period consolidated financial statements. The standard requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability for all leases.
The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations or retained earnings. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance that allowed, among other things, the historical lease classification to be carried forward without reassessment and the hindsight practical expedient. The Company elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for its real estate leases. Refer to Note 5 for additional disclosures related to leases.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” and its related amendments (collectively “ASC 815”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASC 815 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Technology Solutions business (“TS business”) to Tech Data Corporation (the “Buyer”). The TS business and the financial impacts of the divestiture are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. In August 2018, the Company executed a settlement agreement with the Buyer resulting in a final adjustment of $120.0 million and a final geographic allocation of the TS business sales price for tax reporting purposes. This incremental consideration received from the sale of the TS business as well as cash settlements from the resolution of indemnification claims and other cash reimbursements have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations investing activities. Income tax payments related to the gain on sale of the TS business have been classified as cash flow from discontinued operations operating activities.
The following table presents the change in goodwill by reportable segment for the three months ended September 28, 2019. 
The Company evaluates each quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than their carrying value, which would require the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. Indicators the Company evaluates to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary include, but are not limited to, (i) a sustained decrease in share price or market capitalization as of any fiscal quarter end, (ii) changes in the macroeconomic or industry environments, (iii) the results of and the amount of time passed since the last goodwill impairment test and (iv) the long-term expected financial performance of its reporting units. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company concluded that an interim goodwill impairment test was not required.
The following table presents the Company’s acquired intangible assets at September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019, respectively. 
Bank credit facilities and other consists primarily of various committed and uncommitted lines of credit and other forms of bank debt with financial institutions utilized primarily to support the working capital requirements of the Company including its foreign operations.
The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Securitization Program”) in the United States with a group of financial institutions to allow the Company to transfer, on an ongoing revolving basis, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable, to provide security or collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of $500 million. The Securitization Program does not qualify for off balance sheet accounting treatment and any borrowings under the Securitization Program are recorded as debt in the consolidated balance sheets. Under the Securitization Program, the Company legally sells and isolates certain U.S. trade accounts receivable into a wholly owned and consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Such receivables, which are recorded within “Receivables” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $839.6 million and $857.3 million at September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019, respectively. The Securitization Program contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold. The Securitization Program also requires the Company to maintain certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019. The Securitization Program expires in August 2020 and as a result the Company has classified outstanding balances as short-term debt as of September 28, 2019. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a one-month LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.75%. The facility fee on the unused balance of the facility is up to 0.35%.
The Company has a five-year $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of banks, consisting of revolving credit facilities and the issuance of up to $200.0 million of letters of credit and up to $300.0 million of loans in certain approved currencies, which expires in June 2023. Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Facility may be increased up to $1.50 billion. Under the Credit Facility, the Company may select from various interest rate options, currencies and maturities. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants including various limitations on debt incurrence, share repurchases, dividends, investments and capital expenditures. The Credit Facility also includes financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of September 28, 2019 and June 29, 2019. As of September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019, there were $4.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility.
As of September 28, 2019, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.83 billion and $1.91 billion, respectively. At June 29, 2019, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.72 billion and $1.78 billion, respectively. Fair value for the public notes was estimated based upon quoted market prices and for other forms of debt fair value approximates carrying value due to the market based variable nature of the interest rates on those debt facilities.
Substantially all the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases and are predominately related to real property for distribution centers, office space and integration facilities with a remaining lease term of up to 19 years. The Company’s equipment leases are primarily for automobiles and equipment and are not material to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception based on whether it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration. Lease right-of-use assets (“operating lease assets”) and associated liabilities (“operating lease liabilities”) are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Certain lease agreements may include one or more options to extend or terminate a lease. Lease terms are inclusive of these options if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. 
The Company’s leases generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit borrowing rate, as such, the discount rate used to calculate present value is the Company’s incremental secured borrowing rate. The incremental secured borrowing rates used at the date of adoption for each lease varies in accordance with the remaining lease term and the currency of the lease payments. Lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included as a component of “Selling, general, and administrative expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations. Lease payments are primarily fixed; however, certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the measurement of operating lease assets and liabilities. 
Many of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies. This subjects the Company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging (e.g., offsetting receivables and payables in the same foreign currency) as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward foreign exchange contracts typically with maturities of less than 60 days (“economic hedges”), but no longer than one year. The Company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not economically hedged. The Company adjusts any economic hedges to fair value through the consolidated statements of operations primarily within “Other income (expense), net.” The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, which are based upon Level 2 criteria under the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy, are classified in the captions “Prepaid and other current assets” or “Accrued expenses and other,” as applicable, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of September 28, 2019 and June 29, 2019. The Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with various financial institutions related to derivative financial instruments allow for the right of offset. The Company’s policy is to present derivative financial instruments with the same counterparty as either a net asset or liability when the right of offset exists.
7. Commitments and contingencies
As of September 28, 2019, and June 29, 2019, the Company had aggregate estimated liabilities of $14.7 million classified within accrued expenses and other for such compliance-related matters that were reasonably estimable as of such dates.
The Company expects to make contributions to the Plan of $8.0 million during fiscal 2020. There were no contributions made during the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
In August 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $500 million increase in the Company’s existing share repurchase program, increasing the cumulative total of authorized share repurchases to $2.95 billion of common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors such as share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and prevailing market conditions. During the three months ended September 28, 2019, the Company repurchased 2.6 million shares under this program for a total cost of $112.1 million. As of September 28, 2019, the Company had $593.3 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.
In August 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.21 per common share and dividend payments of $21.5 million were made in September 2019. 
11. Earnings per share
12. Additional cash flow information
Severance expense recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 related to the reduction, or planned reduction, of over 200 employees, primarily in executive management, operations, information technology, warehouse, sales and business support functions. Asset impairments relate primarily to software assets that were impaired as a result of the restructuring of information technology operations including the re-prioritization of information technology initiatives and resources. Of the $18.3 million in restructuring expenses recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, $15.1 million related to EC and $3.2 million related to Farnell. The Company expects the majority of the remaining severance amounts to be paid by the end of fiscal 2020. 
The Company expects the majority of the remaining amounts to be paid by the end of fiscal 2020.
Pursuant to SEC regulations, including but not limited to Item 103 of Regulation S-K, the Company regularly assesses the status of and developments in pending environmental and other compliance related legal proceedings to determine whether any such proceedings should be identified specifically in this discussion of legal proceedings, and has concluded that no particular pending legal proceeding requires public disclosure. Based on the information known to date, 
management believes that the Company has appropriately accrued in its consolidated financial statements for its share of the estimable costs of environmental and other compliance related matters.
