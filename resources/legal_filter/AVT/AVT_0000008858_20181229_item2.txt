 The following table presents reported and organic sales growth rates between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.

 EC sales of $4.68 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $517.2 million or 12.4% from the prior year second quarter sales of $4.16 billion. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales across all EC regions including double digit growth in both the EMEA and Asia regions. PF sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 were $368.3 million, an increase of $10.1 million or 2.8% from the prior year second quarter sales of $358.1 million driven by growth in all three regions.   
 Sales for the first six months of fiscal 2019 were $10.14 billion, an increase of 10.4% as compared to sales of $9.18 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2018 primarily due to sales growth across all regions at both EC and PF.

 Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $96.1 million, an increase of $14.4 million, or 17.7%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 of $81.6 million. The year over year increase in operating income was primarily driven by the increase in sales and the reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year second quarter, partially offset by the decline in gross profit margin. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $178.8 million, an increase of $38.6 million, or 27.5%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2018.

 Loss from discontinued operations was $10.1 million and $9.9 million in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2018, respectively, primarily as a result of settlement losses associated with the Company’s pension plan due to former TS business employees requesting and receiving distributions from the Company’s pension plan during fiscal 2018.

 For a detailed description of the Company’s long-term debt and lease commitments for the next five years and thereafter, see Long-Term Contractual Obligations appearing in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. With the exception of the Company’s debt transactions discussed herein, there are no material changes to this information outside of normal borrowings and repayments of long-term debt and operating lease payments.

 Financing Transactions  
 See Note 5, “Debt” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on financing transactions including the Credit Facility, the Securitization Program, and other outstanding debt as of December 29, 2018. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program as of December 29, 2018 and June 30, 2018.  
 The Company has various lines of credit, financing arrangements and other forms of bank debt in the U.S. and various foreign locations to fund the short-term working capital, foreign exchange, overdraft and letter of credit needs of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Outstanding borrowings under such forms of debt at the end of second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.9 million.  
 As an alternative form of financing outside of the United States, the Company sells certain of its trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements. The Company accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables are recorded within “Interest and other financing expenses, net” and were not material.  
 Liquidity  
 The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $482.2 million as of December 29, 2018, of which $433.5 million was held outside the United States. As of June 30, 2018, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $621.1 million, of which $545.3 million was held outside of the United States.  
 As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company had a combined total borrowing capacity of $1.75 billion under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program. There were no borrowings outstanding and $3.0 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility and $471.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Securitization Program, resulting in approximately $1.28 billion of total availability as of December 29, 2018. Availability under the Securitization Program is subject to the Company having sufficient eligible trade accounts receivable to support desired borrowings. The Company currently expects to utilize availability under credit facilities to support working capital and other general corporate purposes to the extent such incremental borrowings do not impact the Company’s investment grade credit rating. During the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $184.0 million and 91.5 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility and approximately $256.0 million and $161.0 million, respectively, under the Securitization Program. During the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $0.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility and approximately $225.0 million and $195.0 million, respectively, under the Securitization Program.  
 During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities. Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth. The Company generated $299.9 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended December 29, 2018 from continuing operations.   
 In addition to continuing to make investments in acquisitions, as of December 29, 2018, the Company may repurchase up to an aggregate of $440.1 million of shares of the Company’s common stock through a $2.45 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors. The Company may repurchase stock from time to time at the discretion of management, subject to strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors. The Company may terminate or limit the share repurchase program at any time without prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors such as share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and prevailing market conditions. Additionally, the Company currently expects to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of its common stock, subject to approval of the Board of Directors. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.20 per share, which resulted in $21.8 million of dividend payments during the quarter.
