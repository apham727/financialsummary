 Goodwill Impairment Expense  
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company impaired all of the goodwill in the Americas reporting unit and recorded $181.4 million of goodwill impairment expense.  
 Each fiscal year, during the fiscal fourth quarter, the Company is required to perform an annual goodwill impairment test. The annual goodwill impairment testing typically includes consideration of the Company’s annual long-term planning as well as current market conditions when determining whether there is a goodwill impairment for any of the Company’s reporting units. The results of a quantitative annual goodwill impairment test may result in the impairment of goodwill at one or more of the Company’s reporting units even if a qualitative assessment concludes that goodwill is not impaired.  
 Restructuring, Integration and Other Expenses  
 Comparatively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, restructuring, integration and other expenses were $25.1 million. The after tax impact of restructuring, integration, and other expenses was $19.4 million and $0.16 per share on a diluted basis.

 Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $153.1 million, an increase of $211.6 million, or 361.7%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2018 operating loss of $58.5 million. The year over year increase in operating income was primarily driven by the reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses and no goodwill impairment expense as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by the decline in sales and gross profit margin. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $178.1 million, an increase of $7.3 million, or 4.3%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The year over year increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year third quarter, partially offset by the decline in sales and gross profit margin.  
 Operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was $396.0 million, or 2.7% of consolidated sales, as compared with operating income of $87.7 million, or 0.6% of consolidated sales in the first nine months of 2018.

 Financing Transactions  
 See Note 5, “Debt” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on financing transactions including the Credit Facility, the Securitization Program, and other outstanding debt as of March 30, 2019. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program as of March 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.  
 The Company has various lines of credit, financing arrangements and other forms of bank debt in the U.S. and various foreign locations to fund the short-term working capital, foreign exchange, overdraft and letter of credit needs of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Outstanding borrowings under such forms of debt at the end of third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.8 million.  
 As an alternative form of financing outside of the United States, the Company sells certain of its trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements. The Company accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables are recorded within “Interest and other financing expenses, net” and were not material.  
 Liquidity  
 The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $725.3 million as of March 30, 2019, of which $660.7 million was held outside the United States. As of June 30, 2018, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $621.1 million, of which $545.3 million was held outside of the United States.

Availability under the Securitization Program is subject to the Company having sufficient eligible trade accounts receivable to support desired borrowings. The Company currently expects to utilize availability under credit facilities to support working capital and other general corporate purposes to the extent such incremental borrowings do not impact the Company’s investment grade credit rating. During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $29.8 million and $71.2 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility and approximately $456.0 million and $259.0 million, respectively, under the Securitization Program.

Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth. The Company generated $492.0 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended March 30, 2019 from continuing operations.
