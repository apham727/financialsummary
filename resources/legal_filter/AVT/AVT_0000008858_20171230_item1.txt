 1. Basis of presentation and new accounting pronouncements  
 In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly Avnet, Inc.’s and its consolidated subsidiaries’ (collectively, the “Company” or “Avnet”) financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  
 Certain reclassifications have been made in prior periods and the fiscal year to date current periods to conform to the current period presentation.  
 In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”), which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the qualification and application of the hedge accounting compared to current GAAP. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-12 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (“ASU 2017-07”). The new guidance requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be presented in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, and allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization in assets. Other components of the net periodic benefit cost are to be presented separately from the line item that includes the service cost and outside of any subtotal of operating income, and the line item must be appropriately described. If a separate line item is not used, the line item used in the income statement to present the other components of net benefit cost must be disclosed. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that annual period, with early adoption permitted. The amendment is to be applied retrospectively. The new guidance primarily impacts the income statement 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”). The update requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The update will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended (“ASU 2014-09”), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principles of ASU 2014-09 are to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Application of the guidance in ASU 2014-09 is expected to require more judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process compared to existing GAAP. ASU 2014-09 is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.   
 The Company expects to adopt the requirements of ASU 2014-09 using retrospective adoption to each prior reporting period presented. The company has established an implementation team inclusive of external advisors engaged to assist in evaluating potential differences compared to existing GAAP. The Company has identified its revenue streams and is currently assessing each stream for potential impacts from the adoption of ASU 2014-09. For the revenue streams assessed, the Company does not anticipate a material impact in the timing or amount of revenue recognized.   
 On October 17, 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Premier Farnell Plc (“PF”), a global distributor of electronic components and related products. The cash consideration paid for the acquisition was approximately $841 million, which consisted of £1.85 per share of PF common stock. Additionally, Avnet assumed $242.8 million of debt at fair value.   
 The PF acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The purchase price of this acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the transaction date.   
 Approximately $10.0 million of goodwill associated with the PF acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.  
 In August 2017, the Company acquired Dragon Innovation, Inc. (“Dragon”), a provider of manufacturing logistics services to entrepreneurs. The impact of this acquisition was not material to the Company’s consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations.  
 3. Discontinued operations and gain on sale  
 In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Technology Solutions (“TS”) business to Tech Data Corporation (the “Buyer”). Included in the gain on sale recorded upon completion of the sale were estimates for certain income taxes due on the gain and additional cash consideration expected from the Buyer related to a closing date net working capital sales price adjustment (the “closing date adjustment”). The Company is finalizing the closing date adjustment with the Buyer as provided for in the sales agreement and has included an estimate of this amount as the principal component of the $269.2 million of prepaid and other current assets as of December 30, 2017. The final closing date adjustment, as determined through the established process outlined in the sales agreement, may be materially different from the Company’s estimate. The impact of any probable changes in the closing date adjustment will be recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale from discontinued operations in the period such change occurs. Additionally, the income taxes associated with the gain will be impacted by the final geographic allocation of the sales price, which must be agreed to with the Buyer after determination of the closing date adjustment as required in the sales agreement and may be materially different from the Company’s estimates. The impact of any changes in estimated income taxes on the gain will be recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale from discontinued operations in the period such change in estimate occurs. The Company expects the closing date adjustment to be finalized by the end of fiscal 2018 and the income tax on the gain to be finalized during fiscal 2019.  
 The Company received 2.8 million shares of the Buyer’s common stock at closing (the “Shares”), which has been recorded within “Marketable securities” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized and realized gains or losses due to changes in fair value based upon Level 1 quoted active market prices of the Shares are recorded in “Other income (expense), net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The sales agreement includes time based contractual restrictions related to the Company’s sale of the Shares and as such, the Company entered into economic hedges to reduce the Company’s exposure to price fluctuations of the Shares during the restricted period, which fixes the net amount that the Company will realize upon the sale of the Shares. The Company records changes in fair value related to the economic share price hedges within “Other income (expense), net”, offsetting the changes in fair value of the underlying Shares. During the six months ended December 30, 2017, the Company sold 1.4 million Shares, the net proceeds of which have been included in “Cash flows from investing activities – discontinued operations.”  
 In connection with the sale of the TS business, the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”), pursuant to which the Buyer will pay the Company to provide certain information technology, distribution, facilities, finance and human resources related services for various periods of time depending upon the services not to exceed approximately two years from the closing date. Expenses incurred by the Company to provide such services under the TSA are classified within selling, general and administrative expenses and amounts billed to the Buyer to provide such services are classified as a reduction of such expenses. The Buyer has terminated substantially all TSA services outside of certain information technology services and all remaining TSA services are expected to be terminated by the end of fiscal 2018.  
 Included within selling, general and administrative expenses of discontinued operations was $14.1 million and $26.6 million of estimated corporate expenses, excluding general overhead, specific to or benefiting the TS business for the second quarter and six months ended December 31, 2016.   
 The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 substantially all relates to settlement losses associated with the Company’s pension plan due to former TS business employees requesting and receiving distributions from the Company’s pension plan during fiscal 2018. Refer to Note 9, “Pension plan,” for further information on the pension settlement losses.  
 The following table presents the change in goodwill by reportable segment for the six months ended December 30, 2017. All of the accumulated impairment was recognized in fiscal 2009.  
 The Company’s reporting units passed goodwill impairment testing using a quantitative impairment model in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, however, the Company’s Electronic Components (“EC”) Americas reporting units had an estimated fair value that was not substantially in excess of its carrying value. The Company also evaluates each quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, which would require the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. Indicators that the Company evaluates to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary include, but are not limited to (i) a sustained decrease in share price or market capitalization, (ii) changes in the macroeconomic or industry environments, (iii) the results of and the amount of time passed since the last goodwill impairment test and (iv) the long-term expected financial performance of its reporting units.  
 The following table presents the Company’s acquired intangible assets at December 30, 2017, and July 1, 2017, respectively.   
 Bank credit facilities and other consists primarily of various committed and uncommitted lines of credit and other forms of bank debt with financial institutions utilized primarily to support the working capital requirements of the Company including its foreign operations.  
 The Company has an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Program”) in the United States with a group of financial institutions to allow the Company to transfer, on an ongoing revolving basis, an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable, to provide security or collateral for borrowings up to a maximum of $400 million. The Program does not qualify for off balance sheet accounting treatment and any borrowings under the Program are recorded as debt in the consolidated balance sheets. Under the Program, the Company legally sells and isolates certain U.S. trade accounts receivable into a wholly owned and consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Such receivables, which are recorded within “Receivables” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $730.8 million and $807.5 million at December 30, 2017, and July 1, 2017, respectively. The Program contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold. The Program also requires the Company to maintain certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios, which the Company was in compliance with as of December 30, 2017, and July 1, 2017. The Program expires in August 2018 and as a result the Company has classified outstanding balances as short-term debt as of December 30, 2017. Interest on borrowings is calculated using a base rate or a commercial paper rate plus a spread of 0.40% with a facility fee of 0.40%.  
 As of December 30, 2017, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.73 billion and $1.80 billion, respectively. At July 1, 2017, the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s total debt was $1.78 billion and $1.85 billion, respectively. Fair value for the notes was estimated based upon quoted market prices and for other forms of debt fair value approximates carrying value due to the market based variable nature of the interest rates on those debt agreements.  
 Many of the Company’s subsidiaries purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies. This subjects the Company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging (e.g., offsetting receivables and payables in the same foreign currency) as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward foreign exchange contracts typically with maturities of less than 60 days (“economic hedges”), but no longer than one year. The Company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not economically hedged. The Company adjusts any economic hedges to fair value through the consolidated statements of operations primarily within “other income (expense), net.” The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, which are based upon Level 2 criteria under the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy, are classified in the captions “other current assets” or “accrued expenses and other,” as applicable, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 30, 2017, and July 1, 2017. The Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with various financial institutions related to derivative financial instruments allow for the right of offset. The Company’s policy is to present derivative financial instruments with the same counterparty as either a net asset or liability when the right of offset exists.  
 In addition to amounts included in the above table, there was approximately $12.8 million and $34.0 million as of December 30, 2017 and July 1, 2017, respectively, of accrued expenses related to derivative financial instruments used to economically hedge the fair value changes in marketable securities discussed further in Note 3.  
 The above table excludes approximately $27.0 million and $35.0 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017, respectively, of derivative financial instrument losses in other income (expenses), net, associated with foreign currency derivative financial instruments purchased to economically hedge the British Pound purchase price of the PF acquisition.  
 7. Commitments and contingencies  
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company’s effective tax rate of 46.7% was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) net increases to valuation allowances against deferred tax assets created primarily from acquisition related expenses that were deemed unrealizable and (ii) the impact of non-deductible acquisition related expenses, partially offset by (iii) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.  
 During the first six months of fiscal 2017, the Company’s effective tax rate of 33.0% was unfavorably impacted primarily by (i) net increases to valuation allowances against deferred tax assets that were deemed unrealizable and (ii) the impact of non-deductible acquisition related expenses, partially offset by (iii) the mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.   
 The Company contributed $8.0 million to the Plans during the first six months of fiscal 2018 and expects to make an additional contribution to the Plans of $8.0 million in the remainder of fiscal 2018.  
 The Plans meet the definition of defined benefit plans and as a result, the Company applies ASC 715 pension accounting to the Plans. The Plans, however, are cash balance plans that are similar in nature to defined contribution plans in that a participant’s benefit is defined in terms of stated account balances. The cash balance plans provides the Company with the benefit of applying any earnings on the Plan’s investments beyond the fixed return provided to participants, toward the Company’s future cash funding obligations.  
 Amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, to operating expenses during the second quarters and the first six months of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were not material and substantially all related to net periodic pension costs including recognition of actuarial losses and amortization of prior service credits.  
 In connection with the sale of the TS business, a significant number of former employees became terminated vested employees under the Plan. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the aggregate amount of former employee withdrawals from the Plan exceeded the pension accounting threshold for fiscal 2018, which required a settlement charge under ASC 715 pension accounting. As a result, the Company recognized a $14.0 million pension settlement charge before taxes in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 classified within loss from discontinued operations.  
 In November 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $200 million increase in the Company’s existing share repurchase program. With this increase, the Company may repurchase up to $1.95 billion of common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors such as share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and prevailing market conditions. During the second quarter and six months ended December 30, 2017, the Company repurchased 1.7 million and 3.6 million shares, respectively, under this program for a total cost of $67.4 million and $139.4 million, respectively. As of December 30, 2017, the Company had $459.6 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.  
 In November 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.18 per common share and dividend payments of $21.6 million were made in December 2017. During the six months ended December 31, 2017, the Company paid dividends of $0.36 per common share and $43.6 million in total.

 Pursuant to SEC regulations, including but not limited to Item 103 of Regulation S-K, the Company regularly assesses the status of and developments in pending environmental and other compliance related legal proceedings to determine whether any such proceedings should be identified specifically in this discussion of legal proceedings, and has concluded that no particular pending legal proceeding requires public disclosure. Based on the information known to date, management believes that the Company has appropriately accrued in its consolidated financial statements for its share of the estimable costs of environmental and other compliance related matters.
