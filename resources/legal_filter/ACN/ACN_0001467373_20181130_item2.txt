We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2019” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2019. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. 
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. 
•Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. 
•Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
•As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks.
•Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. 
•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. 
•If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
•Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. 
•We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. 
•We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. 
•Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders. 
Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. 
Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). In connection with the adoption, we present total revenues and no longer report revenues before reimbursements (net revenues). This change has no impact on operating income but does affect ratios calculated as a percentage of revenue, such as operating margin. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 2% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2019, we estimate that our full fiscal 2019 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), which required us to reclassify certain components of pension costs from operating expenses to non-operating expenses. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 31.1%, compared with 31.0% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 15.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared with 15.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues were flat, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 10 basis points.

The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 19.8%, compared with 20.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2018 was primarily due to higher benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes partially offset by the impact of adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.96 for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared with $1.79 for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The $0.17 increase in our diluted earnings per share was due to an increase of $0.16 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.02 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.02 from higher non-operating expense. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. 
We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. 
Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. 
The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. 
In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. 
To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 
See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) and Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Note 2 includes updates to our revenue policy as result of the implementation of FASB ASU No. 2014-09.
