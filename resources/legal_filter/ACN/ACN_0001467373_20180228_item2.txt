We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2018” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2018. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.
We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.
Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
•Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.
•Our global delivery capability is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
•If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
•Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders.
Overview
Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. 
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2017, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 6% and 4% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we estimate that our full fiscal 2018 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 4.0% higher in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency.
Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 29.7%, compared with 30.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2018 was 30.9%, compared with 31.1% for the six months ended February 28, 2017. The decrease in gross margin for three and six months ended February 28, 2018 was principally due to lower consulting contract profitability as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and 16.4% for the six months ended February 28, 2018, compared with 16.4% for both the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and six months ended February 28, 2017. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2017, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 10 basis points and were flat, respectively, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were flat and decreased 10 basis points, respectively.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.33 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $3.16 for the six months ended February 28, 2018, compared with $2.91 for the six months ended February 28, 2017. The $137 million charge associated with the Tax Act decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.21 in both the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and six months ended February 28, 2018. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.58 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and $3.37 for the six months ended February 28, 2018.

•Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.
Other Income (Expense), net 
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies. For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, other expense increased $31 million over the second quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses. 
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $7 million, or 15%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Earnings Per Share
Diluted earnings per share were $1.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $1.33 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The $0.04 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $137 million charge associated with the Tax Act, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.21. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $0.25 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2017, due to increases of $0.17 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.10 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from higher non-operating expense and $0.01 from higher net income attributable to other non-controlling interests. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.”

Other Income (Expense), net 
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies. For the six months ended February 28, 2018, other expense increased $23 million over the six months ended February 28, 2017, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses. 
The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2018 was 23.0%, compared with 20.5% for the six months ended February 28, 2017. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million charge associated with the enactment of the Tax Act. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2018 would have been 18.0%. The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2018 benefited from lower expenses for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower benefits from final determinations of prior year U.S. taxes in fiscal 2018. For additional information see Note 8 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.
Act, we expect the fiscal 2018 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year.

Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the six months ended February 28, 2018 increased $0.46 compared with the six months ended February 28, 2017, due to increases of $0.36 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.10 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.03 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $0.02 from higher net income attributable to other non-controlling interests and $0.01 from higher non-operating expenses.

Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. 
Borrowing Facilities
Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $246 million of letters of credit outstanding as of February 28, 2018. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into agreements that will allow us to establish a commercial paper program for short-term borrowings of up to $1 billion, backed by our syndicated loan facility.  
The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares, Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.
Other Share Redemptions
During the six months ended February 28, 2018, we issued 351,804 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the “registration statement”). The registration statement allowed us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. In connection with the merger of Accenture Holdings plc with and into Accenture plc, we have terminated the registration statement.

Purchases and Redemptions of Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares and Class X Ordinary Shares
The following table provides information relating to our purchases of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and redemptions of Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. In connection with the merger of Accenture Holdings plc with and into Accenture plc on March 13, 2018, the Accenture plc Class X ordinary shares held by Accenture Holdings plc shareholders were redeemed. For additional information, see Note 11 (Subsequent Event) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.
Purchases and Redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc Ordinary Shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares
The following table provides additional information relating to our purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We believe that the following table and footnotes provide useful information regarding the share purchase and redemption activity of Accenture. Generally, purchases and redemptions of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for cash and employee forfeitures reduce shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share. However, in connection with the merger of Accenture Holdings plc with and into Accenture plc on March 13, 2018, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture plc and Accenture Holdings plc) received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned. Accordingly, as of March 13, 2018, there were no longer any ordinary shares of Accenture Holdings plc outstanding. For additional information, see Note 11 (Subsequent Event) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”.
