In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. 
For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholdersâ€™ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017 as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 3 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Other Derivatives
Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $84,480 and $37,698 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, and a net gain of $89,035 and a net loss of $29,279 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. 
Fair Value of Derivative Instruments
In May 2017, we settled our U.S. pension plan obligations. Plan participants elected to receive either a lump-sum distribution or to transfer benefits to a third-party annuity provider. As a result of the settlement, we were relieved of any further obligation under our U.S. pension plan. During the three months ended May 31, 2017, we recorded a pension settlement charge of $509,793, and related income tax benefits of $198,219. The charge primarily consisted of unrecognized actuarial losses of $460,908 previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. In connection with the settlement, we made a $118,500 cash contribution ($48,885 related to additional actuarial losses and $69,615 to fund previously recorded pension liabilities).
Indemnifications and Guarantees
In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters.
