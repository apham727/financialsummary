Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02 and related updates (“Topic 842”) 
On September 1, 2019, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, and related updates (“Topic 842”) using the effective date method. Prior period amounts were not adjusted. The primary impact of adoption is the requirement for lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by both operating and finance leases. Enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements are also required. We elected the package of practical expedients which does not require reassessment of prior conclusions related to identifying leases, lease classification or initial direct costs. We also elected the practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components, accounting for the combined components as a single lease component, for our office real estate and automobile leases. The standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Income Statement.
See Note 7 (Leases) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. 
Disaggregation of Revenue 
Remaining Performance Obligations 
Contract Estimates 
Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Deferred transition revenues were $583,531 and $563,245 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were $691,727 and $681,492 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs.
Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2019 that were included in Deferred revenues as of August 31, 2019 were $1.8 billion. Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2018 that were included in Deferred revenues as of September 1, 2018 were $1.8 billion. 
Goodwill includes immaterial adjustments related to prior period acquisitions.
Intangible Assets 
We account for leases in accordance with Topic 842. See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our adoption. 
Lease assets and liabilities recognized at the lease commencement date are determined predominantly as the present value of the payments due over the lease term. Unless the implicit rate can be determined, we use our incremental borrowing rate on that date to calculate the present value. Our incremental borrowing rate approximates the rate at which we could borrow, on a secured basis for a similar term, an amount equal to our lease payments in a similar economic environment. 
Effective September 1, 2019, when we are the lessee, all leases are recognized as lease liabilities and associated lease assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make payments arising from the lease. Lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and may also include advance payments, initial direct costs or lease incentives. Fixed and variable payments that depend upon an index or rate, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are included in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities at the commencement-date rate. Other variable payments, such as common area maintenance, property and other taxes, utilities and insurance that are based on the lessor’s cost, are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period incurred. 
As of November 30, 2019, our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.4 years and a weighted average discount rate of 4.2%. 
As of November 30, 2019, we have entered into operating leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $430 million that are not reflected in the table above. These leases are primarily related to office real estate and will commence in or before fiscal year 2022 with lease terms of up to 17 years. 
Dividends 
The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.
Subsequent Event 
On December 16, 2019, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share on its Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on January 16, 2020 payable on February 14, 2020. The payment of the cash dividend will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.
In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. 
For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.
