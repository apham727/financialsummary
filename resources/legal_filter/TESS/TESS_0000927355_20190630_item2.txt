 Business Overview and Environment  
 TESSCO architects and delivers innovative product and value chain solutions to support wireless broadband systems. Although we sell products to customers in many countries, approximately 97% of our sales are made to customers in the United States. We have operations and office facilities in Hunt Valley, Maryland, Reno, Nevada and San Antonio, Texas.   
 Our first quarter fiscal 2020 revenue decreased by 13.4% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. First quarter fiscal 2020 revenue in the commercial segment and retail segment decreased 6.8% and 28.8%, respectively, as compared to the first fiscal quarter of 2019. The decline in our commercial segment revenue was driven by a decrease in our public carrier market due to the project-oriented nature of this business. Several large customers either adjusted their forecasts or pushed out their product requirements from the first fiscal quarter into the remainder of the year. For the retail segment, revenue decreased due to significantly lower revenues from one of our more significant retail customers following its recent acquisition, change in business model and subsequent transition of its business elsewhere, as well as ongoing overall market softness. Among our product categories, revenue decreased in our base station infrastructure, network systems, installation, test and maintenance, and mobile device accessories categories by 7.1%, 1.0%, 18.9% and 28.7%, respectively, for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to the same quarter last year.   
 Our first quarter fiscal year 2020 gross profit decreased by 17.7%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of the decrease in revenue discussed above. Gross

margin for the first quarter fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2019 was 19.3% and 20.3%, respectively. The decline in gross margin was a result of the impact of tariffs and inventory write-offs. Selling, General and Administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 were down 3.0% compared to the first quarter fiscal year 2019. The decrease is related to decreased compensation, benefits, and rewards expense. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in occupancy expense and distribution support expense. The Company also incurred a restructuring charge related to severance expenses. As a result, net income decreased by $3.7 million or 315.2% and diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.42 or 323.1% compared to the prior-year quarter.

 The Company also incurred a $0.5 million restructuring charge related to severance expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2020.

 Interest, Net. Net interest expense increased from $174,400 for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to $208,700 for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Increased focus on business opportunities for sales to our public carrier customers has required us to maintain increased inventory levels, and at times has resulted in increased borrowings and interest expense under our secured Revolving Credit Facility (discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). We expect this higher level of interest expense to continue for at least the next several quarters.   
 Income Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share. The effective tax rate increased from 25.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to 29.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate is the result of permanent and other tax adjustments remaining consistent year over year while pre-tax income decreased year over year. Tax benefits were fully recognized in fiscal 2019. Net income decreased 315.2% and diluted earnings per share decreased 323.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the corresponding prior-year quarter.   
 The following table summarizes our cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018.  
 We used $2.0 million of net cash from operating activities for the first three months of fiscal 2020, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $1.7 million for the first three months of fiscal 2019. This fiscal 2020 outflow was driven by a net loss and an increase in inventory, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in accounts receivable. Both current and potential opportunities within our public carrier business caused a significant investment in inventory. Accounts payable also increased in response to higher inventory levels.   
 Net cash used in investing activities of $1.9 million for the first three months of fiscal 2020 increased from cash used of $1.4 million for the first three months of fiscal 2019. Cash used in both periods was due to capital expenditures largely comprised of investments in information technology.   
 Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 million for the first three months of fiscal 2020, compared to $3.1 million provided in the first three months of fiscal 2019. We utilized our asset based secured Revolving Credit Facility during the first three months of fiscal 2020 and 2019, leading to a cash inflow of $5.7 million and $4.9 million, respectively, during those periods. During the first three months of both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, we had cash outflows of $1.7 million, due to cash dividends paid to shareholders.

other things, an increase the Company’s borrowing limit from up to $35 million to up to $75 million. In addition to expanding the borrowing limit, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement extended the applicable maturity date to October 19, 2021. As of June 30, 2019, borrowings under the secured Revolving Credit Facility totaled $20.1 million; therefore, we then had $54.9 million available, subject to the Borrowing Base limitations and compliance with the other applicable terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the financial and other covenants discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement accrue interest at the rates, and the Company is required to pay a monthly commitment fee, as also discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
 We have made quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock since the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Our most recent quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share was paid in June 2019. On July 16, 2019, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.20 per share, payable on August 21, 2019 to shareholders of record as of August 7, 2019.   
 Any future declaration of dividends and the establishment of any corresponding record and payment dates remains subject to further determination from time to time by the Board of Directors.
