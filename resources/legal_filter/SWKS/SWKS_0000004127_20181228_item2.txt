In this document, the words “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer only to Skyworks Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries and not any other person or entity.
We, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, are empowering the wireless networking revolution. Our analog semiconductors are connecting people, places, and things spanning a number of new applications within the aerospace, automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, tablet and wearable markets.
We generated net revenue of $972.0 million for the three months ended December 28, 2018, a decrease of $79.9 million or 7.6%, as compared with $1,051.9 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 2018. This decrease in net revenue is primarily related to weakness in smartphone demand, partially offset by increasing RF content per smartphone. 
The $51.7 million decrease in gross profit for the three months ended December 28, 2018, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, was primarily the result of lower average selling prices and lower unit volumes with a gross profit impact of $170.5 million. These negative impacts were partially offset by favorable product mix that positively impacted gross profit by $119.8 million. Gross profit margin decreased to 49.9% of net revenue for the three months ended December 28, 2018, as compared with 51.0% in the corresponding period in fiscal 2018.
The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended December 28, 2018, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, was primarily related to an increase in employee-related compensation expense and product development–related expenses. Research and development expense increased as a percentage of net revenue as a result of our increased investment in developing new technologies and products. 
The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 28, 2018, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2018, was primarily related to a decrease in share-based compensation expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses remained consistent as a percentage of net revenue.
During the three months ended December 28, 2018, $8.1 million and $7.4 million in amortization of intangibles were included in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expense, respectively. During the three months ended December 29, 2017, $4.0 million in amortization of intangibles was included in selling, general and administrative expense.
Cash provided by operating activities consists of net income for the period adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain operating assets and liabilities. During the three months ended December 28, 2018, we generated $549.0 million of cash from operating activities, an increase of $188.2 million as compared with the $360.8 million generated during the three months ended December 29, 2017. The increase in cash from operating activities during the three months ended December 28, 2018, was primarily related to an increase in cash generated from collecting receivables and reduced payments of payables totaling $218.7 million. 
Cash provided by investing activities consists of cash received related to the sale or maturity of marketable securities, partially offset by cash paid for capital expenditures and cash paid related to the purchase of marketable securities. Cash provided by investing activities was $171.5 million during the three months ended December 28, 2018, as compared with $34.2 million cash used in investing activities during the three months ended December 29, 2017. Purchases of marketable securities were $2.2 million and sales and maturities of marketable securities were $303.2 million during the three months ended December 28, 2018. The cash used for capital expenditures was $129.5 million in the three months ended December 28, 2018, primarily related to the purchase of manufacturing equipment to support the expansion of our assembly and test operations, filter production operations, and wafer fabrication facilities. 
•$67.1 million related to the payment of cash dividends on our common stock; and
•$19.4 million related to the minimum statutory payroll tax withholdings upon vesting of employee performance and restricted stock awards.
These uses of cash were partially offset by the net proceeds from employee stock option exercises of $2.4 million during the three months ended December 28, 2018.
Cash and cash equivalent balances were $1,085.7 million as of December 28, 2018, representing an increase of $352.4 million from September 28, 2018. The increase resulted from $549.0 million in cash generated from operations and $301.0 million in net sales and maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by $284.0 million used to repurchase 4.0 million shares of stock, $67.1 million in cash dividend payments, $19.4 million used to repurchase shares related to payroll tax withholdings on equity awards, and $129.5 million in capital expenditures. Based on our historical results of operations, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, working capital, quarterly cash dividend payments (if such dividends are declared by the Board of Directors), outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with existing operations for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot be certain that our cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be available in the future to fund all of our capital and operating requirements. In addition, any future strategic investments and acquisitions may require additional cash and capital resources. If we are unable to obtain sufficient cash or capital to meet our needs on a timely basis and on favorable terms, our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected.
Our contractual obligations disclosure in the 2018 10-K has not materially changed since we filed that report.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
On November 15, 2017, we agreed to potentially issue not more than 1% of our common stock to an unaffiliated third party as contingent consideration for its role under a multi-year collaboration agreement. The shares are issuable for no cash payment but only upon the achievement of certain product sale milestones, certain terminations of the agreement or if the Company engages in 
certain competition with the third party. Though the timing is not certain, the Company does not expect achievement of the product sale milestones to occur any time prior to mid-2020. The transaction was made in reliance on the exemption from registration in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Company has agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering the resale of any issued shares.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
