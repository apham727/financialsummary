OVERVIEW



We, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, are empowering the wireless networking revolution.
Our highly innovative analog semiconductors are connecting people, places, and things spanning a number of new and previously unimagined applications within the automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, tablet and wearable markets.
We generally experience seasonal peaks during the second half of the calendar year, primarily as a result of increased worldwide production of consumer electronics in anticipation of increased holiday sales, whereas our second fiscal quarter is typically lower and in line with seasonal industry trends.
We generated net revenue of $894.3 million for the three months ended June 29, 2018, a decrease of $6.5 million or 0.7%, as compared with $900.8 million for the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017.
Net revenue increased by 7.2% or $192.8 million to $2,859.6 million for the nine months ended June 29, 2018, as compared with $2,666.8 million for the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017.
GROSS PROFIT



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Gross profit represents net revenue less cost of goods sold.
Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials, labor and overhead (including depreciation and share-based compensation expense) associated with product manufacturing.
Erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the semiconductor industry.
The $2.0 million decrease in gross profit for the three months ended June 29, 2018, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017, was primarily the result of lower average selling prices and lower unit volumes with a gross profit impact of $52.8 million.
Gross profit margin increased to 50.5% of net revenue for the three months ended June 29, 2018, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017.
The $104.2 million increase in gross profit for the nine months ended June 29, 2018, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017, was primarily the result of favorable product mix, lower per-unit materials and manufacturing costs and higher unit volumes that positively impacted gross profit by $227.0 million.
Gross profit margin increased to 50.6% of net revenue for the nine months ended June 29, 2018, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017.
The increase in research and development expenses for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2018, as compared with the corresponding periods in fiscal year 2017, was primarily related to an increase in employee-related compensation expense and product development–related expenses.
Research and development expense increased as a percentage of net revenue, when compared with the corresponding periods in fiscal year 2017, as a result of our increased investment in developing new technologies and products.
The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 29, 2018, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017, was primarily related to a net gain related to the fair value adjustment of contingent consideration during the period.
The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended June 29, 2018, as compared with the corresponding periods in fiscal year 2017, was primarily related to increases in employee-related compensation and share-based compensation during the period.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 29, 2018, decreased as a percentage of net revenue, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017, due to the aforementioned decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended June 29, 2018, decreased as a percentage of net revenue, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2017, due to the aforementioned increase in net revenue.
AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



 17

The decrease in amortization expense for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2018, as compared with the corresponding periods in fiscal year 2017, was primarily due to the end of the useful lives of certain intangible assets that were acquired in prior fiscal years.
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



We recorded a provision for income taxes of $24.3 million (which consisted of $16.0 million and $8.3 million related to United States and foreign income taxes, respectively) and $355.8 million (which consisted of $328.7 million and $27.1 million related to United States and foreign income taxes, respectively) for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2018, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended June 29, 2018, was 7.8% and 36.0%, respectively, as compared with 19.7% and 19.8% for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.
The difference between our effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 29, 2018, of 36.0% and the federal statutory rate of 24.6% resulted primarily from a one-time charge of $238.0 million related to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings, a one-time charge of $18.5 million related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to tax reform, and an increase in tax expense related to a change in the reserve for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate, the domestic production activities deduction, research and experimentation tax credits earned, a decrease to tax expense of $12.0 million related to the release of tax reserves due to the lapse of statute of limitations and a benefit of $23.6 million related to windfall stock deductions.
See Note 7 for a detailed discussion of the impact of the new U.S. tax legislation, including an adjustment made in the nine months ended June 29, 2018, to our provisional estimate related to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Cash flow provided by operating activities:



Cash provided by operating activities consists of net income for the period adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain operating assets and liabilities.
During the nine months ended June 29, 2018, we generated $1,053.0 million of cash from operating activities, an increase of $14.3 million as compared with the $1,038.7 million generated during the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
The increase in cash from operating activities during the nine months ended June 29, 2018, was primarily related to an increase in net income, exclusive of the unpaid portion of the mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings.
Cash flow used in investing activities:



Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid related to the purchase of marketable securities, offset by cash received related to the sale or maturity of marketable securities.
Cash used in investing activities was $809.2 million during the nine months ended June 29, 2018, as compared with $228.5 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
Purchases of marketable securities were $523.2 million and sales and maturities of marketable securities were $32.6 million during the nine months ended June 29, 2018.
The cash used for capital expenditures was $310.0 million in the nine months ended June 29, 2018, primarily related to the purchase of manufacturing equipment to support the expansion of our assembly and test operations, filter production operations, and wafer fabrication facilities.
During the nine months ended June 29, 2018, we also paid $8.6 million related to purchased intangibles.
18

Cash flow used in financing activities:



Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of cash transactions related to equity.
During the nine months ended June 29, 2018, we had net cash outflows from financing activities of $702.5 million, as compared with net cash outflows from financing activities of $450.0 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2017.
During the nine months ended June 29, 2018, we had the following significant uses of cash:



•$524.5 million related to our repurchase of 5.1 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors on January 31, 2018, and January 19, 2017; 



•$175.2 million related to the payment of cash dividends on our common stock; and



•$47.5 million related to the minimum statutory payroll tax withholdings payments on the vesting of employee performance and restricted stock awards.
These uses of cash were partially offset by the net proceeds from employee stock option exercises of $34.8 million during the nine months ended June 29, 2018.
Liquidity:



Cash and cash equivalent balances were $1,158.1 million as of June 29, 2018, representing a decrease of $458.7 million from September 29, 2017.
The decrease resulted from $524.5 million used to repurchase 5.1 million shares of stock, $175.2 million in cash dividend payments, $47.5 million used to repurchase shares related to payroll tax withholdings on equity awards, $490.6 million in net purchases of marketable securities and $310.0 million in capital expenditures which was partially offset by $1,053.0 million in cash generated from operations.
Based on our historical results of operations, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, working capital, quarterly cash dividend payments (if such dividends are declared by the Board of Directors), outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with existing operations for at least the next 12 months.
However, we cannot be certain that our cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be available in the future to fund all of our capital and operating requirements.
Our invested cash balances primarily consist of highly liquid term deposits and money market funds where the underlying securities primarily consist of United States treasury obligations, United States agency obligations and repurchase agreements collateralized by United States government and agency obligations.
We had $1,158.1 million of total cash and cash equivalents as of June 29, 2018, including $492.2 million held overseas.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS



Our contractual obligations disclosure in the 2017 10-K has not materially changed since we filed that report, except for the $238.0 million deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings, which is payable over the next eight years, $19.0 million per year for each of the next five years, followed by payments of $35.8 million, $47.7 million, and $59.5 million in years six through eight, respectively.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in SEC Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4)(ii).
