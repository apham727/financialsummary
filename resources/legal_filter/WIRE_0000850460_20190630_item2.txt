Item 2.
Encore believes it is a low-cost manufacturer of electrical building wire and cable.
The Company is a significant supplier of building wire for interior electrical wiring in commercial and industrial buildings, homes, apartments, and manufactured housing.
Price competition for electrical wire and cable is intense, and the Company sells its products in accordance with prevailing market prices.
Copper, a commodity product, is the principal raw material used by the Company in manufacturing its products.
Copper accounted for approximately 73.0%, 69.7%, and 65.2% of the Company’s cost of goods sold during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Additionally, the SEC allows shares of certain physically backed copper exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) to be listed and publicly traded.
Such funds and other copper ETFs like them hold copper cathode as collateral against their shares.
The acquisition of copper cathode by copper ETFs may materially decrease or interrupt the availability of copper for immediate delivery in the United States, which could materially increase the Company’s cost of copper.
In addition to rising copper prices and potential supply shortages, we believe that ETFs and similar copper-backed derivative products could lead to increased price volatility for copper.
Wire prices can, and frequently do, change on a daily basis.
Historically, the Company has not engaged in hedging strategies for raw material purchases.
The tables below highlight the range of closing prices of copper on a per pound basis on the Comex exchange for the periods shown.
Reference should also be made to the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Results of Operations



Quarter Ended June 30, 2019 Compared to Quarter Ended June 30, 2018 



Net sales were $336.9 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $336.8 million in the second quarter of 2018.
The virtually identical net sales dollars are primarily the result of a 5.6% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, offset by a 6.1% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period.
The 5.6% increase in unit volume shipped was primarily due to strong construction industry demand despite rough spring weather in certain areas that slowed construction and impacted volumes in the second quarter of 2019.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 8.7% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold was $291.0 million, or 86.4% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $292.3 million, or 86.8% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018.
Gross profit increased to $45.9 million, or 13.6% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2019 from $44.5 million, or 13.2% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018.
The small increase in gross profit margin percentage was primarily the result of two factors that served to mostly offset each other.
Unit volumes increased 5.6%, while the spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sales price for a pound of copper contained in finished wire decreased 0.4% in the second quarter of 2019 versus the second quarter of 2018.
The spread decreased as a result of the average sales price per pound of copper sold decreasing 6.1% while the per pound cost of raw copper purchased decreased 8.7%.
The percentage change on sales is on a higher nominal dollar amount than on purchases and, therefore, spreads change on a nominal dollar basis.
The margin changes were due primarily to the competitive pricing environment in the industry.
On May 30, 2019, the U.S. Commerce Department imposed a preliminary antidumping ruling on imports of aluminum wire from China at rates ranging from 58.36 to 63.32 percent.
The final results of the U.S. Government’s ongoing antidumping and countervailing duty investigations are not expected until the end of the year.
Total raw materials cost, including the LIFO adjustment, decreased to 74.6% of net sales in the second quarter of 2019, from 76.4% of net sales in the second quarter of 2018.
Overheads contain some fixed and semi-fixed components which do not fluctuate as much as sales dollars fluctuate.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first out (LIFO) method, or market.
The Company maintains two inventory pools for LIFO purposes.
As permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis and makes a monthly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO.
The Company performs a lower of cost or market calculation quarterly.
As of June 30, 2019, no LCM adjustment was required.
However, decreases

in copper and other material prices could necessitate establishing an LCM reserve in future periods.
During the second quarter of 2018, a LIFO adjustment was recorded, increasing cost of sales by $1.7 million.
Selling expenses, consisting of commissions and freight, for the second quarter of 2019 were $17.3 million, or 5.1% of net sales, compared to $17.3 million, or 5.1% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018.
Freight costs decreased to 2.6% of net sales in the second quarter of 2019 from 2.7% of net sales in the second quarter of 2018.
General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $6.5 million, or 1.9% of net sales, compared to $4.2 million, or 1.2% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2018.
The G&A increase was driven primarily by increased stock compensation expense, driven primarily by our strong stock price performance driving the mark to market accounting on stock appreciation rights.
The net stock compensation expense increased $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2019 versus the second quarter of 2018.
The Company did not record any bad debt expense during the second quarters of 2019 or 2018.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2018



Net sales for the first six months of 2019 were $651.6 million compared to net sales of $628.2 million for the first six months of 2018.
This 3.7% increase in net sales is primarily the result of a 2.8% increase in copper wire sales, driven by a 9.3% increase in copper wire unit volume shipped, partially offset by a 5.9% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire.
Unit volume is measured in pounds of copper contained in the wire shipped during the period.
The average cost per pound of raw copper purchased decreased 9.1% in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 and was the principal driver of the decreased average sales price of copper wire.
Cost of goods sold increased to $564.3 million in the first six months of 2019, compared to $546.2 million in the first six months of 2018.
Gross profit increased to $87.2 million, or 13.4% of net sales, in the first six months of 2019 versus $82.0 million, or 13.1% of net sales, in the first six months of 2018.
The gross profit margin percentage increased primarily as a result of the 9.3% unit volume increase and an increase in the spread between the average price paid for a pound of raw copper and the average sale price for a pound of copper in the first six months of 2019 versus the first six months of 2018 due primarily to competitive industry pricing.
The copper spread increased 0.9% in the first six months of 2019 versus the first six months of 2018.
The spread increased as a result of the 5.9% decrease in the average sales price per copper pound sold while the per pound cost of raw copper decreased 9.1%.
In nominal dollars, the sales price decreased less than the cost of copper.
During the same period in 2018, LIFO adjustments were recorded, increasing cost of sales by $3.7 million.
Based on current copper prices, there is no LCM adjustment necessary.
Future reductions in the price of copper could require the Company to record an LCM adjustment against the related inventory balance, which would result in a negative impact on net income.
Selling expenses for the first six months of 2019 increased to $33.7 million, or 5.2% of net sales, compared to $32.9 million, or



5.2% of net sales, in the same period of 2018.
Freight costs for the first six months of 2019 decreased to 2.7% of net sales, versus 2.8% of net sales for the first six months of 2018.
General and administrative expenses were $15.1 million, or 2.3% of net sales, in the first half of 2019 compared to $11.5 million, or 1.8% of net sales, in the first half of 2018.
The G&A increase was driven primarily by increased stock compensation expense, driven primarily by our strong stock price performance driving the mark to market accounting on stock appreciation rights.
The net stock compensation expense increased $2.8 million in the first six months of 2019 versus the first six months of 2018.
The Company did not record any bad debt expense during the first six months of 2019 and 2018.

Liquidity and Capital Resources



The Company maintains a substantial inventory of finished products to satisfy customers’ delivery requirements promptly.
As is customary in the building wire industry, the Company provides payment terms to most of its customers that exceed terms that it receives from its suppliers.
Copper suppliers generally give very short payment terms (less than 15 days) while the Company and the building wire industry give customers much longer terms.
In general, the Company’s standard payment terms result in the collection of a significant majority of net sales within approximately 75 days of the date of invoice.
As a result of this timing difference, building wire companies must have sufficient cash and access to capital resources to finance their working capital needs, thereby creating a barrier to entry for companies who do not have sufficient liquidity and capital resources.
The two largest components of working capital, receivables and inventory, and to a lesser extent, capital expenditures, are the primary drivers of the Company’s liquidity needs.
Capital expenditures have historically been necessary to expand and update the production capacity of the Company’s manufacturing operations.
The Company has historically satisfied its liquidity and capital expenditure needs with cash generated from operations and borrowings under its various debt arrangements.
The Company historically uses its revolving credit facility to manage day to day operating cash needs as required by daily fluctuations in working capital and has the facility in place should such a need arise in the future.
For more information on the Company’s revolving credit facility, see Note 6 to the Company’s financial statements included in Item 1 to this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Cash provided by operating activities was $27.9 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to $6.0 million of cash used in the first six months of 2018.
The following changes in components of cash flow from operations were notable.
The Company had net income of $31.2 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to net income of $29.4 million in the first six months of 2018.
Accounts receivable increased $20.6 million in the first six months of 2019 and $29.5 million in the first six months of 2018, resulting in a positive change in cash flow of $8.9 million in the first six months of 2019 versus the first six months of 2018.
Inventory value decreased $6.3 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to increasing $4.5 million in the first six months 2018 producing a positive swing in cash flow of $10.8 million in 2019 versus 2018.
Trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities provided cash of $2.3 million in the first six months of 2019 versus using $9.6 million in the first six months of 2018, resulting in a positive change in cash flow of $11.9 million.
In the first six months of 2019, changes in current and deferred taxes used cash of $1.1 million versus a $1.3 million use of cash in the first six months of 2018.
These changes in cash flow were the primary drivers of the $33.8 million increase in cash provided by operations in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018.
Cash used in investing activities increased to $21.2 million in the first six months of 2019 from $14.8 million in the first six months of 2018 due to higher capital expenditures on plant and equipment.
Cash used in financing activities in the first six months of 2019 consisted of $0.8 million of cash dividends paid, offset by $0.6 million of proceeds from exercised stock options.
These changes in cash flow used $0.3 million cash in financing activities for the first six months of 2019 versus $0.5 million used in the first six months of 2018.
As of June 30, 2019, the balance on the Company’s revolving line of credit remained at zero.
The Company’s cash balance was $184.8 million at June 30, 2019 versus $102.0 million at June 30, 2018, as a result of the changes in cash flow discussed above.
The total capital expenditures for all of 2019 associated with these projects are currently estimated to be between $40 million and $45 million.
We have plans on the drawing board for significant capital expenditures, but these plans have been delayed by issues arising in connection with a highway expansion project which may bisect our property.
The Company believes that the current cash balance, cash flow from operations, and the financing available from its revolving credit facility will satisfy anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements during 2019.
