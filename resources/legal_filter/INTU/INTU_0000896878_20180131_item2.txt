Key Challenges and Risks
As we continue transitioning to offer more connected services, the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. Because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data. We are investing significant management attention and resources in our 
  Intuit Q2 Fiscal 2018 Form 10-Q 23  
information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
Overview of Financial Results
The most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole, for each reportable segment, and for product lines within each reportable segment; operating income growth and operating income margins for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment; earnings per share; and cash flow from operations. We also track certain non-financial drivers of revenue growth and, when material, identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below. These non-financial drivers include, for example, customer growth and retention for all of our businesses and transaction volume for our payment processing business. Total credit and debit card transaction volume correlates strongly with the macroeconomic environment and is one of the key drivers of revenue growth in our payment processing business. Customers for our connected services offerings have generally grown faster than those for our traditional desktop software offerings, reflecting our strategic focus on connected services over the past few years. Connected services (total service and other revenue) generated $3.8 billion or 73% of our total revenue in fiscal 2017. We expect connected services revenue as a percentage of our total revenue to continue to grow in the future.

Current Fiscal Quarter
Operating income decreased 9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the same quarter of fiscal 2017. Operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was impacted by higher costs and expenses, including higher spending for staffing, outside services, advertising and other marketing programs, and share-based compensation. See “Operating Expenses” later in this Item 2 for more information.
Fiscal Year to Date
We recorded a net loss of $38 million for the first six months of fiscal 2018 compared to a net loss of $17 million for the same period of fiscal 2017. The net loss for the first six months of fiscal 2018 includes a $39 million tax charge related to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax asset balance as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act. This charge was partially offset by tax benefits related to share-based compensation expense. See “Non-Operating Income and Expenses - Income Taxes” later in this Item 2 for more information. Net loss per share for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was $0.15 compared $0.07 in the same period a year ago.

Segment Results
The information below is organized in accordance with our three reportable segments. See “Executive Overview – About Intuit” earlier in this Item 2 and Note 10 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information. All of our segments operate primarily in the United States and sell primarily to customers in the United States. International total net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for all periods presented.
  Intuit Q2 Fiscal 2018 Form 10-Q 26  
Product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks Desktop software products, including Desktop Pro, Desktop for Mac, Desktop Premier, and Enterprise; QuickBooks Basic Payroll and QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll; QuickBooks Point of Sale solutions; ProAdvisor Program memberships for the accounting professionals who serve small businesses; and financial supplies.
Service and other revenue is derived primarily from our QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Self-Employed financial and business management offerings; QuickBooks Desktop Pro Plus, QuickBooks Desktop Premier Plus, and QuickBooks Enterprise with Hosting, our subscription offerings; QuickBooks Enterprise term licenses and QuickBooks technical support plans; small business payroll services, including QuickBooks Online Payroll, Intuit Online Payroll, QuickBooks Assisted Payroll, and Intuit Full Service Payroll; and payment processing services for small businesses.
Online Ecosystem revenue increased 39% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and 37% in the first six months of fiscal 2018. The revenue growth in both periods was driven by customer acquisition. At January 31, 2018 QuickBooks Online subscribers were 2.8 million, up 51% compared with the same point in time a year ago. Online Services revenue increased 21% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and increased 18% in the first six months of fiscal 2018 due to customer growth in online payroll and payments.
Desktop Ecosystem revenue increased 9% in both the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 driven by growth in QuickBooks Enterprise subscribers and average revenue per customer. QuickBooks Desktop units declined 15% and 24% in those periods.
  Intuit Q2 Fiscal 2018 Form 10-Q 27  
 Consumer
Product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax desktop tax return preparation software.
Service and other revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax Online tax return preparation services and electronic tax filing services.
Total Consumer segment revenue increased $40 million or 11% in the first six months of fiscal 2018 compared with the same period of fiscal 2017, primarily driven by an increase in average revenue per customer. Revenue growth in the fiscal 2018 period was partially impacted by a later opening of the tax season, with the IRS accepting returns on January 29, as compared to January 23 last year. Because of the seasonality of our Consumer revenue, we do not believe that revenue in our Consumer segment in the first six months of fiscal 2018 is indicative of revenue trends for the current fiscal year. We will not have substantially complete results for the 2017 tax season until the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Consumer segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased slightly in the first six months of fiscal 2018 compared to the same period of fiscal 2017. The higher revenue described above was offset by higher expenses including staffing, advertising, and other marketing programs.
  Intuit Q2 Fiscal 2018 Form 10-Q 28  
 Strategic Partner
Product revenue is derived primarily from Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProFile desktop tax preparation software products.
Service and other revenue is derived primarily from ProConnect Tax Online tax return preparation, bank products, and related services that complement the tax return preparation process.
The Strategic Partner segment targets professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and tax preparation and filing. 
Total Strategic Partner segment revenue decreased slightly in the first six months of fiscal 2018 compared with the same period of fiscal 2017. Strategic Partner segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased slightly in the first six months of fiscal 2018 compared with the same period of fiscal 2017.

Overview
At January 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $726 million, a slight decrease compared to July 31, 2017 due to the factors discussed under “Statements of Cash Flows” below. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, and borrowings under our credit facility. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs and debt repayment, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and the payment of cash dividends. As discussed in “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 2, our business is subject to significant seasonality. The balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern. We believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future.
We have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so during the balance of fiscal 2018. Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $726 million at January 31, 2018, none of those funds were restricted, and approximately 66% of those funds were located in the U.S. Our unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and stock repurchases. At January 31, 2018, $640 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We intend to repay the outstanding balance during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. We expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs.

Statements of Cash Flows
The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for the first six months of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. See the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for complete statements of cash flows for those periods.
Stock Repurchase Programs, Treasury Shares, and Dividends on Common Stock
As described in Note 8 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, during the first six months of fiscal 2018 we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock under repurchase programs that our Board of Directors has authorized. At January 31, 2018, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $1.3 billion for stock repurchases. We currently expect to continue repurchasing our common stock on a quarterly basis; however, future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.
On February 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. The master credit agreement includes a $500 million unsecured term loan and a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on February 1, 2021. Under the master credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times. Advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. At January 31, 2018, $640 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional 
  Intuit Q2 Fiscal 2018 Form 10-Q 33  
lenders that are providing the credit facility. We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.
The master credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of any date and a ratio of annual EBITDA to annual interest expense of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended January 31, 2018.
Cash Held by Foreign Subsidiaries
At January 31, 2018, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
We presented our contractual obligations at July 31, 2017 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year then ended. On September 13, 2017 we signed an agreement that includes a minimum purchase commitment of $450 million through August 31, 2022. There were no other significant changes to our contractual obligations during the first six months of fiscal 2018.
