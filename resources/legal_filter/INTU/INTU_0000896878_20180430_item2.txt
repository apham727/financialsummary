Key Challenges and Risks
As we continue transitioning to offer more connected services, the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. Because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data. We are investing significant management attention and resources in our

information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
Overview of Financial Results
The most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole, for each reportable segment, and for product lines within each reportable segment; operating income growth and operating income margins for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment; earnings per share; and cash flow from operations. We also track certain non-financial drivers of revenue growth and, when material, identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below. These non-financial drivers include, for example, customer growth and retention for all of our businesses and transaction volume for our payment processing business. Total credit and debit card transaction volume correlates strongly with the macroeconomic environment and is one of the key drivers of revenue growth in our payment processing business. Customers for our connected services offerings have generally grown faster than those for our traditional desktop software offerings, reflecting our strategic focus on connected services over the past few years. Connected services (total service and other revenue) generated $3.8 billion or 73% of our total revenue in fiscal 2017. We expect connected services revenue as a percentage of our total revenue to continue to grow in the future. 
We ended the first nine months of fiscal 2018 with cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $1.9 billion.

Current Fiscal Quarter
Operating income increased 12% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was due to the higher revenue described above partially offset by higher costs for advertising and other marketing programs, staffing, outside services, and share-based compensation. See “Operating Expenses” later in this Item 2 for more information.
Net income increased 24% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the same quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the increase in operating income described above and a lower effective tax rate in the fiscal 2018 period, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). Diluted net income per share increased 24% to $4.59, in line with the increase in net income.
Fiscal Year to Date
Operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased 12% compared with the same period of fiscal 2017. The increase was due to the higher revenue described above partially offset by higher costs for staffing, advertising and other marketing programs, outside services, and share-based compensation. See “Operating Expenses” later in this Item 2 for more information.

Online Ecosystem revenue increased 41% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 39% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. The revenue growth in both periods was driven by customer acquisition. At April 30, 2018 QuickBooks Online subscribers were 3.2 million, up 45% compared with the same point in time a year ago. Online Services revenue increased 27% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and increased 21% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 due to customer growth in online payroll and payments.
Desktop Ecosystem revenue increased 3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 7% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. The increase in revenue in both periods was driven by growth in QuickBooks Enterprise subscribers and average revenue per customer. QuickBooks Desktop units declined 8% and 18% in those periods.

 Consumer
Product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax desktop tax return preparation software.
Total Consumer segment revenue increased $305 million or 14% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared with the same period of fiscal 2017 due to a higher average revenue per customer, a 4% growth in TurboTax federal units, and a shift in mix to our higher end product offerings.
Segment operating income increased 14% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 due to higher revenue which was partially offset by higher expenses including staffing, advertising, and other marketing programs.

Total Strategic Partner segment revenue increased $13 million or 4% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared with the same period of fiscal 2017. Segment operating income increased 8% in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 primarily due to the higher revenue and relatively stable spending.

At April 30, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.9 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion from July 31, 2017 due to the factors discussed under “Statements of Cash Flows” below. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, and borrowings under our credit facility. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs and debt repayment, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and the payment of cash dividends. As discussed in “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 2, our business is subject to significant seasonality. The balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern. We believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future.
We have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $1.9 billion at April 30, 2018. None of those funds were restricted and approximately 87% of those funds were located in the U.S. Our unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and stock repurchases. At April 30, 2018, no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We expect to pay approximately $320 million in income taxes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. We expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs.
Statements of Cash Flows
The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. See the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for complete statements of cash flows for those periods.

Stock Repurchase Programs, Treasury Shares, and Dividends on Common Stock
As described in Note 8 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, during the first nine months of fiscal 2018 we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock under repurchase programs that our Board of Directors has authorized. At April 30, 2018, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $1.2 billion for stock repurchases. We currently expect to continue repurchasing our common stock on a quarterly basis; however, future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.
On February 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. The master credit agreement includes a $500 million unsecured term loan and a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on February 1, 2021. Under the master credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times. Advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. At April 30, 2018, no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility. We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.
The master credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of any date and a ratio of annual EBITDA to annual interest expense of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended April 30, 2018.

Cash Held by Foreign Subsidiaries
At April 30, 2018, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
We presented our contractual obligations at July 31, 2017 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year then ended. On September 13, 2017 we signed an agreement that includes a minimum purchase commitment of $450 million through August 31, 2022. There were no other significant changes to our contractual obligations during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
