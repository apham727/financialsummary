We adopted the new accounting standards for revenue recognition effective August 1, 2018. Beginning with the first quarter of our fiscal 2019, our financial results reflect the adoption of the standards with the prior periods restated accordingly. See Note 1 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information.
The rapid expansion of cloud-based services is creating a more dynamic and highly competitive software industry. High availability and speed of service are reshaping customer expectations around the world. These shifts are accelerating product introductions and enhancements. Among cloud-based service companies, free business models and micro-job solutions are also becoming more prevalent within the industry. Personalization and data-driven insights, augmented by artificial intelligence and machine learning, are transforming the way that people manage their financial lives.
Our Consumer and Strategic Partner offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively.
As we offer more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. Because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data. We are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
For our consumer and professional tax offerings, we have implemented additional security measures and are continuing to work with state and federal governments to share information regarding suspicious filings. We continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud.
We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, software subscriptions, hosted services, payroll services, merchant payment processing services, financial supplies and hardware. Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. In determining how revenue should be recognized, a five-step process is used, which requires judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process. These judgments and estimates include (1) identifying performance obligations in the contract; (2) determining whether the performance obligations are distinct; (3) determining the standalone sales price (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation; (4) determining the timing of revenue recognition for distinct performance obligations; and (5) estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price. If we were to change any of these judgments or estimates, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue we report in a particular period. For additional information, see “Revenue Recognition” in Note 1 to the financial statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.
We recorded net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 of $34 million compared with a net loss of $2 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2018. During the three months ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $41 million and $25 million, respectively, in our provision for income taxes. The increase in excess tax benefits on share-based compensation was primarily due to an increase in stock option exercises during the period and resulted in net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to a net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Diluted net income per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.13, compared to a diluted net loss per share of $0.01 in the same quarter of fiscal 2018.
The information below is organized in accordance with our three reportable segments. See “Executive Overview – About Intuit” earlier in this Item 2 and Note 9 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information. All of our segments operate and sell to customers primarily in the United States. International total net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for all periods presented.
Segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. See “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 2 for a description of the seasonality of our business. Segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, general and administrative expenses, and share-based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific segments. These unallocated costs totaled $402 million in the first three months of fiscal 2019 and $372 million in the first three months of fiscal 2018. Unallocated costs increased in the fiscal 2019 period due to increased corporate product development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expenses in support of the growth of our businesses and higher share-based compensation expenses. Segment expenses also do not include amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. See Note 9 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for reconciliations of total segment operating income or loss to consolidated operating income or loss for each fiscal period presented.
Our Desktop Ecosystem includes revenue from our QuickBooks Desktop packaged software products (Desktop Pro, Desktop for Mac, Desktop Premier, and QuickBooks Point of Sale); QuickBooks Desktop software subscriptions (QuickBooks Desktop Pro Plus, QuickBooks Desktop Premier Plus, and QuickBooks Enterprise, and ProAdvisor Program memberships for the accounting professionals who serve small businesses); desktop payroll products (QuickBooks Basic Payroll, QuickBooks Assisted Payroll and QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll); merchant payment processing services for small businesses who use desktop offerings; and financial supplies.
Segment product revenue is derived from revenue related to software license and version protection for our QuickBooks Desktop products and subscriptions, license and related updates for our desktop payroll products and financial supplies, which are all part of our Desktop Ecosystem. Segment service and other revenue is derived from our Online Ecosystem revenue; and Desktop Ecosystem revenue related to support and connected services for our QuickBooks Desktop and desktop payroll products and subscriptions and merchant payment processing services.
Online Ecosystem revenue increased 42% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same period of fiscal 2018. QuickBooks Online revenue increased 46% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 due to an increase in QuickBooks Online subscribers and average revenue per customer. At October 31, 2018 QuickBooks Online subscribers were 3.6 million, up 41% compared with the same point in time a year ago. Online Services revenue increased 36% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily due to customer growth in online payroll and payments and an increase in revenue from other online services.
Desktop Ecosystem revenue decreased 4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a decrease in revenue related to the delivery of version protection for our QuickBooks Enterprise customers, which was partially offset by an increase in license revenue related to customer acquisition for our QuickBooks Enterprise offering. QuickBooks Desktop subscribers were up 8% as compared with the same point in time a year ago.
Consumer segment product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax desktop tax return preparation software and related form updates.
Consumer segment service and other revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax Online products, electronic tax filing services and connected services, and also from our Mint and Turbo offerings.
Total Consumer segment revenue increased $16 million or 22% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same period of fiscal 2018. Due to the seasonal nature of our Consumer offerings, we typically generate nominal revenue from Consumer products and services in our first fiscal quarter compared with our second and third fiscal quarters. The majority of revenue for the first quarter of each fiscal year is for the filing of extended returns for the previous tax year. Because of the seasonality of our Consumer revenue, we do not believe that first quarter revenue in this segment is indicative of revenue trends for the current fiscal year. We will not have substantially complete results for the 2018 tax season until the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
In our first fiscal quarter, Consumer segment typically generates operating losses because Consumer revenue is nominal while operating expenses for functions such as research and development and general and administrative expenses continue at relatively consistent levels. We do not believe that Consumer segment operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same quarter of fiscal 2018 are indicative of trends for the full fiscal year.
Strategic Partner segment product revenue is derived primarily from Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProFile desktop tax preparation software products and related form updates.
Strategic Partner segment service and other revenue is derived primarily from ProConnect Tax Online tax products, electronic tax filing service, connected services and, bank products.
Total Strategic Partner segment revenue increased $1 million or 6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same period of fiscal 2018. Due to the seasonal nature of our Strategic Partner offerings, we typically generate nominal revenue from professional tax products and services in our first fiscal quarter compared with our second and third fiscal quarters. The majority of revenue for the first quarter of each fiscal year is for the filing of extended returns for the previous tax year. Because of the seasonality of our Strategic Partner revenue, we do not believe that first quarter revenue in this segment is indicative of revenue trends for the current fiscal year. We will not have substantially complete results for the 2018 tax season until the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
In our first fiscal quarter, Strategic Partner segment typically generates operating losses because revenue is nominal while operating expenses for functions such as research and development and general and administrative expenses continue at relatively consistent levels. We do not believe that Strategic Partner segment operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same quarter of fiscal 2018 are indicative of trends for the full fiscal year.
Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue was consistent in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same period of fiscal 2018. We expense costs of product revenue as they are incurred for delivered software and we do not defer any of these costs when product revenue is deferred. Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue was consistent in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same period of fiscal 2018.
Total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period of fiscal 2018. Total net revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $106 million or 12% while total operating expenses for the quarter increased $32 million or 4%. Total operating expenses increased about $14 million for higher staffing expenses due to higher headcount and about $14 million for higher advertising and marketing programs.
We recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $41 million and $25 million in our provision for income taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in excess tax benefits on share-based compensation was primarily due to an increase in stock option exercises during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. 
At October 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.3 billion, a decrease of $384 million from July 31, 2018 due to the factors discussed under “Statements of Cash Flows” below. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, and borrowings under our credit facility. In fiscal 2019 our U.S. statutory tax rate decreased to 21% as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, which increased our cash from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs and debt repayment, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and the payment of cash dividends. As discussed in “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 2, our business is subject to significant seasonality. The balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern. We believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future.
We have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $1.3 billion at October 31, 2018. None of those funds were restricted and approximately 82% of those funds were located in the U.S. Our unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and stock repurchases. At October 31, 2018, no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. Our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to these types of opportunities.
Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. We expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our 
stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs.
As described in Note 7 to the financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, during the first three months of fiscal 2019 we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock under repurchase programs that our Board of Directors has authorized. At October 31, 2018, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $3.1 billion for stock repurchases. We currently expect to continue repurchasing our common stock on a quarterly basis; however, future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.
We have continued to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of our outstanding common stock. During the three months ended October 31, 2018 we declared and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.47 per share of outstanding common stock for a total of $129 million. In November 2018 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.47 per share of outstanding common stock payable on January 18, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business on January 10, 2019. We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.
On February 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. The master credit agreement includes a $500 million unsecured term loan and a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on February 1, 2021. Under the master credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times. Advances under the revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. At October 31, 2018, no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility. We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.
The master credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of any date and a ratio of annual EBITDA to annual interest expense of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended October 31, 2018.
We presented our contractual obligations at July 31, 2018 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year then ended. There were no significant changes to our contractual obligations during the first three months of fiscal 2019.
