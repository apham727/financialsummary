Key Challenges and Risks
As we offer more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. Because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data. We are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.

Net income increased $192 million or 16% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the same quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the increase in operating income described above, and a lower effective tax rate in the fiscal 2019 period, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act).

Interest and Other Income, Net
For the three and nine months ended April 30, 2019, we recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $20 million and $69 million, respectively, in our provision for income taxes. For the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018, we recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $8 million and $41 million, respectively, in our provision for income taxes.
At April 30, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $3.3 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion from July 31, 2018 due to the factors discussed under “Statements of Cash Flows” below. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, and borrowings under our credit facility. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs and debt repayment, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and the payment of cash dividends. As discussed in “Executive Overview – Industry Trends and Seasonality” earlier in this Item 2, our business is subject to significant seasonality. The balance of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern. We believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future.
  Intuit Q3 Fiscal 2019 Form 10-Q 37  
We have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $3.3 billion at April 30, 2019. None of those funds were restricted and approximately 92% of those funds were located in the U.S. Our unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and stock repurchases. At April 30, 2019, no amounts were outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility. Our secured revolving credit facility is available to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses. At April 30, 2019, $48 million was outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility.

stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.
On February 1, 2016 we entered into a master credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a five-year credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion. The master credit agreement includes a $500 million unsecured term loan and a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on February 1, 2021. Under the master credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the unsecured revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times. Advances under the unsecured revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.9% to 1.5%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. At April 30, 2019, no amounts were outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility. We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.
The master credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of any date and a ratio of annual EBITDA to annual interest expense of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended April 30, 2019.
On May 2, 2019 we entered into an amendment to the master credit agreement. The amendment extends the maturity date of the unsecured revolving credit facility to May 2, 2024 and modifies the interest rate on the unsecured revolving credit facility to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.1% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 0.69% to 1.1%. Additionally, the amendment modifies the unsecured term loan to $400 million, decreases the interest rate on the term loan to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.125% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 0.625% to 1.125% and reduces the amount available to increase commitments under the term loan to $400 million in the aggregate. Actual margins under the unsecured revolving credit facility and term loan continue to be based on our senior unsecured debt credit ratings.
On February 19, 2019, a subsidiary of Intuit entered into a $300 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender. The revolving credit facility is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. Advances under this secured revolving credit facility are used to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses. The secured revolving credit facility is available for use for a term of two years and accrues interest at LIBOR plus 2.39%. Unused portions of the credit facility accrue interest at a rate of 0.50%. Outstanding advances mature on August 19, 2021 and payments made prior to February 19, 2020 are subject to a 1% prepayment fee. The agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios. We remained in compliance with these covenants at all times during the quarter ended April 30, 2019. At April 30, 2019, $48 million was outstanding under this facility, with a weighted-average interest rate of 8.06%, which includes the unused facility fee. The outstanding balance is secured by cash and loans to qualified small businesses totaling $76 million.
