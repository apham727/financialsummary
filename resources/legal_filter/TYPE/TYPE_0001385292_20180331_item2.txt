For a description of our Creative Professional revenue and related accounting policy, see Note 4.  
For a description of our OEM revenue and related accounting policy, see Note 4.  
Service revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue due primarily to the growth of our SaaS-based product offerings. Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased from 84.5% to 79.0%. These decreases are primarily due to additional non-recurring royalty expense for which there was no corresponding revenue in the period in accordance with ASC 606. Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased from 76.7% to 73.9%. See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.  
While revenue from services has grown to a level of significance requiring separate disclosure, we continue to operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.  
The following discussion compares the three months ended March 31, 2018 with the three months ended March 31, 2017.  
Revenue was $56.7 million and $52.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $4.2 million, or 8.0%.  
Creative Professional revenue increased $7.9 million, or 29.3%, to $35.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $27.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, mainly due to growth in sales of revenue from our enterprise customers, including the launch of our Mosaic solution and higher service revenue as SaaS offerings continue to become a larger part of our offering portfolio.  
Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was $12.4 million and $8.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in cost of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 is partially a result of the increase in revenue and partially due to $2.2 million of additional non-recurring royalty expense for which there was no corresponding revenue item in the period in accordance with ASC 606. As a percentage of sales, cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was 22.0% and 16.7% of total revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
The portion of cost of revenue consisting of amortization of acquired technology was unchanged at $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
Marketing and Selling. Marketing and selling expense was $20.1 million and $21.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 5.5%, mainly due to lower personnel expenses. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, partially due to the Olapic restructuring in the fall of 2017 and other decreases in headcount, which were partially offset by increased variable compensation and annual salary increases. A net increase in infrastructure expenses, such as software and facilities, provided a $0.2 million increase period over period.  
Research and Development. Research and development expense was $9.4 million and $9.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1.2%.  
General and Administrative. General and administrative expense increased $4.8 million, or 43.6%, to $15.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $10.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Outside consulting and legal expenses increased $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to additional expenses incurred related to shareholder activities. Personnel and personnel related expenses increased $1.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, the result of increased headcount mainly from key hiring during the second half of 2017 and annual salary increases. Increased infrastructure expenses, such as software expenses and depreciation, together contributed $0.5 million to the overall increase in general and administrative expenses, period over period.  
Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets was unchanged at $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.  
Interest expense, net of interest income was $0.7 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.1 million, or 15.4%, mainly due to borrowings under our revolving line of credit.  
Loss on derivatives was a loss of $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to a loss of $54 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2017, the net result of changes in the market value of our 30-day forward currency derivative contracts.  
      The statutory tax rate in the three months ended March 31, 2018 is 21.0%, as compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0% in the same period in 2017.  
      Foreign rate differential increased our effective rate 33.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to a decrease of 3.8% in the same period in 2017, due to changes in tax treatment of foreign earnings under The Act. These changes include significant new limitations on the ability to utilize foreign tax credits, and the effects of the new Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions. These provisions have resulted in a significantly higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings.  
      Non-deductible expenses added 8.2% to the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 20.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to changes in the deductibility of officers compensation under The Act, partially offset by the reduction in the statutory rate and a decrease in non-deductible acquisition-related compensation expense for the period.  
In addition, a net windfall on stock based compensation resulted in a 3.2% increase in the effective rate for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to a shortfall rate in the same period in 2017 that resulted in a 40.1% reduction in the effective rate.   
Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements may be found in Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, private and public stock sales and long-term debt arrangements, as described below. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, our cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. At March 31, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $85.4 million and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility, of which there was $90.0 million of outstanding borrowings. Our liquidity and cash flows in the three months ended March 31, 2017, included share purchases made under a share repurchase program, which ended on December 31, 2017. Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the operations of our existing business, our potential strategic expansion and future acquisitions we might undertake.  
Variations in operating cash flows occur from time-to-time, because our enterprise customers make upfront payments on subscription revenue. These payments are required under the terms of our license agreements and can cause large fluctuations in accounts receivable and deferred revenue. The timing and extent of such payments may significantly impact our cash balances. We generated $7.5 million in cash from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Net loss, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, loss on retirement of assets, amortization of deferred financing costs, accreted interest, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes, and unrealized currency gain on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $1.4 million in cash. Decreased accrued expenses offset by increased accounts payable used $2.7 million in cash, primarily a result of the payment of 2017 accrued variable compensation. Increased deferred revenue and decreased accounts receivable generated $10.8 million in cash as a result of customer payments received in Q1, net of an increase in unbilled receivables due to the adoption of ASC 606. Prepaid expenses and other assets used $1.3 million in cash, mainly due to an increase in capitalized contract costs related to the adoption of ASC 606. Accrued income taxes used $0.7 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.  
We generated $5.6 million in cash from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net loss, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred financing costs, accreted interest, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes, and unrealized currency gain on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $5.4 million in cash. Decreased accrued expenses and accounts payable used $4.5 million in cash, primarily a result of the payment of 2016 accrued variable compensation. Increased deferred revenue and decreased accounts receivable, offset by increased prepaid expenses generated $5.3 million in cash, mainly due to timing. Accrued income taxes used $0.6 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we used $1.6 million in investing activities for the purchase of $1.4 million of property and equipment and $0.2 million for acquisition of intangible assets. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we used $2.0 million in investing activities for the purchase of property and equipment.  
Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $6.3 million. We received cash from exercises of stock options of $2.6 million. We paid a cash dividend of $4.7 million and we paid $3.0 million on our outstanding revolving line of credit. We also used $1.2 million for employee taxes on shares withheld. Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $8.4 million. We received cash from exercises of stock options of $0.3 million. We paid a cash dividend of $4.6 million and we paid $3.0 million on our outstanding revolving line of credit. We also purchased $0.7 million of treasury stock and paid $0.5 million in employee taxes on shares withheld in the three months ended March 31, 2017.  
On February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an $0.116 per share, or $4.9 million, quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The record date was April 2, 2018 and the dividend was paid to shareholders on April 20, 2018. We anticipate this to be a recurring quarterly dividend with future payments and record dates, subject to board approval. On April 2, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a $0.116 per share quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The record date is set for July 2, 2018 and the dividend is payable to shareholders of record on July 20, 2018.  
The Credit Facility also contains provisions for an increased interest rate during periods of default. We do not believe that these covenants will affect our ability to operate our business, and we were in compliance with all covenants under our Credit Facility as of March 31, 2018.  
In our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls, in addition to Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above, we discuss a key measure that is not calculated according to GAAP. This non-GAAP measure is net adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock based compensation expense and acquisition-related compensation. We use net adjusted EBITDA as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business. We use net adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our board of directors, determining bonus compensation for our employees based on operating performance and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations. We believe that net adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period-to-period without direct correlation to underlying operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. We believe that trends in our net adjusted EBITDA may be valuable indicators of our operating performance.
