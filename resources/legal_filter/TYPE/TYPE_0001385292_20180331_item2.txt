Cost of Revenue  
Critical Accounting Policies  
The following discussion compares the three months ended March 31, 2018 with the three months ended March 31, 2017.  
Revenue by Market  
Revenue  
Revenue was $56.7 million and $52.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $4.2 million, or 8.0%.  
Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit  
Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was $12.4 million and $8.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in cost of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 is partially a result of the increase in revenue and partially due to $2.2 million of additional non-recurring royalty expense for which there was no corresponding revenue item in the period in accordance with ASC 606. As a percentage of sales, cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was 22.0% and 16.7% of total revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
The portion of cost of revenue consisting of amortization of acquired technology was unchanged at $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
Gross profit decreased 5.1% to 76.5% in the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 81.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in gross profit in the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, was primarily due to the additional non-recurring royalty expense as described above.  
Operating Expenses  
Marketing and Selling. Marketing and selling expense was $20.1 million and $21.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 5.5%, mainly due to lower personnel expenses. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, partially due to the Olapic restructuring in the fall of 2017 and other decreases in headcount, which were partially offset by increased variable compensation and annual salary increases. A net increase in infrastructure expenses, such as software and facilities, provided a $0.2 million increase period over period.  
Research and Development. Research and development expense was $9.4 million and $9.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1.2%.  
General and Administrative. General and administrative expense increased $4.8 million, or 43.6%, to $15.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $10.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Outside consulting and legal expenses increased $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to additional expenses incurred related to shareholder activities. Personnel and personnel related expenses increased $1.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017, the result of increased headcount mainly from key hiring during the second half of 2017 and annual salary increases. Increased infrastructure expenses, such as software expenses and depreciation, together contributed $0.5 million to the overall increase in general and administrative expenses, period over period.  
Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets was unchanged at $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.  
Interest Expense, Net  
Interest expense, net of interest income was $0.7 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $0.1 million, or 15.4%, mainly due to borrowings under our revolving line of credit.  
Loss on Derivatives  
Loss on derivatives was a loss of $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to a loss of $54 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2017, the net result of changes in the market value of our 30-day forward currency derivative contracts.  
      Foreign rate differential increased our effective rate 33.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to a decrease of 3.8% in the same period in 2017, due to changes in tax treatment of foreign earnings under The Act. These changes include significant new limitations on the ability to utilize foreign tax credits, and the effects of the new Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions. These provisions have resulted in a significantly higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings.  
      Non-deductible expenses added 8.2% to the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 20.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to changes in the deductibility of officers compensation under The Act, partially offset by the reduction in the statutory rate and a decrease in non-deductible acquisition-related compensation expense for the period.  
In addition, a net windfall on stock based compensation resulted in a 3.2% increase in the effective rate for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to a shortfall rate in the same period in 2017 that resulted in a 40.1% reduction in the effective rate.   
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements may be found in Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.  
Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, private and public stock sales and long-term debt arrangements, as described below. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, our cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. At March 31, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $85.4 million and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility, of which there was $90.0 million of outstanding borrowings. Our liquidity and cash flows in the three months ended March 31, 2017, included share purchases made under a share repurchase program, which ended on December 31, 2017. Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the operations of our existing business, our potential strategic expansion and future acquisitions we might undertake.  
Operating Activities  
Variations in operating cash flows occur from time-to-time, because our enterprise customers make upfront payments on subscription revenue. These payments are required under the terms of our license agreements and can cause large fluctuations in accounts receivable and deferred revenue. The timing and extent of such payments may significantly impact our cash balances. We generated $7.5 million in cash from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Net loss, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, loss on retirement of assets, amortization of deferred financing costs, accreted interest, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes, and unrealized currency gain on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $1.4 million in cash. Decreased accrued expenses offset by increased accounts payable used $2.7 million in cash, primarily a result of the payment of 2017 accrued variable compensation. Increased deferred revenue and decreased accounts receivable generated $10.8 million in cash as a result of customer payments received in Q1, net of an increase in unbilled receivables due to the adoption of ASC 606. Prepaid expenses and other assets used $1.3 million in cash, mainly due to an increase in capitalized contract costs related to the adoption of ASC 606. Accrued income taxes used $0.7 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.  
We generated $5.6 million in cash from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net loss, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred financing costs, accreted interest, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes, and unrealized currency gain on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $5.4 million in cash. Decreased accrued expenses and accounts payable used $4.5 million in cash, primarily a result of the payment of 2016 accrued variable compensation. Increased deferred revenue and decreased accounts receivable, offset by increased prepaid expenses generated $5.3 million in cash, mainly due to timing. Accrued income taxes used $0.6 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  
Investing Activities  
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we used $1.6 million in investing activities for the purchase of $1.4 million of property and equipment and $0.2 million for acquisition of intangible assets. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we used $2.0 million in investing activities for the purchase of property and equipment.  
Financing Activities  
Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $6.3 million. We received cash from exercises of stock options of $2.6 million. We paid a cash dividend of $4.7 million and we paid $3.0 million on our outstanding revolving line of credit. We also used $1.2 million for employee taxes on shares withheld. Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $8.4 million. We received cash from exercises of stock options of $0.3 million. We paid a cash dividend of $4.6 million and we paid $3.0 million on our outstanding revolving line of credit. We also purchased $0.7 million of treasury stock and paid $0.5 million in employee taxes on shares withheld in the three months ended March 31, 2017.  
Dividends  
On February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an $0.116 per share, or $4.9 million, quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The record date was April 2, 2018 and the dividend was paid to shareholders on April 20, 2018. We anticipate this to be a recurring quarterly dividend with future payments and record dates, subject to board approval. On April 2, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a $0.116 per share quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The record date is set for July 2, 2018 and the dividend is payable to shareholders of record on July 20, 2018.  
On September 15, 2015, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement) by and among the Company, the Companys subsidiary, Monotype Imaging Inc., any financial institution that becomes a Lender (as defined therein) and Silicon Valley Bank, as agent which provides for a five-year $150.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility permits the Company to request that the Lenders, at their election, increase the secured credit facility to a maximum of $200.0 million. The Credit Facility is available to the Company on a revolving basis through September 15, 2020. Repayment of any amounts borrowed is not required until maturity of the Credit Facility; however, the Company may repay any amounts borrowed at any time, without premium or penalty. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear a variable rate not less than zero based upon, at the Companys option, either LIBOR or the higher of (i) the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, and (ii) 0.5% plus the overnight federal funds rate, plus in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for LIBOR loans, based on the applicable leverage ratio, is 1.25%, 1.50% or 1.75% per annum, and the applicable margin for base rate loans, based on the applicable leverage ratio, is either 0.25%, 0.50% or 0.75%% per annum. At March 31, 2018, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.6% for LIBOR, and at December 31, 2017, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.1% for LIBOR. The Company had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility of $90.0 million at March 31, 2018, and $93.0 million at December 31, 2017. The Credit Facility has $0.5 million reserved for one stand-by letter of credit in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $59.5 million and $56.5 million available for borrowing at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
