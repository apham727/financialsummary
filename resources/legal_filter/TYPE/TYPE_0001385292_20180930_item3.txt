Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  
Concentration of Revenue and Credit Risk  
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. Cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposits. Deposits of cash held outside the United States totaled approximately $29.5 million and $24.3 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.  
Interest Rate Risk  
Our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility of $80.0 million and $93.0 million, respectively. The interest rate on our Credit Facility fluctuates with either the prime rate or the LIBOR interest rate and at September 30, 2018 our rate was 3.8% for LIBOR. A 10% increase in the rate would increase our annual interest expense by $0.2 million.  
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  
As discussed in Note 1, our wholly-owned Olapic Argentina S.A. subsidiary employs approximately 99 people whose functions mainly include development, sales support and administration. The Argentinian economy was recently determined to be highly inflationary. Argentinas inflation rate reached this threshold with the quarterly period ended June 30, 2018. In accordance with this designation, we were required to apply the guidance in ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters, (Subtopic ASC 830-10-45-10), and account for a change in functional currency from the Argentinian peso to the U.S. dollar effective July 1, 2018. While we conduct our operation in Argentina Pesos, effective July 1, 2018, the functional currency was changed to the U.S. dollar. The operation is a service center supporting the companys products and generates no revenue. Thus, the expenses primarily consist of compensation and related costs, totaling approximately $0.4 million to $0.5 million per month. The change in functional currency to U.S. dollars did not have a material impact on our financial position, operating results or cash flows.
