For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 45.6% and 55.4%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 49.7% and 55.7%, respectively, of our total revenue. We expect that sales to international customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our products worldwide.  
We derive a significant portion of OEM revenue from a limited number of customers, in particular manufacturers of laser printers and consumer electronic devices. For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 34.9% and 23.8% of total revenue, respectively. One customer accounted for 14.9% of total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2018. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately 28.6% and 22.2% of total revenue, respectively. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 or 2018. If we are unable to maintain relationships with major customers or establish relationships with new customers, our licensing revenue will be adversely affected.

10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
License revenue increased primarily due to a large multi-year agreement with one of our display imaging customers signed in the second quarter of 2019. This was partially offset by a decline in printer revenue. Service revenue decreased in the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly due to increased customer churn in the last half of 2018. Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, was consistent at 84.8% and 84.9% in the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased to 69.7% in the second quarter of 2019, as compared to 78.8% in the same period in 2018. See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.  
While revenue from services has grown to a level of significance requiring separate disclosure, we continue to operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.  
The following discussion compares the three months ended June 30, 2019 with the three months ended June 30, 2018.  
Revenue was $63.2 million and $60.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase of $2.5 million, or 4.2%.  
Creative Professional revenue was $35.2 million and $38.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $3.2 million, or 8.3%, due to a decline in certain SAAS-based revenue and 
web-based sales mainly due to increased customer churn in the last half of 2018, partially offset by growth in sales to enterprise customers. 
The portion of cost of revenue consisting of amortization of acquired technology was $0.8 million and $0.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 2.0%.

Targeted marketing spending decreased in the second quarter of 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, due to portfolio decisions around discretionary programs, which was offset by higher rent expense stemming from headcount changes, period over period. 
Research and Development. Research and development expense decreased $1.7 million, or 20.0%, to $6.8 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $8.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, mainly due to lower personnel expenses.

Restructuring. Restructuring expense decreased $6.3 million, or 99.5%, to $32 thousand in the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $6.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018, a result of the restructuring action announced June 2018. See Note 14 for further details. 
Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets was $0.8 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 14.1%, mainly due to the write off intangible assets associated with the Swyft business in the second quarter of 2018. 
Interest expense, net of interest income was $0.7 million and $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 12.6%, mainly due to a reduction in the balance outstanding under our revolving line of credit and partially due to a decrease in interest rates.  
Other was an expense of $0.2 million and income of $0.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 137.8%, mainly due to currency fluctuations on our foreign denominated receivables and payables.  
The Company has reflected a reduction in its valuation allowance for foreign tax credits, resulting in a benefit of 10.2%, related to the amount of foreign tax credit carryforwards that the Company is estimating that it will be able to utilize based on 2019 taxable income. In the same period in 2018, there was no change to the valuation allowance.   
License revenue increased primarily due a large multi-year agreement with one of our display imaging customers mostly offset by a decline in printer revenue. Service revenue decreased in the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly due to increased customer churn in the last half of 2018.

Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased to 69.7% in the first half of 2019, as compared to 78.8% in the same period in 2018. See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue. Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, increased to 84.3% from 82.0%. The increase is primarily due to a large agreement with one of our display imaging customers in the six months ended June 30, 2019. Gross profit from service revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, decreased to 70.1% from 76.5%. See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.  
While revenue from services has grown to a level of significance requiring separate disclosure, we continue to operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.  
The following discussion compares the six months ended June 30, 2019 with the six months ended June 30, 2018.  
Revenue was $114.6 million and $117.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $2.8 million, or 2.4%.  
Creative Professional revenue was $68.0 million and $73.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, a decrease of $5.4 million, or 7.4%, due to a decline in certain SAAS-based revenue and 
web-based sales mainly due to increased customer churn in the last half of 2018. 
Cost of revenue excluding amortization of acquired technology decreased $1.8 million, or 8.0%, to $20.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to $22.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018. In the first half of 2018, there was $2.2 million of 
Amortization of acquired technology was unchanged at $1.7 million for both the six months periods June 30, 2019 and 2018.  
Gross profit was 80.5% and 79.5% of sales in the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase of 1.0 percentage point. The increase in gross profit in the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily due to the 
non-recurring royalty expense in the prior period that did not occur in the current period, partially offset by lower margins on Creative Professional revenue, as described above. 
Marketing and Selling. Marketing and selling expense was $35.7 million and $40.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, a decrease of $4.5 million, or 11.1%. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $3.9 million in the first half of 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly due to lower headcount during the first half of 2019 from our restructuring actions in the second and fourth quarters of 2018. Targeted marketing spending decreased $0.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, due to portfolio decisions around discretionary programs, which was partially offset by higher rent expense of $0.3 million stemming from headcount changes, period over period. 
Research and Development. Research and development expense decreased $3.6 million, or 20.0%, to $14.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $17.8 million in the same period in 2018 primarily due to lower personnel expenses. Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $3.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly due to lower headcount from restructuring actions in the second and fourth quarters of 2018. 
General and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased $3.9 million, or 14.1% to $23.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $27.5 million in the same period in 2018. Outside consulting and legal expenses decreased $2.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to the additional expenses incurred in the prior period related to shareholder activities. Personnel expenses decreased $1.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly due to lower headcount. 
Restructuring. Restructuring expense decreased $6.6 million, or 99.9%, to $8 thousand in the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $6.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018, a result of the restructuring action announced June 2018. See Note 14 for further details. 
Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets was $1.7 million and $2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 16.5%, mainly due to the write off intangible assets associated with the Swyft business in the second quarter of 2018.  
Interest expense, net of interest income was unchanged at $1.5 million for both the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.  
Other was an expense of $0.4 million and income of $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.9 million, or 176.8%, mainly due to currency fluctuations on our foreign denominated receivables and payables.  
The Company has reflected a reduction in its valuation allowance for foreign tax credits, resulting in a benefit of 10.2%, related to the amount of foreign tax credit carryforwards that the Company is estimating that it will be able to utilize based on 2019 taxable income. There was no such reduction in the prior period.   
Non-deductible expenses added 2.2% to the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to 14.2% for the same period in 2018, a result of the acceleration of the final payment of deferred compensation to the founders of Swyft in June 2018 and to two of the founders of Olapic in December 2018. As a result of those payments, the total amount of 
non-deductible compensation in the current period is reduced. In addition, the impact of these items as a percentage of pre-tax income is lower due to higher pre-tax income.   
Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, private and public stock sales and long-term debt arrangements, as described below. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. At June 30, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $47.8 million and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, of which there was $65.0 million of outstanding borrowings. On May 3, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock, which permitted purchases through June 7, 2019. In the six months ended June 30, 2019, we used $7.7 million in cash to purchase the remaining shares outstanding under the plan. Our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the operations of our existing business, our potential strategic expansion and future acquisitions we might undertake.  
addition to $0.2 million of prepaid software license renewals and $0.9 million of capitalized financing costs in connection with the new Credit Facility. Increased tax refunds receivable combined with decreased accrued income taxes used $4.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2019.  
Accrued expenses and accounts payable used $9.9 million, inclusive of large 
non-recurring payments of deferred compensation of $7.0 million, additional royalty payments resulting from the adoption of ASC 606 of $2.1 million and payment of investor relations advisor fees of $2.2 million. In addition we paid 2017 accrued variable compensation, offset by additional restructuring accruals. Decreased deferred revenue and increased accounts receivable generated $5.6 million in cash, primarily a result of customer payments received, net of an increase in unbilled receivables due to the adoption of ASC 606. Increased prepaid expense and other assets used $4.0 million in cash, mainly due to an increase in long term unbilled receivables and capitalized contract costs related to the adoption of ASC 606. Accrued income taxes used $1.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2018. 
During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we used $0.8 million in investing activities mainly for the purchase of property and equipment. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we used $2.3 million in investing activities mainly for the purchase of property and equipment.  
Cash used in financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $28.7 million. We received cash from the exercise of stock options of $0.3 million. We paid cash dividends of $9.6 million, and paid $10.2 million on our outstanding revolving line of credit. We also purchased $7.7 million in treasury stock and paid $1.5 million in employee taxes on shares withheld in the six months ended June 30, 2019. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $16.7 million. We received cash from exercises of stock options of $3.4 million. We paid cash dividends of $9.6 million and we paid $8.0 million on our outstanding revolving line of credit. We also purchased $1.0 million of treasury stock in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and paid $1.5 million in employee taxes on shares withheld in the six months ended June 30, 2018.  
On April 18, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a $0.116 per share quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The record date was July 1, 2019 and the dividend was paid to shareholders of record on July 19, 2019.  
pro-rata share of prior loan syndicate lenders that did not participate in the new facility were written off and charged to other expense in the first quarter of 2019. 
The New Credit Agreement includes financial covenants which require the Company to maintain (i) a consolidated leverage ratio of no greater than 3.25 to 1.0 or, upon a qualified acquisition subject to certain conditions, 3.75 to 1.0 and (ii) a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.0. At June 30, 2019, our consolidated leverage ratio was 0.59 to 1.0 and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 21.38 to 1.0. The New Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for transactions of this type and other affirmative and negative covenants agreed to by the parties, including, among others, limits on the Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt or liens, engage in sale-leaseback transactions, make loans, investments and acquisitions, incur additional indebtedness, engage in mergers, enter into asset sales, transact with affiliates and alter its business. Adjusted EBITDA, under the Credit Facility, is defined as consolidated net earnings (or loss), plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and share based compensation expense, plus acquisition expenses not to exceed $2.0 million, minus capitalized research and development expense, plus restructuring, issuance costs, cash 
non-operating expense shall not exceed 10% of Consolidated EBITDA. The New Credit Agreement also provides for a number of customary events of default, including, among others, payment, bankruptcy, covenant, representation and warranty, change of control and judgment defaults. Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of an event of default, could permit the Lenders under the New Credit Agreement to declare all amounts borrowed under the New Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. The obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries and secured by a lien on substantially all of the present and future property and assets of the Company and such subsidiaries, in each case, subject to limited exceptions and exclusions. 
The Credit Facility also contains provisions for an increased interest rate during periods of default. We do not believe that these covenants will affect our ability to operate our business, and we were in compliance with all covenants under our Credit Facility as of June 30, 2019.  
In our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls, in addition to Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above, we discuss a key measure that is not calculated according to GAAP. This 
non-recurring expenses. We use net adjusted EBITDA as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business. We use net adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our board of directors, determining bonus compensation for our employees based on operating performance and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations. We believe that net adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from 
period-to-period without direct correlation to underlying operating performance. We believe that these 
non-recurring expenses. We use 
period-to-period without direct correlation to underlying operating performance. We believe that these 
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, $1.4 million, or $0.03 per share, of stock based compensation expense was reversed as a result of forfeitures of awards by employees included in the restructuring plan. This non-recurring amount has been included in restructuring expenses.   
For the three months ended June 30, 2019, the amount primarily includes $0.7 million of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities. For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the amount includes $6.4 million of restructuring expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the amount primarily includes $0.7 million of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the amount includes $2.7 million of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities, $2.2 million of royalty expenses, recorded in cost of sales, associated with revenue that was not recognized under ASC 606 and $6.6 million of restructuring expenses.   
For the three months ended June 30, 2019, the amount primarily includes $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share, net of tax, of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities. For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the amount includes $4.9 million, or $0.12 per share, net of tax, of restructuring expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, the amount primarily includes $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share, net of tax, of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the amount includes $2.1 million, or $0.06 per share, net of tax, of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities, $1.7 million, or $0.04 per share, net of tax, of royalty expenses, recorded in cost of sales, associated with revenue that was not recognized under ASC 606 and $5.0 million, or $0.12 per share, net of tax, of restructuring expenses.   
Net adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP profitability measures such as income (loss) from operations and net income (loss). Net adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure has material limitations since it excludes the statement of income impact of depreciation and amortization expense and stock based compensation and therefore does not represent an accurate measure of profitability. We have significant intangible assets and amortization expense is a meaningful element in our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation. Stock based compensation and the associated expense has a meaningful impact on our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation. Non-recurring expenses, such as certain advisor fees, royalty expenses and restructuring expenses, have a meaningful impact on our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation. As a result, net adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income (loss) for complete analysis of our profitability, as net income (loss) includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable GAAP performance measure to net adjusted EBITDA. As net adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP, our definition of net adjusted EBITDA may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of the limitations that net adjusted EBITDA has as an analytical tool, investors should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP.
