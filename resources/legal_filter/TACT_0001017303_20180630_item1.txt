1.
Basis of presentation 



The accompanying unaudited financial statements of TransAct Technologies Incorporated (the "Company") have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP to be included in full year financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented have been included and are of a normal recurring nature.
These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The following table summarizes the activity recorded in the accrued product warranty liability during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Earnings per share 



The following table sets forth the reconciliation of basic weighted average shares outstanding and diluted weighted average shares outstanding: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, when the average market price of the common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related stock award during the period.
These outstanding stock awards are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
For the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, there were 196 thousand and 407 thousand, respectively, of potentially dilutive shares consisting of stock awards that were excluded from the calculation of earnings per diluted share.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, there were 147 thousand and 732 thousand, respectively, of potentially dilutive shares consisting of stock awards that were excluded from the calculation of earnings per diluted share.
5.
Shareholders' equity 



Changes in shareholders' equity for the six months ended June 30, 2018 were as follows (in thousands): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



For the three months ended June 30, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share, totaling $663 thousand, which was paid on June 15, 2018 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on May 21, 2018.

Accounting pronouncements 



The following accounting pronouncements will be adopted in future reporting periods: 



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors).
The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee.
This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively.
A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.
Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today.
ASU 2016-02 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840, Leases, and is effective for public entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is permitted.
The Company does have leases for equipment and real property which exceed 12 months and we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our financial statements.
The following accounting pronouncements were adopted during 2018: 



  1)   Revenue recognition:     



ASU No.
2014-09," Revenue from Contracts with Customers" and its related amendments (collectively, ASC 606) are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein.
This ASU is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by removing inconsistencies in revenue requirements; providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improving comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets; and providing more useful information to users of financial statements through improved revenue disclosure requirements.
Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective approach or modified retrospective approach to adopt the amended guidance.
We adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018 and elected the modified retrospective approach.
The results for periods before 2018 were not adjusted for the new standard and no cumulative effective for the change in accounting was recognized through retained earnings at the date of adoption.

Periods prior to January 1, 2018 



The Company's revenue recognition method prior to the adoption of ASC 606 can be found under Note 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies within the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
Periods commencing January 1, 2018 



In accordance with ASC 606, a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer.
Some of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while other contracts contain multiple performance obligations (most commonly when contracts include product and extended warranties).
A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price.
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer.
To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as price protection, reserves for returns and other allowances, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the "expected value" method or the "most likely amount" method depending on the nature of the variable consideration.
The transaction price is recognized upon shipment of the order when control of the goods is transferred to the customer and at the time the performance obligation is fulfilled.
We also sell a software solution, EPICENTRAL™, that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them in real-time at the slot machine.
EPICENTRALTM is primarily comprised of both a software component, which is licensed to the customer, and a hardware component.
EPICENTRAL™ software and hardware are integrated to deliver the system's full functionality.
The transaction prices from EPICENTRAL™ software license and hardware are recognized upon installation and formal acceptance by the customer when control of the license is transferred to the customer.
For out-of-warranty repairs, the transaction price is recognized after completion of the repair work is completed and the printer or terminal is returned to the customer, as control of the product is transferred to the customer.
Performance obligations are satisfied over-time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced, or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment.
For our separately priced extended warranty and maintenance agreements (including free one-year maintenance received by the customers upon completion of EPICENTRAL™ installation) revenue is recognized over-time as the customer receives the benefit.
The transaction price from the maintenance services is recognized ratably over-time, using output methods, as control of the services is transferred to the customer.
For extended warranties, the transaction price is recognized ratably over the warranty period, using output methods, as control of the services is transferred to the customer.
In the cases where there is more than one performance obligation in a customer arrangement, the Company typically uses the "standalone selling price" method to determine the transaction price to allocate to each performance obligation.
The Company sells the performance obligations separately and has established standalone selling prices for its products and services.
In the case of an overall price discount, the discount is applied to each performance obligation proportionately based on standalone selling price.
To determine the standalone selling price for initial EPICENTRAL™ installations, the Company uses the adjusted market assessment approach.

Changes in accounting policies and financial statement impact of adopting ASC 606 



Except for the changes below, we have consistently applied the accounting policies to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
As noted above, we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective approach which allows the Company to record any changes using the cumulative effect.
The adoption of the ASC 606 did not require the Company to record an adjustment to retained earnings at January 1, 2018 and did not have an impact on the consolidated income statement during the first six months of 2018, basic or diluted earnings per share, consolidated statement of cash flows or consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2018.
Costs to Obtain a Contract – Costs to obtain a contract, such as sales commissions, were previously expensed as incurred.
The Company applied the practical expedient for contracts with customers for a term of twelve months or less, in accordance with ASC 340-40-25-4, which allows TransAct to continue to expense sales commissions as incurred, since the expected amortization period of the cost to obtain a contract is less than 12 months.
No amounts were capitalized as of the adoption of ASC 606 or as of June 30, 2018.
Contract balances 



Our contract liabilities consist of customer pre-payments and deferred revenue.
The increase in customer pre-payments is due to increased sales to our European casino and gaming customers who sometimes require higher pre-payment amounts compared to our other customers.
We do not have any contract asset balances as of June 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017.
In the first six month of 2018, we recognized revenue of $372 thousand related to our contract liabilities at January 1, 2018.
Total contract liabilities consist of the following: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Remaining performance obligations 



Remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price of firm orders for which a good or service has not been delivered to our customer.
As of June 30, 2018, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $6.0 million.
The Company expects to recognize revenue on $5.0 million of our remaining performance obligations within the next twelve months, with the balance of these remaining performance obligations recognized within the next 24 months.
2017-09, "Compensation-Stock Compensation: Scope of modification accounting".
ASU 2017-09 provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718.
ASU No.
2017-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
The amendments are applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date.
We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 and the adoption has not resulted in a change to our financial statements.
