Impact of New Revenue Accounting Pronouncement 



As discussed in Note 2 to our Financial Statements, in January 2018 we adopted ASC 606, a single comprehensive model which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP, utilizing the cumulative effect approach.
Under the new guidance, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.
As a result of adopting ASC 606, beginning in 2018, the following key reclassifications have occurred: 



•  



Certain deferred contract costs that had been included in our client contracts and other current and non-current assets on our Balance Sheet were reclassified and presented separately as a non-current client contract asset, net of related amortization.
•  



Investments in client contracts on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows have been reclassified to operating activities from investing activities.
Since we adopted ASC 606 using the cumulative effect method, prior period comparative information in our Financial Statements have not been adjusted and continue to be as previously reported.
Refer to Note 2 for further detail and discussion regarding the adoption of ASC 606.
Acquisition Activity 



Business Ink 



As discussed in Note 5 to our Financial Statements, on February 28, 2018 we acquired Business Ink, a multi-channel communications company based in Austin, Texas, for approximately $70 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses.
For the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2018, Business Ink contributed cloud and related solutions revenues of $13.9 million and $34.9 million, respectively, and was slightly dilutive to our year-to-date operating results when factoring in acquired amortization expense.
Forte Payment Systems, Inc. 



As discussed in Note 5 to our Financial Statements, on October 1, 2018, we acquired Forte, a leading provider of advanced payment solutions headquartered in Allen, Texas.
We acquired Forte for a purchase price of approximately $85 million ($80 million, net of cash acquired), and held back approximately $13 million in cash subject to certain tax filings.
This represents a purchase price approximately equal to Forte’s 2018 projected revenues.
In addition, the stock purchase agreement includes provisions for $18.8 million of potential future earn-out payments over a four-year measurement period.
As we have not completed the valuation analysis and calculations necessary to finalize the required purchase price allocations, which may include allocations to goodwill and other intangible assets such as trademarks and trade names, developed technology, noncompetition agreements, and customer-related assets, the expected impact of the Forte acquisition is based on estimates for the amortization of acquired intangible assets.

Management Overview of Quarterly Results 



Third Quarter Highlights.
Revenues.
Our revenues for the third quarter of 2018 were $213.1 million, a 7% increase when compared to revenues of $199.2 million for the third quarter of 2017, with the increase mainly attributed to the acquisition of Business Ink on February 28, 2018.
Operating income for the third quarter of 2018 was $25.7 million, or a 12.0% operating margin percentage, compared to $28.4 million, or a 14.2% operating margin percentage for the third quarter of 2017, with the decrease in operating margin percentage reflective of costs associated with the integration of Business Ink and the continuation of planned investments aimed at generating future long-term growth in our business.
Diluted EPS.
Diluted EPS for the third quarter of 2018 was $0.49 compared to $0.44 for the third quarter of 2017, with the increase primarily attributed to a lower effective income tax rate resulting primarily from the Tax Reform Act enacted in December 2017.
Cash and Cash Flows.
As of September 30, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $199.3 million, as compared to $186.4 million as of June 30, 2018 and $261.4 million as of as of December 31, 2017.
Our cash flows from operating activities for the quarter ended September 30, 2018 were $47.1 million.
See the Liquidity section below for further discussion of our cash flows.
Significant Client Relationships  



Client Concentration.
A large percentage of our historical revenues have been generated from our largest clients, which are Comcast, Charter Corporation Inc. (“Charter”), and DISH Network Corporation (“DISH”).
Comcast Contract Renewal.
Our current agreement with Comcast runs through June 30, 2019, with an option for Comcast to extend the agreement for two consecutive one-year terms by exercising the renewal options no later than January 1, 2019 for the first extension and January 1, 2020 for the second extension option.
We are currently engaged in discussions with Comcast regarding contract renewal terms.
Although we believe our operating relationship with Comcast is good, there can be no assurances around the timing and/or the terms of any renewal arrangements at this time.
The Comcast agreement and related amendments, with confidential information redacted, is included in the exhibits to our periodic filings with the SEC.
Risk of Client Concentration.
There are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of total revenues are concentrated with a limited number of clients.
Critical Accounting Policies  



The preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to select appropriate accounting policies, and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies.
Those critical accounting policies were determined by considering the accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments.
The most critical accounting policies identified relate to the following items: (i) revenue recognition; (ii) impairment assessments of long-lived assets; (iii) income taxes; and (iv) loss contingencies.
Total revenues for the: (i) third quarter of 2018 were $213.1 million, a 7% increase when compared to $199.2 million for the third quarter of 2017; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $627.8 million, a 7% increase when compared to $584.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
The components of total revenues, discussed in more detail below, are as follows (in thousands): 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



25 



We use the location of the client as the basis of attributing revenues to individual countries.
Revenues by geographic regions for the third quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands): 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Cloud and Related Solutions Revenues.
Cloud and related solutions revenues for the: (i) third quarter of 2018 were $186.5 million, a 13% increase when compared to $164.8 million for the third quarter of 2017; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $551.4 million, a 15% increase when compared to $481.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
These increases in cloud and related solutions revenues for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2018 are mainly due to: (i) the revenues generated from the acquired Business Ink business of $13.9 million and $34.9 million, respectively; (ii) the application of ASC 606, which resulted in revenues of $6.2 million and $19.3 million, respectively, previously classified as software and services and maintenance revenues, now being classified as cloud and related solutions revenues; and (iii) the execution of and performance under additional managed services arrangements and the conversion of 1.5 million customer accounts onto ACP during the last six months of 2017.
Software and Services Revenues.
Software and services revenues for the: (i) third quarter of 2018 were $14.3 million, a 9% decrease when compared to $15.7 million for the third quarter of 2017; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $39.6 million, a 15% decrease when compared to $46.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
The decreases in software and services revenues for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2018 can be attributed mainly to the shift in our focus towards managed services arrangements, which are included in our cloud and related solutions revenues, and the application of ASC 606, which resulted in revenues of $1.6 million and $4.7 million, respectively, previously classified as software and services now being classified as cloud and related solutions.
Maintenance Revenues.
Maintenance revenues for the: (i) third quarter of 2018 were $12.3 million, a 34% decrease when compared to $18.7 million for the third quarter of 2017; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $36.8 million, a 35% decrease when compared to $56.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
These decreases in maintenance revenues for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2018 are primarily due to the application of ASC 606, which resulted in revenues of $5.2 million and $15.5 million, respectively, previously classified as maintenance now being classified as cloud and related solutions, with the remaining decrease attributed to the timing of maintenance renewals and related revenue recognition.
Total Expenses.
Our operating expenses for the: (i) third quarter of 2018 were $187.4 million, a 10% increase when compared to $170.8 million for the third quarter of 2017; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $552.3 million, a 9% increase when compared to $504.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
The components of total expenses are discussed in more detail below.
Cost of Revenues.
See our 2017 10-K for a description of the types of costs that are included in the individual line items for cost of revenues.

Total cloud and related solutions cost as a percentage of cloud and related solutions revenues for the: (i) third quarters of 2018 and 2017 were 51.0% and 48.5%, respectively; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were 50.3% and 48.4%, respectively.
Cost of Software and Services (Exclusive of Depreciation).
The cost of software and services for the: (i) third quarter of 2018 decreased 11% to $8.7 million, from $9.7 million for the third quarter of 2017; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased 18% to $25.8 million from $31.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.

Variability in quarterly revenues and operating results are inherent characteristics of companies that sell software licenses and perform professional services.
Cost of Maintenance (Exclusive of Depreciation).
The cost of maintenance for the: (i) third quarter of 2018 decreased 48% to $5.3 million, from $10.1 million for the third quarter of 2017; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased 46% to $16.6 million, from $30.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.

R&D Expense.
R&D expense for the: (i) third quarter of 2018 increased 4% to $31.5 million, from $30.3 million for the third quarter of 2017; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased 8% to $91.8 million, from $85.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
These increases are reflective of our heightened level of investment that began in early 2017.
As a percentage of total revenues, R&D expense for the third quarters of 2018 and 2017 were approximately 15%.
Our R&D efforts are focused on the continued evolution of our solutions that enable service providers worldwide to provide a more personalized customer experience while introducing new digital products and services.
This includes the continued investment in our cloud-based solutions (principally, around our Ascendon platform).
Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expense.
SG&A expense for the: (i) third quarter of 2018 increased 10% to $39.2 million, from $35.8 million for the third quarter of 2017; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased 10% to $120.5 million, from $110.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
Our SG&A costs as a percentage of total revenues for the third quarters of 2018 and 2017 were approximately 18%.
Depreciation.
Depreciation expense for the: (i) third quarter of 2018 increased 44% to $4.8 million, from $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2017; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased 33% to $13.3 million, from $10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
These increases can be primarily attributed to the increased level of capital expenditures we have made over the last twelve months, to include depreciation expense for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2018 of $0.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively, from the acquired Business Ink assets.
Restructuring and Reorganization Charges.
Restructuring and reorganization charges for the: (i) third quarter of 2018 and 2017 were $2.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $7.0 million and $4.6 million, respectively.
Operating Income.
Operating income for the: (i) third quarter of 2018 was $25.7 million, or 12.0% of total revenues, compared to $28.4 million, or 14.2% of total revenues for the third quarter of 2017; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $75.5 million, or 12.0% of total revenues, compared to $79.6 million or 13.6% of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt.
In March 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement (see Note 4 to our Financial Statements).
The effective income tax rates for the third quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



27 



The effective income tax rates for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2018 reflect the impact of the Tax Reform Act that was passed into legislation in December 2017.
During the third quarter of 2018, our estimated full-year 2018 effective income tax rate was reduced from 29% to 27% primarily due to a change in the estimate of R&D credits.
The lower effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 reflects the full year-to-date impact of this reduction.
The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 reflects: (i) an approximately $5 million net benefit resulting from Comcast’s exercise of 1.4 million vested stock warrants in January 2017, as the stock warrants appreciated in value since their vesting, resulting in an income tax benefit to us when exercised; and (ii) an approximately $2 million benefit related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718).
Liquidity  



Cash and Liquidity 



As of September 30, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $199.3 million, as compared to $186.4 million as of June 30, 2018 and $261.4 million as of as of December 31, 2017.
During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement primarily to extend the term of the loan from February 2020 to March 2023 and obtain a reduction in the interest rate and other fees.
The 2018 Credit Agreement increased our liquidity and capital resources position by approximately $30 million.
As part of our 2018 Credit Agreement, we have a $200 million senior secured revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in March 2023.
As of September 30, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding on the 2018 Revolver.
The 2018 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and financial covenants.
As of September 30, 2018, and the date of this filing, we believe that we are in compliance with the provisions of the 2018 Credit Agreement.
Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances as of the end of the indicated periods were located in the following geographical regions (in thousands):  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Our short-term investments as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $2.1 million and $139.1 million, respectively.
The significant decrease in our short-term investments between periods is due primarily to the acquisition of Business Ink in February 2018 for approximately $70 million and positioning of cash as of September 30, 2018 for the acquisition of Forte, which closed on October 1, 2018 for a purchase price of approximately $85 million (approximately $80 million, net of cash acquired), less approximately $13 million in cash subject to certain tax filings (see Note 5 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our acquisitions).
We generally have ready access to substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances, but may face limitations on moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions due to currency controls.
As of September 30, 2018, we had $3.0 million of cash restricted as to use primarily to collateralize outstanding letters of credit.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities  



We calculate our cash flows from operating activities in accordance with U.S. GAAP, beginning with net income, adding back the impact of non-cash items or non-operating activity (e.g., depreciation, amortization, amortization of OID, impairments, gain/loss from debt extinguishments, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation, etc.
), and then factoring in the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities.
See our 2017 10-K for a description of the primary uses and sources of our cash flows from operating activities.
28 



Our 2018 and 2017 net cash flows from operating activities, broken out between operations and changes in operating assets and liabilities, for the indicated quarterly periods are as follows (in thousands): 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 reflect the negative impacts of the payment of the 2017 and 2016 year-end accrued employee incentive compensation in the first quarter subsequent to the year-end accrual for these items.
Cash flows from operating activities for the second quarter of 2018 was negatively impacted primarily by the increase in the accounts receivable balance mainly related to the timing of a recurring payment from a significant client that was delayed and received subsequent to quarter-end.
Significant fluctuations in key operating assets and liabilities between 2018 and 2017 that impacted our cash flows from operating activities are as follows:  



Billed Trade Accounts Receivable 



Management of our billed accounts receivable is one of the primary factors in maintaining consistently strong quarterly cash flows from operating activities.
Our gross and net billed trade accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts receivable (“Allowance”) as of the end of the indicated quarterly periods, and the related DBOs for the quarters then ended, are as follows (in thousands, except DBOs):  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The increase in gross and net billed accounts receivable during 2018 is due to the addition of Business Ink’s accounts receivable and the timing around certain recurring client payments (from different clients) that were delayed at the end of the second and  



29 



third quarter.
As these monthly payments were received subsequent to each quarter-end, they do not raise any collectability concerns.
As of September 30, 2018, approximately 95% of our billed accounts receivable balance is less than 60 days past due.
As a global provider of software and professional services, a portion of our accounts receivable balance relates to clients outside the U.S.
This diversity in the geographic composition of our client base may adversely impact our DBOs as longer billing cycles (i.e., billing terms and cash collection cycles) are an inherent characteristic of international software and professional services transactions.
For example, our ability to bill (i.e., send an invoice) and collect arrangement fees may be dependent upon, among other things: (i) the completion of various client administrative matters, local country billing protocols and processes (including local cultural differences), and/or non-client administrative matters; (ii) us meeting certain contractual invoicing milestones; or (iii) the overall project status in certain situations in which we act as a subcontractor to another vendor on a project.
Other Current and Non-Current Assets 



Other current and non-current assets increased $10.3 million to $49.6 million as of September 30, 2018, from $39.3 million as of December 31, 2017, due primarily to the timing of payments of various prepaid items, mainly, prepaid software and hardware maintenance fees.
Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, these were included with investments in client contracts and included in investing activities.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities 



Our typical investing activities consist of purchases/sales of short-term investments and purchases of property and equipment, which are discussed below.
Additionally, as discussed earlier, during the first quarter of 2018 we acquired Business Ink for $68.6 million, net of cash acquired, and as discussed in Note 2 to our Financial Statements, made an investment in payment technology and services company for $2.8 million, which is included in our cash flows from investing activities.
Purchases/Sales of Short-term Investments.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we purchased $53.3 million and $116.2 million, respectively, and sold (or had mature) $190.5 million and $150.8 million, respectively, of short-term investments.
Software, Property and Equipment/Client Contracts.
Our capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, for software, property and equipment, and investments in client contracts were as follows (in thousands): 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Our property and equipment expenditures for these periods consisted principally of investments in: (i) statement production equipment; (ii) computer hardware, software, and related equipment; and (iii) facilities and internal infrastructure items.
As a result of the application of ASC 606, $7.3 million of investments in client contracts have been included in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, investments in client contracts were included in investing activities.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities  



Our financing activities typically consist of activities associated with our common stock and our long-term debt.
Cash Dividends Paid on Common Stock.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Board approved dividend payments totaling $21.2 million and $20.0 million, respectively.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we paid dividends of $21.2 million and $20.4 million, respectively (with the additional amounts attributed to dividends for incentive shares paid upon vesting).
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of our common stock in each period under the guidelines of our Stock Repurchase Program for $16.8 million and $15.6 million, respectively.
Long-term Debt.
During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement and as a result, we repaid the outstanding principal balance of $120.0 million and borrowed $150.0 million under the 2018 Credit Agreement, resulting in a net increase of available cash of $30.0 million.
As part of the refinancing, we paid $1.5 million of deferred financing costs.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we settled our conversion obligation for the 2010 Convertible Notes as follows: (i) we paid cash of $34.8 million for the remaining par value of the 2010 Convertible Notes; and (ii) delivered 694,240 of our common shares from treasury stock to settle the $28.8 million conversion obligation in excess of par value.
Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we made principal repayments of $3.8 million and $11.3 million, respectively.
Capital Resources  



The following are the key items to consider in assessing our sources and uses of capital resources:  



Current Sources of Capital Resources.
•  



Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments.
As of September 30, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $199.3 million, of which approximately 75% is in U.S.
Dollars and held in the U.S. We have $3.0 million of restricted cash, used primarily to collateralize outstanding letters of credit.
For the remainder of the monies denominated in foreign currencies and/or located outside the U.S., we do not anticipate any material amounts being unavailable for use in running our business.
As of September 30, 2018, we had positioned cash in preparation for the closing of the acquisition of Forte on October 1, 2018.
•  



Operating Cash Flows.
As described in the Liquidity section above, we believe we have the ability to generate strong cash flows to fund our operating activities and act as a source of funds for our capital resource needs.
•  



Long-Term Debt\Revolving Credit Facility.
In March 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement and as a result, we repaid the outstanding term loan principal balance of $120.0 million and borrowed $150.0 million, resulting in a net increase in cash of $30 million (the 2018 Credit Agreement).
The 2018 Credit Agreement also includes a $200 million revolving loan facility (2018 Revolver).
As of September 30, 2018, we had no borrowing outstanding on our 2018 Revolver and had the entire $200 million available to us.
Uses/Potential Uses of Capital Resources.
Below are the key items to consider in assessing our uses/potential uses of capital resources:  



•  



Common Stock Repurchases.
As of September 30, 2018, we had 5.8 million shares authorized for repurchase remaining under our Stock Repurchase Program.
In September 2018, we announced an increase in our planned share repurchases of up to $150 million under our Stock Repurchase Program over the next three years.
Under our Stock Repurchase Program, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including through an accelerated stock repurchase plan or under a SEC Rule 10b5-1 plan.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of our common stock for $16.9 million (weighted-average price of $42.71 per share).
•  



Cash Dividends.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Board declared dividends totaling $21.2 million.
Going forward, we expect to pay cash dividends each year in March, June, September, and December, with the amount and timing subject to the Board’s approval.
•  



Acquisitions.
In February 2018, we acquired Business Ink, a privately-held multi-channel business communications company based in Austin, Texas for approximately $70 million.
The acquisition was funded from currently available cash.
On October 1, 2018, we acquired Forte, a leading provider of advanced payment solutions headquartered in Allen, Texas for a purchase price of approximately $85 million, (approximately $80 million, net of cash acquired), and held back approximately $13 million in cash subject to certain tax filings.
The purchase agreement includes provisions for $18.8 million of potential future earn-out payments over a four-year measurement period.
The earn-out payments are tied to performance-based goals and continued employment by the eligible recipients.
The acquisition was funded from currently available cash.
•  



Equity Method Investment.
On July 30, 2018, we made an investment of $2.8 million for a 4% noncontrolling financial interest in a payment technology and services company that enables omni-channel digital payments in Latin America.
See Note 2 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion.
•  



Capital Expenditures.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we spent $44.0 million on capital expenditures.
As of September 30, 2018, we had committed to purchase approximately $9 million of equipment.
•  



Stock Warrants.
We have issued Stock Warrants with an exercise price of $26.68 per warrant to Comcast as an incentive for Comcast to convert new customer accounts to ACP.
Once vested, Comcast may exercise the Stock Warrants and elect either physical delivery of common shares or net share settlement (cashless exercise).
Alternatively, the exercise of the Stock Warrants may be settled with cash based solely on our approval, or if Comcast were to beneficially own or control in excess of 19.99% of our common stock or voting of the Company.
As of September 30, 2018, approximately 1.4 million Stock Warrants are outstanding, of which 0.4 million are vested.
The Stock Warrants are discussed in more detail in Note 10 to our Financial Statements.

Long-Term Debt.
As discussed above, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement in March 2018.
As of September 30, 2018, our long-term debt consisted of the following: (i) 2016 Convertible Notes with a par value of $230.0 million; and (ii) 2018 Credit Agreement term loan borrowings of $146.3 million.
2016 Convertible Notes 



During the next twelve months, there are no scheduled conversion triggers on our 2016 Convertible Notes.
As a result, we expect our required debt service cash outlay during the next twelve months for the 2016 Convertible Notes to be limited to interest payments of $9.8 million.
2018 Credit Agreement 



Our 2018 Credit Agreement mandatory repayments and the cash interest expense (based upon current interest rates) for the next twelve months is $7.5 million, and $6.1 million, respectively.
In summary, we expect to continue to have material needs for capital resources going forward, as noted above.
