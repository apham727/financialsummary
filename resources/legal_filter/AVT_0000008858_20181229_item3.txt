The Company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not economically hedged.
Thus, any increase or decrease in fair value of the Company’s forward foreign currency exchange contracts is generally offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged position.
For interest rate risk, the Company continues to maintain a combination of fixed and variable rate debt to mitigate the exposure to fluctuation in market interest rates.
See Liquidity and Capital Resources — Financing Transactions appearing in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of the Company’s financing transactions and capital structure.
As of December 29, 2018, 76% of the Company’s debt bears interest at a fixed rate and 24% of the Company’s debt bears interest at variable rates.
Therefore, a hypothetical 1.0% (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would result in a $1.2 million decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
