1.
Basis of Presentation



The accompanying unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included, unless otherwise disclosed.
Operating results for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018.
The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K (SEC File No.
001-32253), which was filed on May 30, 2017 (the “2017 Annual Report”).
The Company reports interim financial information for 13-week periods, except for the first quarter, which always begins on April 1, and the fourth quarter, which always ends on March 31.
The four quarters in fiscal 2018 end on July 2, 2017, October 1, 2017, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018, respectively.
The four quarters in fiscal 2017 ended on July 3, 2016, October 2, 2016, January 1, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively.
The consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and any partially owned subsidiaries that the Company has the ability to control.
All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No.
2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” providing guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
In July 2015, the FASB voted to delay the effective date for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permissible one year earlier.
The standard permits the use of either modified retrospective or full retrospective transition methods.
The Company has substantially completed an impact assessment of the potential changes from adopting ASU 2014-09.
The Company plans to apply the modified retrospective transition method.
The Company assembled an implementation work team to assess and document the accounting conclusions for the adoption of ASU 2014-09.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e.
lessees and lessors).
This update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee.
This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.
The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.
This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740)”: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory.
ASU 2016-16 requires that an entity recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
This update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods.
The Company early adopted the standard on a modified retrospective basis during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings of $137, as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 



9

15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
The guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those years.
Early adoption is permitted in any interim period or fiscal year before the effective date.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments



Recurring Fair Value Measurements



The following tables represent the financial assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, and the basis for that measurement:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The fair values of lead forward contracts are calculated using observable prices for lead as quoted on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) and, therefore, were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in its 2017 Annual Report.
The fair values for foreign currency forward contracts are based upon current quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2 based on the nature of the underlying market in which these derivatives are traded.
Financial Instruments



The fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to their short maturities.
The fair value of the Company’s short-term debt and borrowings under the new 2017 Credit Facility and the previous 2011 Credit Facility (each as defined in Note 9), approximate their respective carrying value, as they are variable rate debt and the terms are comparable to market terms as of the balance sheet dates and are classified as Level 2.
10

The Company's 5.00% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”), with an original face value of $300,000, were issued in April 2015.
The fair value of these Notes represent the trading values based upon quoted market prices and are classified as Level 2.
The Notes were trading at approximately 104% and 101% of face value on December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively.
The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships



Lead Forward Contracts



The Company enters into lead forward contracts to fix the price for a portion of its lead purchases.
Management considers the lead forward contracts to be effective against changes in the cash flows of the underlying lead purchases.
The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year.
At December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company has hedged the price to purchase approximately 54.0 million pounds and 45.0 million pounds of lead, respectively, for a total purchase price of $60,849 and $46,550, respectively.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of the Company’s foreign currency exposures for lead, as well as other foreign currency exposures so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the underlying foreign currency denominated exposures.
The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year.
As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company had entered into a total of $52,801 and $30,751, respectively, of such contracts.
In the coming twelve months, the Company anticipates that $3,133 of pretax gain relating to lead and foreign currency forward contracts will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) as part of cost of goods sold.
Derivatives not Designated in Hedging Relationships



Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany loans and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables.
As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the notional amount of these contracts was $24,132 and $13,560, respectively.

The tax provision for the third quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017 was based on the estimated effective tax rates applicable for the full years ending March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively, after giving effect to items specifically related to the interim periods.
The rate change is administratively effective at the beginning of the Company's fiscal year, using a blended rate for the annual period.
These amounts are considered provisional and may be affected by future guidance if and when issued.
The provisional amount recorded, related to the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax balance was a tax benefit of $14,706.
In all cases, the Company may adjust these provisional amounts which could potentially affect the measurement and impact on tax expense as the Company refines its calculations within a reasonable period not to exceed one year from the enactment date.
The consolidated effective income tax rates for the third quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017 were 141.2% and 26.7%, respectively, and for the nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017 were 63.2% and 25.7%, respectively.
Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be 64% for fiscal 2018 compared to 60% for fiscal 2017.

7.
These actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of environmental, anticompetition, employment, contract and other laws.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations, and threatened legal actions and proceedings.
European Competition Investigations 



Certain of the Company’s European subsidiaries had received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews from, and have had on-site inspections conducted by, the competition authorities of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands relating to conduct and anticompetitive practices of certain industrial battery participants.
The Company settled the Belgian regulatory proceeding in February 2016 by acknowledging certain anticompetitive practices and conduct and agreeing to pay a fine of $1,962, which was paid in March 2016.
As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company had a reserve balance of $2,058 and $1,830, respectively, relating to certain ancillary matters associated with the Belgian regulatory proceeding.
The change in the reserve balance between December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017 was solely due to foreign currency translation impact.
In June 2017, the Company settled a portion of its previously disclosed proceeding involving the German competition authority relating to conduct involving the Company's motive power battery business and agreed to pay a fine of $14,811, which was paid in July 2017.
As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 and $13,463, respectively, relating to this matter.
Also in June 2017, the German competition authority issued a fining decision related to the Company's reserve power battery business, which constitutes the remaining portion of the previously disclosed German proceeding.
The Company is appealing this decision, including payment of the proposed fine of $11,415, and believes that the reserve power matter does not, based on current facts and circumstances known to management, require an accrual.
The Company is not required to escrow any portion of this fine during the appeal process.
In July 2017, the Company settled the Dutch regulatory proceeding and agreed to pay a fine of $11,229, which was paid in August 2017.
As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company had a reserve balance of $0 and $10,258, respectively, relating to the Dutch regulatory proceeding.
As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, the Company had a total reserve balance of $2,058 and $25,551, respectively, in connection with these investigations and other related legal matters, included in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.
The foregoing estimate of losses is based upon currently available information for these proceedings.
Environmental Issues



As a result of its operations, the Company is subject to various federal, state, and local, as well as international environmental laws and regulations and is exposed to the costs and risks of registering, handling, processing, storing, transporting, and disposing of hazardous substances, especially lead and acid.
The Company’s operations are also subject to federal, state, local and international occupational safety and health regulations, including laws and regulations relating to exposure to lead in the workplace.
The Company is responsible for certain cleanup obligations at the former Yuasa battery facility in Sumter, South Carolina, that predates its ownership of this facility.
This manufacturing facility was closed in 2001 and the Company established a reserve for this facility, which was $1,117 and $1,123 as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.
Based on current information, the Company’s management believes this reserve is adequate to satisfy the Company’s environmental liabilities at this facility.
This facility is separate from the Company’s current metal fabrication facility in Sumter.
Lead and Foreign Currency Forward Contracts



To stabilize its lead costs and reduce volatility from currency movements, the Company enters into contracts with financial institutions.
The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year.
Please refer to Note 4 - Derivative Financial Instruments for more details.

The following demonstrates the change in the number of shares of common stock outstanding during the nine months ended December 31, 2017:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Accelerated Share Repurchase



During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”) with a major financial institution to repurchase up to $100,000 of its common stock.
The Company prepaid $100,000 and received an initial delivery of 1,278,976 shares with a fair market value of approximately $80,000.
The ASR is accounted for as a treasury stock repurchase, reducing the weighted average number of basic and diluted shares outstanding by the 1,278,976 shares initially received, and as a forward contract indexed to the Company's own common shares to reflect the future settlement provisions.
Because the maximum repurchase will be $100,000, as of December 31, 2017, $20,000 representing the difference between the fair value of shares delivered and the maximum notional amount of $100,000, is accounted for as an equity instrument and is included in additional paid-in capital.
The ASR is not accounted for as a derivative instrument.
No shares were received pursuant to the ASR during the current quarter.
On January 9, 2018, the ASR was settled, and the Company received an additional 216,738 shares.
See Note 15 - Subsequent Events, for more information.
