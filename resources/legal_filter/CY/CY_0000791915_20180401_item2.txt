Revenues
Our total revenues increased by $50.4 million, or 9.5%, to $582.2 million for the three-month period ended April 1, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by strength in the memory products.
Revenues recorded by MPD increased by $31.6 million, or 14.7%, in the three months ended April 1, 2018 compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to $28.5 million of revenue growth from the Flash memory products. The overall ASP of our products for MPD for the three months ended April 1, 2018 was $1.64, which increased by $0.38, compared with the same prior year period. The increase is primarily attributed to higher ASPs for Flash memory products and changes in product mix.
Our gross margin improved to 36.5% in the three months ended April 1, 2018 from 29.5% in the three months ended April 2, 2017. One of the primary drivers of the improvement in gross margin was higher fab utilization which increased from 63% in the three months ended April 2, 2017 to 74% in the three months ended April 1, 2018 and a reduction in the cost of certain products. Favorable pricing and a shift to higher margin business also contributed to the gross margin improvement. Additionally, there was a reduction in write-downs of carrying value of inventory during the three months ended April 1, 2018 as compared to the same prior year period. Write-down of inventories during the three months ended April 1, 2018 was $7.0 million as compared to $10.5 million in the three months ended April 2, 2017. Write-down of inventories unfavorably impacted our gross margin by 1.2% and 2.0% for the three months ended April 1, 2018 and April 2, 2017, respectively. Sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down aggregated to $9.0 million and $7.6 million for the first quarters of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, which favorably impacted our gross margin by 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. Included in the cost of revenues are restructuring charges of $1.9 million and $0.2 million for the first quarters of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively. During first quarter of 2018, we initiated the 2018 Plan restructuring plan which will contribute towards increasing longer term operational efficiency. The 2018 plan will result in a reduction of approximately 75 positions, which is expected to favorably impact costs starting second half of 2018. Included in the cost of revenues are amortization of intangible assets of $48.1 million and $43.2 million for the first quarters of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively.
