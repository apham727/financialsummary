Refer to Note 2 (Merger Agreement) of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report for a description of our pending acquisition by Infineon Technologies AG ("Infineon").
Memory Products Division  MPD focuses on fail-safe storage and datalogging solutions for mission critical applications. The portfolio includes specialized, high-performance parallel and serial NOR flash memories, static random access memories ("SRAM"), F-RAM™ ferroelectric memory devices, nonvolatile SRAMs ("nvSRAM"), and other specialty memories. This division also includes our nonvolatile DIMM subsidiary AgigA Tech, Inc.
Refer to Part I, Item 1 (Business) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2018 for a discussion of our strategies.
Our total revenue decreased by $91.9 million, or 14.7%, to $532.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Revenue from the NAND flash business which was divested on April 1, 2019 was $49.5 million in the three months ended July 1, 2018. Excluding the impact of the NAND flash business divestiture, our total revenues decreased by $42.4 million, or 7.4%, to $532.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to demand softening across our NOR flash, microcontroller and wireless connectivity businesses.
Our total revenues decreased by $135.1 million, or 11.2%, to $1,071.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was attributable in part to the divestiture of our NAND flash business, which was completed on April 1, 2019. Revenue from the NAND flash business decreased by $63.4 million to $31.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. The remainder of the decrease was primarily due to demand softening across our NOR flash, microcontroller and wireless connectivity businesses.
Revenues recorded by MCD decreased by $40.6 million, or 5.8%, in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in demand for microcontroller and wireless connectivity products. 
Revenues recorded by MPD decreased by $77.6 million, or 30.4%, in the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of our NAND flash business, which was completed on April 1, 2019, and due to a decline in revenue from NOR flash products. Revenue from the divested NAND flash business was $49.5 million in the three months ended July 1, 2018. 
Revenues recorded by MPD decreased by $94.5 million, or 18.9%, in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in demand for NAND flash and NOR flash products, and the divestiture of our NAND flash business, which was completed on April 1, 2019. Revenue from the NAND flash business decreased by $63.4 million to $31.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.
Our gross margin decreased to 37.3% in the three months ended June 30, 2019 from 37.5% in the three months ended July 1, 2018. A primary driver was the decrease in revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period a year ago causing an increase in amortization expense from intangible assets as a percentage of revenue. Amortization of intangible assets included in cost of revenue was $46.9 million or 8.8% of revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $48.1 million or 7.7% of revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down decreased in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period a year ago. Gross margins in the second quarters of fiscal 2019 and 2018 benefited 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively, from the sale of previously reserved inventory. The above unfavorable items impacting gross margin were partially offset by certain items which improved gross margin recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to same period in 2018. These favorable items included a shift in the product mix towards higher density memory products, a decrease in sales of commoditized products, and a reduction in the cost of certain products. 
Our gross margin improved to 37.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2019 from 37.0% in the six months ended July 1, 2018. 
The primary drivers of the improvement in gross margin were a shift in the product mix towards higher density memory products, a decrease in sales of commoditized products, which was due in part to the divestiture of the NAND business effective the second quarter of fiscal 2019, and a reduction in the cost of certain products. This improvement was partially offset by a decrease in the sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down for the six months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the same prior year period. Gross margins in the six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018 benefited 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively, from the sale of previously reserved inventory. Included in cost of revenues are amortization of intangible assets of $93.8 million and $96.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and July 1, 2018, respectively.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded a $29.5 million impairment charge for the equity-method investment in Deca Technologies, Inc. ("Deca"). The carrying value of our investment in Deca was $28.6 million and $65.1 million as of June 30, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively. There continues to be a substantial risk that the carrying value of this investment may be further impaired in the future as described in Note 7 (Equity-Method Investments) of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report. Deca will likely need to secure additional funding to support its growth and cash needs. Failure to secure such funding will impact its ability to continue as a going concern. 
Our Revolving Credit Facility had a capacity of $540 million which was undrawn as of June 30, 2019.
On July 31, 2019, we amended our existing Revolving Credit Facility thereby increasing the available amount from $540 million to $700 million and extending its maturity from March 12, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We may, at our sole discretion, extend the maturity for another six months to July 31, 2021. The financial covenants were amended to increase the maximum total leverage ratio from 3.75 to 4.0. We borrowed $447 million under the amended Revolving Credit Facility and repaid the entire outstanding Term Loan B principal balance of approximately $448 million as of July 31, 2019, resulting in extinguishment of Term Loan B, which was otherwise scheduled to mature on July 5, 2021.
•stock-based compensation expense of $50.9 million;
•impairment of investment in Deca of $29.5 million;
•accretion of interest expense on senior exchangeable notes and amortization of debt and financing costs on other debt of $9.4 million; 
•restructuring costs and other adjustments of $4.0 million; and 
•loss related to assets held for sale of $3.5 million.
•$53.8 million in operating lease right-of-use assets recorded upon adoption of ASC 842, partially offset by $50.2 million of operating lease liability;
•an increase in inventories of $38.4 million primarily due to inventory builds to support certain supplier transitions;
•property and equipment expenditures of $18.0 million relating to purchases of certain manufacturing facility equipment; and
•partially offset by 6.3 million in net distributions for the deferred compensation plan; and 
•proceeds of $2.9 million from the sale of inventories to SkyHigh.
•payments of $6.1 million on net shares settlement of restricted stock units; and
•payments of $0.8 million on finance lease liabilities;
•partially offset by proceeds of $31.9 million from employee equity awards. 
As discussed in Note 1, we adopted ASC Topic 842 on December 31, 2018. There have been no other changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2018.
