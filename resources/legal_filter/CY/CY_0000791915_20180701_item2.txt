Revenues
Our total revenues increased by $30.3 million, or 5.1%, to $624.1 million for the three-month period ended July 1, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by strength in wired and wireless connectivity, microcontrollers, and memory products.
Our total revenues increased by $80.7 million, or 7.2%, to $1,206.3 million for the six-month period ended July 1, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by strength in wired and wireless connectivity, microcontrollers, and memory products.
Revenues recorded by MCD increased by $8.0 million, or 2.2%, in the three months ended July 1, 2018 compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by the growth in wired and wireless connectivity and microcontroller products. The overall average selling price ("ASP") of our products for MCD for the three months ended July 1, 2018 was $1.02 which decreased by $0.04, compared with the same prior year period primarily due to changes in product mix.
Revenues recorded by MCD increased by $26.8 million, or 4.0%, in the six months ended July 1, 2018 compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by growth in the wired and wireless connectivity and microcontroller products. The overall ASP of our products for MCD for the six months ended July 1, 2018 was $1.02 which decreased by $0.07, compared with the same prior year period primarily due to changes in product mix.
Revenues recorded by MPD increased by $22.3 million, or 9.6%, in the three months ended July 1, 2018 compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to growth in revenue from Flash memory products. The overall ASP of our products for MPD for the three months ended July 1, 2018 was $1.65, which increased by $0.35, compared with the same prior year period. The increase is primarily attributed to higher ASPs for Flash memory products and changes in product mix.
Revenues recorded by MPD increased by $53.9 million, or 12.1%, in the six months ended July 1, 2018 compared to the same prior year period. The increase was primarily due to growth in revenue from the Flash memory products. The overall ASP of our products for MPD for the six months ended July 1, 2018 was $1.64, which increased by $0.36, compared with the same prior year period. The increase is primarily attributed to higher ASPs for Flash memory products and changes in product mix.
Our gross margin improved to 37.5% in the three months ended July 1, 2018 from 32.5% in the three months ended July 2, 2017. The primary drivers of the improvement in gross margin were an increase in selling prices, higher fab utilization, which increased from 74.6% in the three months ended July 2, 2017 to 82.9% in the three months ended July 1, 2018, and a reduction in the cost of certain products. Additionally, there was a reduction in write-downs of carrying value of inventory during the three months ended July 1, 2018 as compared to the same prior year period. Write-down of inventories during the three months ended July 1, 2018 was $6.8 million as compared to $9.0 million in the three months ended July 2, 2017. Write-down of inventories unfavorably impacted our gross margin by 1.1% and 1.5% for the three months ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017, respectively. Sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down aggregated to $7.6 million and $11.3 million for the second quarters of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, which favorably impacted our gross margin by 1.2% and 1.9%, respectively. Included in the cost of revenues are restructuring costs of $1.6 million for the three months ended July 1, 2018. There was no restructuring cost for the three months ended July 2, 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, we initiated the 2018 Plan which will contribute towards increasing longer term operational efficiency. The 2018 Plan will result in a reduction of approximately 75 positions, which is expected to favorably impact costs in the second half of 2018. Included in the cost of revenues are amortization of intangible assets of $48.1 million and $44.3 million for the second quarters of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our gross margin improved to 37.0% in the six months ended July 1, 2018 from 31.1% in the six months ended July 2, 2017. The primary drivers of the improvement in gross margin were an increase in selling prices, higher fab utilization, which increased from 68.9% in the six months ended July 2, 2017 to 78.7% in the six months ended July 1, 2018, and a reduction in the cost of certain products. Additionally, there was a reduction in write-downs of carrying value of inventory during the six months ended July 1, 2018 as compared to the same prior year period. Write-down of inventories during the six months ended July 1, 2018 was $11.9 million as compared to $19.1 million in the six months ended July 2, 2017.

During the first quarter of 2018, we initiated the 2018 Plan restructuring plan which will contribute towards increasing longer term operational efficiency. The 2018 Plan will result in a reduction of approximately 75 positions, which is expected to favorably impact costs starting in the second half of 2018. Included in the cost of revenues is the amortization of intangible assets of $96.2 million and $87.4 million for the six months ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017, respectively.

Liquidity and Contractual Obligations
In December 2017, we entered into fixed-for-floating interest rate forward swap agreements with two counterparties, to swap variable interest payments on certain debt for fixed interest payments; these agreements will expire in July 2021. The objective of the swap was to effectively fix the interest rate at current levels without having to refinance the outstanding term loan, thereby avoiding the incurrence of transaction costs. The interest rate on the variable debt was fixed in December 2017 and became effective in April 2018; if interest rates at the time of the scheduled periodic payments are below this fixed rate, we will pay the difference between the fixed and actual rates. 
Capital Resources and Financial Condition
Our long-term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest-bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and debt securities, payments of regularly scheduled cash dividends, repayment of debt, and share repurchases. As of July 1, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balance was $112.7 million as compared to $151.6 million as of December 31, 2017. As of July 1, 2018, approximately 30.5% of our cash was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. While these amounts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, a portion is denominated in foreign currencies. All non-U.S. cash balances are exposed to local political, banking, currency control, and other risks. In addition, these amounts, if repatriated, may be subject to tax and other transfer restrictions.
