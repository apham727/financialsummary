Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "Cypress" or the "Company") reports on a fiscal-year basis. The Company ends its quarters on the Sunday closest to the end of the applicable calendar quarter, except in a 53-week fiscal year, in which case the additional week falls into the fourth quarter of that fiscal year. Fiscal years 2018 and 2017 each contain(ed) 52 weeks. The third quarter of fiscal 2018 ended on September 30, 2018 and the third quarter of fiscal 2017 ended on October 1, 2017.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and include the accounts of Cypress Semiconductor Corporation and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The Company has developed a project plan to facilitate the implementation of ASU 2016-02. The Company continues to make progress on this plan which includes reaching out to the Company’s businesses, as well as assessing the Company’s portfolio of active leases. The Company has also selected a lease accounting software solution to support the new reporting requirements and continues to make progress on its configuration and assessing the design of the future lease process.
While the Company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact the new lease accounting guidance will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company expects to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for its operating leases, which will have a material impact on the Consolidated Balance Sheet upon adoption. The Company does not expect the changes to have a material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Upon adoption, the Company expects that its financial statement disclosures will be expanded to present additional details of its leasing arrangements. The Company is currently evaluating internal controls that would be impacted by the new guidance, to ensure readiness for adoption in the first fiscal quarter of 2019.
In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU on revenue from contracts with customers, ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)." This standard update outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Collectively, we refer to ASU No. 2014-09, its related amendments, and Subtopic 340-40 as "Topic 606."
On January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to all contracts that are not completed contracts at the date of initial application (i.e., January 1, 2018). Results for reporting periods after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under Topic 605. There was no impact on the opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2018 due to the adoption of Topic 606. We reclassified the sales return reserve to current liabilities presented as "Price adjustment and other revenue reserves" from the allowance for accounts receivable due to the adoption of Topic 606. 
We then select an appropriate method for measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, usually costs incurred to date relative to the total expected costs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation.
Our non-recurring engineering ("NRE") contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For NRE arrangements, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally 
determine the standalone selling price of intellectual property licenses based on the residual approach, and service based on cost plus a reasonable margin. We recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice, if the right to consideration from the customer is in an amount that corresponds reasonably with the value to the customer of the entity’s performance completed to date.
We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. 
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, "Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory." For public entities, ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Company identified and recorded certain immaterial errors that originated in fiscal years ended January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016. These errors consisted primarily of errors in certain assumptions and calculations used in the determination of non-cash stock-based compensation primarily relating to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). The Company determined that the errors were not material to the previously issued financial statements and disclosures included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 or for any quarterly periods included therein.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company is presenting comparative fiscal 2017 quarterly information. The fiscal 2017 results for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2017 have been revised to reflect the quarterly impact of the adjustments described above.
On August 14, 2018, the Company acquired an embedded software company focused on the internet of things (or "IoT") market for cash consideration of $3 million. The purchase consideration was allocated to acquired developed technology. Pro forma results of operations of the acquired company have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material.
Privately-held equity investments in entities the Company does not control are accounted for under the equity method of accounting if the Company has an ownership interest of 20% or greater or if it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of such companies. 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company determined that its investment in Enovix, which is accounted for as an equity method investment, had suffered an other-than temporary impairment primarily because Enovix had not achieved certain key planned product development milestones. Consequently, the Company recognized a charge of $51.2 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, reducing its carrying value to zero as of December 31, 2017. The Company held 27.9% of Enovix's outstanding voting shares as of September 30, 2018. 
The estimated fair value of the Company’s investment in Deca approximates carrying value of the Company’s investment in Deca as of September 30, 2018. Deca continues to be in the process of developing and testing a fan-out wafer level packaging technology. Deca’s estimated enterprise value is sensitive to its ability to achieve these product development and testing milestones. Delays or failure by Deca to complete these milestones, or secure funding needed to support the company’s growth and cash needs, may have a significant adverse impact on Deca’s estimated enterprise value and may result in the recognition of a material impairment in the carrying value of the Company’s investment in Deca.
The Company held 52.5% of Deca's outstanding voting shares as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The Company's investment in Deca is accounted for as an equity method investment. 
The below table presents the changes in carrying value of the equity method investment related to Deca.
The following table presents summarized aggregate financial information derived from the respective consolidated financial statements of Deca for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and of Deca and Enovix for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2017.
The following table represents the assets and liabilities held by Deca as of September 30, 2018, and by Deca and Enovix as of December 31, 2017.
The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 
Certain of the Company’s assets, including intangible assets, goodwill and cost-method investments, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis if impairment is indicated.

Additionally as part of the 2018 Plan, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company increased the reduction in workforce by approximately 50 positions across various functions. The restructuring costs of $0.2 million and $3.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, consist of personnel costs. The Company anticipates that the remaining restructuring accrual balance of $1.0 million will be paid out in cash through the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
In December 2017, the Company began implementation of a reduction in workforce (the "2017 Plan") which resulted in the elimination of approximately 80 positions worldwide across various functions. A restructuring cost of $2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, consists of personnel costs. The Company anticipates that the remaining restructuring accrual balance of $30 thousand will be paid out in cash through the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
In September 2016, the Company began the implementation of a reduction in workforce (the "2016 Plan") which resulted in the elimination of approximately 430 positions worldwide across various functions. No restructuring cost was recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 related to the 2016 Plan. There was no restructuring cost related to the 2016 Plan during the three months ended October 1, 2017. The restructuring cost of $3.4 million recorded for the nine months ended October 1, 2017 consists of personnel costs of $1.8 million, and other charges related to the write-off of certain licenses and facilities-related expenses of $1.6 million. The Company had paid out the remaining restructuring cost of $0.5 million, which consisted of personnel costs, by July 1, 2018.
In March 2015, the Company implemented cost reduction and restructuring activities in connection with the Merger. As part of this restructuring plan, the Company exited an office space leased by Spansion and had recorded a reserve related to excess lease obligation for the building. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company began negotiating a termination agreement with the building’s owner and, consequently, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded $9.8 million of additional restructuring reserve based on estimated termination costs.
The Company anticipates that the remaining restructuring accrual balance of $19.0 million, which is recorded as part of Other Current Liabilities in the Condensed Balance Sheet, will be paid out in cash through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

On March 12, 2018, the Company amended its Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement, which governs the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The amendment reduces the applicable margins on the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan B. After giving effect to the amendment, the Term Loan B bore interest, at the option of the Company, at the base rate plus an applicable margin of 1.25% or the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of 2.25%; and the Revolving Credit Facility bears interest, at the option of the Company, at the base rate plus an applicable margin of either 0.75% or 1.00%, depending on the Company's secured leverage ratio, or the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75% or 2.00%, depending on the Company's secured leverage ratio.

On September 13, 2018, the Company again amended its Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement. The amendment reduces the applicable margin for Term Loan B. After giving effect to the amendment, Term Loan B will bear interest, at the option of the Company, at the base rate plus an applicable margin of 1.00% or the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of 2.00%. As part of the transaction the Company repaid $25.0 million of outstanding Term Loan B principal.
On March 7, 2018, the Company entered into a privately negotiated agreement to induce the extinguishment of $10 million of the remaining $22 million of Spansion Notes outstanding. The Company paid the holders of the Spansion Notes cash for the aggregate principal of $10 million and delivered 1.4 million shares of common stock for the conversion spread. The Company 
recorded $0.2 million in loss on extinguishment and a reduction in additional paid-in capital of $25.7 million towards the deemed repurchase of the equity component of the notes. The loss on extinguishment is recorded in "Interest Expense" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Additionally, the Company had certain capital lease arrangements related to certain equipment at its Austin manufacturing facility. As of September 30, 2018, the Company recorded a capital lease obligation of approximately $9.4 million. 
The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through fiscal 2022 and thereafter. Some leases include renewal options, which would permit extensions of the expiration dates at rates approximating fair market rental values at the time of the extension.
Restructuring accrual balances related to operating facility leases were $19.0 million and $11.5 million as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
The Company generally warrants its products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year, and that product warranty is generally limited to a refund of the original purchase price of the product or a replacement part. The Company estimates its warranty costs based upon its historical warranty claim experience. Warranty returns are recorded as an allowance for sales returns. The allowance for sales returns is reviewed quarterly to verify that it reflects the remaining obligations based on the anticipated returns over the balance of the obligation period.
The Company has entered into agreements with certain vendors that include "take or pay" terms. Take or pay terms obligate the Company to purchase a minimum required amount of materials or services or make specified payments in lieu of such purchase. The Company may not be able to consume minimum commitments under these take or pay terms, requiring payments to vendors, which may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s earnings.
On August 15, 2016, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed by the California Institute of Technology ("Caltech") against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (Case No. 16-cv-03714). The other co-defendants are Apple Inc., Avago Technologies Limited, Broadcom Corporation, and Broadcom Limited. Caltech alleged that defendants infringe four patents. On September 7, 2018, the claims against the Company were dismissed with prejudice and, accordingly, this matter is considered closed.
In addition, the Company is currently involved in various other legal proceedings, claims, and disputes arising in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property claims and other matters. 
The Company enters into multiple foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risk resulting from fluctuations in Japanese yen (¥) and Euro (€) exchange rates. In addition, the Company entered into fixed-for-interest rate forward swap agreements and has designated these swaps as hedging instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative securities for speculative purposes. The Company’s hedging policy is designed to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its operating results. Some foreign currency forward contracts are considered to be economic hedges that were not designated as hedging instruments while others were designated as cash flow hedges. Whether designated or undesignated as cash flow hedges or not, these forward contracts protect the Company against the variability of forecasted 
foreign currency cash flows resulting from revenues, expenses and net asset or liability positions designated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The maximum original duration of any contract allowable under the Company’s hedging policy is thirteen months for foreign currency hedging contracts.
The Company enters into cash flow hedges to protect non-functional currency inventory purchases and certain other operational expenses, in addition to its ongoing program of cash flow hedges to protect its non-functional currency revenues against variability in cash flows due to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges have maturities between three and thirteen months. All hedging relationships are formally documented, and the hedges are designed to offset changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions at the inception of the hedge. The Company recognizes derivative instruments from hedging activities as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures them at fair value on a monthly basis. The Company records changes in the intrinsic value of its cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. Interest charges or "forward points" on the forward contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recorded in interest and other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company entered into cash flow hedges, in which interest charges or "forward points" on the forward contracts are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness, and are recorded in the underlying hedged items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. When the forecasted transaction occurs, the Company reclassifies the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue or costs, depending on the risk hedged. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the Company will reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations at that time. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company had a loss of $1.7 million, which was related to cash flow hedges, recorded in other comprehensive income.
The Company evaluates hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively and records any ineffective portion of the hedge in interest and other income, net in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
On January 3, 2018, the Company evaluated the hedge effectiveness of the interest rate swaps and designated these swaps as hedging instruments. Upon designation as cash flow hedge instruments, future changes in fair value of these swaps are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company has recognized a gain of $5.9 million, which was recorded in other comprehensive income. 
The effect of derivative instruments on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was not material.
For the three months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, approximately 2.8 million and 0.8 million weighted average potentially dilutive shares underlying outstanding stock-based awards and convertible debt, respectively, were excluded in the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, approximately 2.7 million and 26.0 million weighted average potentially dilutive shares underlying outstanding stock-based awards and convertible debt, respectively, were excluded in the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
The Company's income tax expense was $5.6 million and $4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively. The income tax expense was $15.8 million and $13.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, and October 1, 2017, respectively. Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily attributable to non-U.S. taxes associated with the Company's non-U.S. operations. 
Management regularly evaluates the realizability of the Company's net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence, both positive and negative. The realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax attributes to fully utilize these assets. The Company weighed both positive and negative evidence and determined that there is a continued need for a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets in the United States as of September 30, 2018. The Company intends to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. However, considering the Company's current assessment of the probability of maintaining profitability, there is a reasonable possibility that, within the next 12 months, sufficient positive evidence may become available to reach a conclusion that a significant portion, or all, of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. As such, the Company may release a significant portion, or all, of its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets within the next 12 months. This release, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material decrease to income tax expense for the period such release is recorded.
As of September 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate totaled $30.8 million and $28.9 million, respectively.
•completion of examinations by, and resolution of agreements with, U.S. or foreign taxing authorities; and
The Company classifies interest and penalties as components of the income tax provision in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the amounts of accrued interest and penalties totaled $12.3 million and $11.0 million, respectively.
The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of solutions for embedded systems, from automotive, industrial, consumer electronics, and medical products. 
Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker ("CODM"), or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. The CODM is considered to be the Chief Executive Officer. 
The Company's segments are its Microcontroller and Connectivity Division (or MCD) and its Memory Products Division (or MPD). 
The Company tracks its assets by physical location. Although management reviews asset information on a corporate level and allocates depreciation expense by segment, the Company’s CODM does not review asset information on a segment basis.
Outstanding accounts receivable from two of the Company's distributors accounted for 21.7% and 16.4% of its consolidated accounts receivable as of September 30, 2018. Outstanding accounts receivable from one of the Company's distributors accounted for 28.0% of its consolidated accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017.
Revenue from sales to two of the Company's distributors accounted for 17.7% and 15.1% of its consolidated revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2018. Revenue from sales to two of the Company's distributors accounted for 18.6% and 13.8% of its consolidated revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. No other distributors or customers accounted for 10% or more of the Company's consolidated revenues for the three months or nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Revenue from sales to one of the Company’s distributors accounted for 16.0% of its consolidated revenues for the three months ended October 1, 2017. Revenue from sales to one of the Company’s distributors accounted for 16.4% of its consolidated revenues for the nine months ended October 1, 2017. No other distributors or customers accounted for 10% or more of the Company's consolidated revenues for the three months or nine months ended October 1, 2017.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company purchases from, or sells to (a) entities for which one of the Company's directors or executive officers serves as a director or (b) entities that are otherwise affiliated with one of the Company's directors or executive officers (collectively, "related parties").
As of September 30, 2018, and October 1, 2017, balances receivable from related parties totaled $65.0 thousand and $4.5 million, respectively, and balances payable to related parties totaled $2.0 million and $9.1 million, respectively.
On October 20, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") authorized a $450 million stock buyback program. The program allows the Company to purchase its common stock or enter into equity derivative transactions related to its common stock. The timing and actual amount expended with the authorized funds will depend on a variety of factors including the 
market price of the common stock, regulatory, legal, and contractual requirements, other uses of cash, and other market factors. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and may be modified or suspended at any time at the discretion of the Board. During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 598 thousand shares for an aggregate consideration of $10.0 million. As of September 30, 2018 the total remaining dollar amount of shares that may be repurchased under the program was approximately $190.8 million.
On August 3, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.11 per share payable to holders of record of its common stock at the close of the business day on September 27, 2018. This cash dividend was paid on October 18, 2018 and totaled approximately $39.8 million which was accrued for and shown as "Dividends payable" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2018.
In October 2018, the Company entered into fixed-for-floating interest rate forward swap agreements starting in July 2021 with two counterparties to swap variable interest payments on expected future debt for fixed interest payments; these agreements will expire in December 2024. The objective of the swaps was to effectively fix the future interest rate at the level currently available to avoid the uncertainty in financing cost for a portion of debt due to future interest rate fluctuations. The aggregate notional amount of these interest rate swaps was $300 million. The Company has evaluated the hedge effectiveness of the interest rate swaps and has designated these swaps as cash flow hedges of the debt with future changes in fair value of these swaps recognized in the accumulated other comprehensive income.
On October 23, 2018, the Company entered into a joint venture arrangement (JV) with SK hynix system ic Inc. Upon close of the transaction, the Company will contribute $2.4 million in cash and will transfer its NAND Flash business to the JV. The Company will own 40% of the JV’s common stock. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, subject to applicable regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The NAND business is presently reported as part of the MPD segment. The Company recorded $43.3 million and $137.9 million in revenue from the NAND business during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively; and $41.6 million and $119.7 million during the three and nine months ended October 1, 2017, respectively.

•inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
For example, our sales were impacted in the second quarter of 2018 when the U.S. Department of Commerce banned U.S. companies from providing exports to ZTE, a Chinese telecoms equipment manufacturer (which ban was subsequently lifted in the third quarter of 2018) in an export controls case. Similarly, general trade tensions between the U.S. and China have been escalating in 2018, with rounds of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods taking effect in July, August, and September 2018 (some of which prompted retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods) and with an additional U.S. tariff rate increase scheduled to take effect in January 2019. Further rounds of tariffs have also been threatened by U.S. and Chinese leaders.
•The August and September 2018 rounds of U.S. tariffs apply to some of our products that are assembled in China and imported to the U.S. Specifically, the August round imposed a 25% tariff on integrated circuits and the September round imposed a 10% tariff on modules, which will rise to 25% in January 2019. For the third quarter of 2018 (when the tariffs were imposed late in the quarter) an immaterial amount of our revenue arose from products subject to such tariffs. Assuming these tariffs remain in effect, we currently project that products subject to the tariffs will generate 
While many of our products are assembled, packaged and tested at our manufacturing facilities located in the Philippines and Thailand, we rely on independent subcontractors to assemble, package and test the balance of our products. We cannot be certain that these subcontractors will continue to assemble, package and test products for us on acceptable economic and quality terms or at all and it might be difficult for us to find alternatives if they do not do so.
