Interest Rate Risks
Our investment portfolio consists of a variety of financial instruments that expose us to interest rate risk, including, but not limited to, money market funds, and certificates of deposit. Due to the relatively short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe that an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio.
Our debt obligations consist of a variety of financial instruments that expose us to interest rate risk, including, but not limited to our Revolving Credit Facility and exchangeable notes. Interest on the exchangeable notes is fixed and interest on our Revolving Credit Facility is tied to short-term interest rate benchmarks including the prime rate and the London inter-bank offered rate, or LIBOR.
