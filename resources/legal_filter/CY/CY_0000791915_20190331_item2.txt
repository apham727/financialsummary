Revenues
Revenues recorded by MPD decreased by $16.9 million, or 6.9%, in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in demand for NAND Flash products. 
Our gross margin improved to 37.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from 36.5% in the three months ended April 1, 2018. The primary drivers of the improvement in gross margin were a shift in the product mix towards higher density memory products and a decrease in commoditized products, higher fab utilization, which increased from 74% in the three months ended April 1, 2018 to 83% in the three months ended March 31, 2019, and a reduction in the cost of certain products. This improvement was partially offset by a decrease in the sale of inventory that was previously written off or written down for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to the same prior year period. The gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 was benefited by 0.7% and 1.6%, respectively, from the sale of previously reserved inventory. Included in cost of revenues are amortization of intangible assets of $46.9 million and $48.1 million for the first quarters of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.
