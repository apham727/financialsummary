Item 2. 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
The following table provides the companys (non-GAAP) operating earnings for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017. 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
Strategic imperatives revenue of $9.0 billion increased 15 percent as reported and 10 percent adjusted for currency in the first quarter, with double-digit growth in cloud, security and mobile, as the company continues to build new platforms and solutions and embeds cloud and AI capabilities across the business. Strategic imperatives revenue over the last 12 months was $37.7 billion, an increase of 12 percent as reported and 10 percent adjusted for currency, representing 47 percent of the companys total revenue. Total Cloud revenue in the first quarter of 2018 of $4.2 billion increased 20 percent as reported and 14 percent adjusted for currency, with as-a-Service revenue up 25 percent as reported and 20 percent adjusted for currency. The annual exit run rate for as-a-Service revenue increased to $10.7 billion in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $8.6 billion in the first quarter of 2017. Analytics revenue of $4.8 billion increased 9 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency. Mobile revenue increased 19 percent as reported and 14 percent adjusted for currency and Security revenue increased 65 percent (60 percent adjusted for currency), reflecting strong demand for the companys highly-integrated security software, security managed services and the pervasive encryption capabilities in the z14 mainframe, and growth in security software solutions. 
Total expense and other (income) increased 9.1 percent in the first quarter of 2018 driven by actions the company took during the quarter to continue the repositioning of the business and due to currency impacts. The year-to-year increase was primarily the result of a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges (5 points) to further align the companys skills to the higher value areas, the effects of currency (5 points) and a lower level of intellectual property (IP) income (2 points), partially offset by lower operational spending (3 points), reflecting both a high level of investment and a continued focus on driving productivity. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 9.4 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors. 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
Federal audit of amended tax returns filed for prior years ($0.8 billion); partially offset by a provisional charge ($0.1 billion) as a result of the January 2018 IRS guidance related to U.S. tax reform. The prior year negative tax rate was primarily driven by discrete tax items ($0.5 billion), including the first-quarter 2017 intra-entity transfer of assets ($0.6 billion). Income from continuing operations of $1.7 billion decreased 4.4 percent and the net income margin was 8.8 percent, a decrease of 0.9 points versus the first quarter of 2017. Net income of $1.7 billion decreased 4.1 percent year to year. 
Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $1.7 billion decreased 14.4 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 2.1 points to 9.1 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $2.3 billion increased 2.1 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 11.9 percent, a decline of 0.3 points year to year. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2018 was (30.5) percent. 
· Decreases in total receivables ($3.1 billion); partially offset by 
· Increases in deferred costs ($1.0 billion) driven by capitalized sales commissions ($0.7 billion) related to the adoption of the new revenue standard, prepaid expenses and other current assets ($0.7 billion) driven by contract assets, prepaid pension assets ($0.5 billion), marketable securities ($0.3 billion) and deferred taxes ($0.2 billion). 
· Decreases in taxes ($0.8 billion), accounts payable ($0.7 billion) and total debt ($0.4 billion); partially offset by 
· Increases in deferred income ($1.6 billion). 
· Increases from net income ($1.7 billion), adoption of the new revenue standard ($0.5 billion) and retirement-related benefit plans ($0.5 billion); partially offset by 
· Decreases from dividends ($1.4 billion) and share repurchases ($0.8 billion).
Management Discussion  (continued) 
First Quarter in Review 
Cognitive Solutions revenue of $4,299 million grew 5.8 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year as the company continued to scale new platforms and solutions and increase its SaaS offerings. There was year-to-year growth in both Solutions Software and Transaction Processing Software on an as-reported and constant currency basis. 
Solutions Software revenue of $2,957 million grew 5.9 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, led by offerings in analytics and security. Within analytics, year-to-year growth, as reported and adjusted for currency, was driven by strong transactional performance. Revenue from security offerings grew again this quarter compared to the prior year with strong growth in SaaS. The company remains well positioned in this market and continues to increase its AI capabilities across its extensive security portfolio. 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
Transaction Processing Software revenue of $1,341 million grew 5.7 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year. Growth was driven by Z middleware, as clients continue to invest and grow their high-value, mission-critical workloads on the Z platform. 
Cognitive Solutions total strategic imperatives revenue of $2.8 billion grew 6 percent year to year as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency). Cloud revenue of $0.6 billion grew 6 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency), with an as-a-Service exit run rate of $2.0 billion. 
Pre-tax income of $1,333 million increased 5.1 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year. While the pre-tax margin declined 0.3 points to 26.2 percent, this included an impact of 1.8 points from higher workforce rebalancing charges in the current year. 
Global Business Services 
Global Business Services revenue of $4,174 million grew 4.2 percent as reported (decreased 1 percent adjusted for currency) in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year. These results reflect modest improvement in the year-to-year performance compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. As the company continues to transform this business, GBS signings grew again in the quarter, both as reported and adjusted for currency. There was growth year to year in strategic imperatives revenue reflecting the ongoing shift to areas of higher client value, such as cloud and analytics. 
Consulting revenue of $1,867 million grew 5.5 percent as reported (flat adjusted for currency) year to year in the first quarter of 2018. This performance was led by the Digital Strategy and iX business, which implements end-to-end digital transformation strategies for clients. Global Process Services revenue of $305 million decreased 2.9 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the first quarter of the prior year. Application Management revenue of $2,002 million grew 4.1 percent as reported (decreased 2 percent adjusted for currency) and reflected sequential improvement from the year-to-year performance in the fourth quarter of 2017. Application Management signings grew double digits as reported and adjusted for currency compared to the prior year as the company leverages its incumbency to help clients modernize their critical applications and migrate to the cloud. 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
Within GBS, total strategic imperatives revenue of $2.5 billion grew 12 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency) year to year. Cloud revenue of $1.0 billion grew 19 percent as reported (12 percent adjusted for currency), with an as-a-Service exit run rate of $1.2 billion. 
GBS gross profit margin stabilized in the first quarter, decreasing 0.1 points year to year to 23.3 percent with a 1.9 point improvement in trajectory from the fourth quarter of 2017. This stabilization was driven by productivity, revenue mix and pricing improvements. Pre-tax income of $145 million decreased 48.6 percent year to year. The pre-tax margin declined 3.5 points to 3.4 percent which included an impact of 1.9 points from a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges in the current year. Overall, this performance reflects the companys ongoing investments in the next generation of offerings, skills and enablement, and reshaping of its pyramids for each of the core service lines which will drive operating leverage in the long term. 
Infrastructure Services revenue of $5,825 million grew 6.2 percent as reported (flat adjusted for currency) compared to the first quarter of the prior year. This resulted from improved revenue from backlog realization as the company continues to help clients drive efficiencies and gain agility in their IT environments through hybrid cloud. Technical Support Services revenue of $1,782 million grew 1.2 percent as reported (decreased 4 percent adjusted for currency) year to year due in part to the hardware cycle dynamics, offset by growth in core multi-vendor support services. Integration Software first-quarter revenue of $1,019 million grew 5.1 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, with continued strong growth in SaaS offerings across the portfolio and the companys new IBM Cloud Private offering. This portfolio remains essential to clients as they connect multiple environments through a single architecture. 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
Services Backlog and Signings 
The estimated total services backlog at March 31, 2018 was $121 billion, an increase of 4.2 percent as reported (decrease of 2 percent adjusted for currency). There was growth in Global Technology Services backlog as reported, but a decrease year to year adjusted for currency. GBS backlog was flat year to year as reported and decreased year to year adjusted for currency. 
Total services backlog includes Infrastructure Services, Consulting, Global Process Services, Application Management and Technical Support Services. Total backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract which is either non-cancellable, or which historically has very low likelihood of termination, given the criticality of certain services to the companys clients. Total backlog does not include as-a-Service arrangements that allow for termination under contractual commitment terms. Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and adjustments for currency. 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
Within Systems Hardware, IBM Z revenue grew 59.3 percent as reported (54 percent adjusted for currency) year to year. The adoption of the z14 was again broad based with new clients added to the platform across several countries during the quarter. The company continues to address emerging workloads across the Z platform including blockchain, machine learning, dev ops and payments. The new z14 model, designed specifically for cloud environments, was recently announced bringing the power of IBM Z to a broader set of clients. The mainframe continues to deliver a high-value, secure and scalable platform that is critical in managing clients complex environments. 
Power Systems grew for the second consecutive quarter with revenue up 6.1 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, driven by the entry-level portfolio and cloud-enabled offerings. Power Systems remain vital to many workloads and during the first quarter, the company began shipping POWER 9 entry systems which are designed for AIX, IBM i and Linux workloads. These cloud-ready systems provide leadership capabilities in advanced analytics, cloud environments and data intensive AI workloads. 
Within Systems, total strategic imperatives revenue of $0.7 billion grew 28 percent as reported (24 percent adjusted for currency) year to year in the first quarter of 2018. Cloud revenue of $0.5 billion grew 16 percent as reported (12 percent adjusted for currency). 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
Global Financing 
Global Financing is a reportable segment that is measured as a stand-alone entity. Global Financing facilitates IBM clients acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has the expertise, while generating strong returns on equity. Global Financing also optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients. Sales of equipment include equipment returned at the end of a lease, surplus internal equipment and used equipment purchased externally. Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based upon this product information, Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio. 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
Global Financing pre-tax income increased 21.3 percent to $377 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to higher gross profit of $59 million and a decrease in total expenses of $7 million. 
Total unguaranteed residual value of leases was $671 million as of March 31, 2018. In addition to the unguaranteed residual value, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease. Third-party residual value guarantees increase the minimum lease payments as provided for by accounting standards that are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease, direct financing lease or operating lease. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees of sales-type leases were $21 million and $43 million for the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees of direct financing leases were $48 million and $34 million for the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The associated aggregate guaranteed future values at the scheduled end of lease were $3 million for the financing transactions originated during each of the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. 
Geographic Revenue 
Total revenue of $19,072 million increased 5.1 percent as reported and was flat adjusted for currency in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year. Americas revenue of $8,707 million was flat as reported and adjusted for currency. EMEA revenue of $6,176 million increased 13.6 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency. Asia Pacific revenue of $4,188 million increased 4.8 percent as reported and was flat adjusted for currency in the first quarter versus the prior year. 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
In EMEA, France increased 24.6 percent and 8 percent adjusted for currency and Spain increased 28.9 percent and 12 percent adjusted for currency, compared to the same period in the prior year. Germany increased 11.5 percent as reported, but declined 3 percent adjusted for currency and the UK increased 10.2 percent as reported, but decreased 2 percent adjusted for currency. The Middle East and Africa region increased 9.3 percent as reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expense 
· The effects of currency (4 points); partially offset by 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
· Lower spending (2 points). 
Bad debt expense decreased $2 million year to year. The receivables provision coverage was 1.7 percent at March 31, 2018, an increase of 10 basis points from December 31, 2017 and a decrease of 50 basis points from March 31, 2017. 
Research, Development and Engineering 
· The effects of currency (2 points). 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
· Higher foreign currency transaction losses ($125 million); and 
· Higher non-operating retirement-related costs ($55 million); partially offset by 
· Increased gains on derivative instruments ($59 million); and 
· Higher interest income ($40 million). 
Interest Expense 
Interest expense increased $30 million year to year in the first quarter of 2018. Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings if the related external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external business. Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) for the first quarter of 2018 was $347 million, an increase of $54 million year to year, primarily driven by a higher average debt balance and higher average interest rates. 
Retirement-Related Plans 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
Total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost increased by $63 million compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by lower expected return on plan assets ($48 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($42 million); partially offset by lower interest costs ($40 million). 
The continuing operations effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was (47.5) percent, a decrease of 24.4 points compared to the first quarter of 2017. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was (30.5) percent, a decrease of 21.1 points compared to the first quarter of 2017. 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
Financial Position 
At March 31, 2018, the balance sheet remains strong and the company continues to have the financial flexibility to support the business over the long term. Cash, marketable securities and restricted cash at quarter end were $13,155 million. The company continues to manage the investment portfolio to meet its capital preservation and liquidity objectives. Total debt of $46,387 million decreased $437 million from December 31, 2017, driven by debt maturities of $3,298 million, partially offset by new debt issuances of $2,198 million. Within total debt, $31,667 million, or approximately 68 percent, is in support of the Global Financing business. In the first three months of 2018, the company generated $4,602 million in cash from operations compared to $3,955 million in the first quarter of 2017. The company has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations and continues to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its credit facilities. 
The assets and debt associated with the Global Financing business are a significant part of the companys financial position. The financial position amounts appearing on pages 5 and 6 are the consolidated amounts including Global Financing. 
At March 31, 2018, substantially all client and commercial financing assets were IT related assets, and approximately 53 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers. The increase in 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
investment grade year to year (1 point) was driven primarily by rating changes within the existing portfolio, not by changing the companys approach to the market. This investment grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio. 
The company has a long-standing practice of taking mitigating actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties, including credit insurance, financial guarantees, non-recourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease. Adjusting for the mitigation actions, the investment grade content would increase by 17 points to 70 percent, an increase of 4 points year to year. 
IBM Working Capital 
· A decline in receivables of $2,401 million ($2,843 million adjusted for currency) primarily as a result of collections of higher year-end balances and the reclassification of certain trade receivables to prepaid and other current assets due to the adoption of the new revenue standard; partially offset by 
· An increase of $713 million ($653 million adjusted for currency) in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to the reclassification from receivables. 
· A decrease in short-term debt of $1,010 million ($1,015 million adjusted for currency) primarily as a result of maturities of $3,248 million; partially offset by reclassifications of $1,742 million from long-term debt to reflect upcoming maturities; and 
· A decrease in accounts payable of $715 million ($786 million adjusted for currency) reflecting declines from typically higher year-end balances; partially offset by 
· An increase in deferred income of $1,507 million ($1,346 adjusted for currency) primarily due to the cyclical increase in annual billings. 
Roll Forward of Total IBM Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses (included in Total IBM) 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
The total IBM receivables provision coverage was 1.7 percent at March 31, 2018, an increase of 10 basis points compared to December 31, 2017. The majority of the write-offs during the three months ended March 31, 2018 related to Global Financing receivables, which had been previously reserved. 
Global Financing Receivables and Allowances 
The percentage of Global Financing receivables reserved increased from 1.1 percent at December 31, 2017, to 1.2 percent at March 31, 2018. The increase was driven by additional provisions of $4 million and by the overall decline in gross receivables, partially offset by write-offs of $6 million of receivables previously reserved. Specific reserves decreased 1 percent from $258 million at December 31, 2017, to $255 million at March 31, 2018. Unallocated reserves increased 10 percent from $78 million at December 31, 2017, to $86 million at March 31, 2018. 
Roll Forward of Global Financing Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses 
Global Financings bad debt expense was $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $10 million for the same period in 2017. 
Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities 
· An increase in retirement plans assets of $486 million ($414 million adjusted for currency) driven by the expected returns on plan assets, partially offset by interest costs; and 
· An increase in deferred costs of $457 million ($449 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by capitalized sales commissions with the adoption of the new revenue standard; partially offset by 
· A decrease of $694 million in long-term financing receivables ($810 million adjusted for currency) reflecting seasonal reductions from higher year-end balances. 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
· Current upcoming maturities of long-term debt of $1,742 million. 
Debt 
The companys funding requirements are continually monitored and strategies are executed to manage the overall asset and liability profile. Additionally, the company maintains sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as needed. 
Total debt of $46,387 million decreased $437 million from December 31, 2017. 
Non-Global Financing debt of $14,709 million was down $681 million from December 31, 2017 and up $403 million from March 31, 2017. 
Global Financing debt-to-equity ratio 
The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arms-length pricing. 
Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the companys external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financings external client and internal business is included in the Global Financing Results of Operations on page 58 and in note 7, Segments, on page 35. In the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense. 
Total equity increased by $565 million from December 31, 2017 primarily due to increases from net income ($1,679 million), adoption of the new revenue standard ($524 million) and retirement-related plans ($537 million); partially offset by decreases from dividends ($1,382 million) and gross common share repurchases ($827 million). 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
The companys cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 7, are summarized in the following table. These amounts include the cash flows associated with the Global Financing business. 
· Working capital improvements of $484 million; and 
· An increase in cash provided by financing receivables of $313 million; partially offset by 
· An increase in net non-operating financing receivables of $1,659 million, primarily due to an increase in commercial financing volumes and changing business dynamics within OEM payables. 
· An increase in net cash used in debt transactions of $1,190 million primarily driven by a higher level of maturities; partially offset by 
· A decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases of $516 million. 
Looking Forward 
The companys strategies, investments and actions are all made with an objective of optimizing long-term performance. A long-term perspective ensures that the company is well-positioned to take advantage of the major shifts in technology, business and the global economy. 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
Free cash flow realization, which is defined as free cash flow to income from continuing operations (GAAP), is expected to be over 100%. The company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2018. Free cash flow expectations include a year-to-year headwind from strong receivables collections in 2017, an approximate $600 million year-to-year headwind from cash tax payments and an expected increase in capital expenditures. 
The company expects 2018 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $3.2 billion, an increase of approximately $300 million compared to 2017. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2017. Consistent with the newly adopted FASB guidance for the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2017. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion, an increase of approximately $300 million compared to 2017, driven by lower income from expected return on assets and a year-to-year impact due to the pension obligation adjustment resulting from the successful resolution of the UK pension litigation matter in 2017. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2018, approximately flat compared to 2017. 
Currency Rate Fluctuations 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
Management uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows. As previously noted, the company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result the company does not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric. 
The following is managements view of cash flows for the first three months of 2018 and 2017 prepared in a manner 
In the first three months of 2018, the company generated free cash flow of $1.3 billion, an increase of $0.3 billion versus the prior year. The increase was driven by performance in working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes and higher capital expenditures. Net capital investments of $0.9 billion increased $0.1 billion year to year. In the first three months of 2018, the company continued to focus its cash utilization on returning value to shareholders including $1.4 billion in dividends and $0.8 billion in gross common stock repurchases (5.0 million shares).
