industry verticals and grow its Software-as-a-Service offerings. There was growth in key areas, such as analytics, Watson platforms and industry-specific solutions, which continue to scale. This was offset by transition in other areas, including talent, collaboration and commerce, as the company continues to modernize these offerings in response to secular market shifts. Within Solutions Software, analytics grew year-to-year as reported and adjusted for currency driven by growth in the DB2 portfolio, data science offerings and the new IBM Cloud Private for Data offering, which makes data ready for AI. Within industry solutions, strong growth was led by Watson Financial Services, which leverages businesses expertise to help clients manage increasing regulatory requirements and Watson IoT, as the business continues to embed AI across the IoT portfolio.

Global Business Services 
Global Business Services revenue of $4,192 million increased 2.3 percent as reported and was flat adjusted for currency in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year. Although the revenue growth rate declined sequentially as reported in the second quarter versus the first quarter of 2018 on a year-to-year basis, there was a 1 point improvement in the second quarter versus the prior quarter on an adjusted for currency year-to-year basis. This was driven by the realization of revenue from the opening backlog at the beginning of the year. The company continued to realign its practice model around key growth platforms including digital transformation, cloud applications and cognitive processes. The digital business had continued growth during the second quarter compared to the prior-year period, driven by its Digital Business Strategy offerings, which help clients drive digital transformation, and Mobile offerings. For the first six months of the year, Global Business Services revenue of $8,365 million increased 3.2 percent as reported, but declined 1 percent adjusted for currency. 
In the second quarter, Consulting revenue of $1,931 million increased 6.0 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year led by the companys offerings in Cloud and Digital. Global Process Services (GPS) revenue of $315 million decreased 1.5 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year. Application Management revenue of $1,946 million decreased 0.5 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency). This decline was driven by the traditional Enterprise Application Managed Services, partially offset by growth in strategic offerings such as Cloud Migration Factory and Cloud Application Development. 
Second-quarter 2018 GBS strategic imperatives revenue of $2.7 billion grew 8 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency). Cloud revenue of $1.1 billion grew 10 percent as reported and 8 percent adjusted for currency, with an as-a-Service exit run rate of $1.4 billion. For the first six months of the year, GBS strategic imperatives revenue of $5.2 billion grew 10 percent as reported and 6 percent adjusted for currency year to year. Cloud revenue of $2.1 billion grew 14 percent as reported (10 percent adjusted for currency).

In the second quarter, Infrastructure Services revenue of $5,768 million increased 4.0 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, driven primarily by improved realization of revenue from backlog as the company shifts clients to the cloud. During the second-quarter 2018, the company announced the expansion of IBM Cloud capabilities to 18 availability zones across the world. This global expansion is important for clients to have the ability to better manage and control their data cloud journey as they implement hybrid cloud especially given increased data regulations.

decreased 20.9 percent and pre-tax margin decreased 2.3 points to 7.5 percent. The year-to-year pre-tax margin in the first six months of 2018 compared to the prior year included an impact of 1.4 points from a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges in the first quarter which are expected to yield productivity benefits in the second half of 2018. 
Services Backlog and Signings 
The estimated total services backlog at June 30, 2018 was $116 billion, a decrease of 1.6 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency). Global Technology Services (GTS) backlog was essentially flat as reported and adjusted for currency year to year and GBS backlog declined year to year both as reported and adjusted for currency. 
Total services backlog includes Infrastructure Services, Consulting, Global Process Services, Application Management and Technical Support Services. Total backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract which is either non-cancellable, or which historically has very low likelihood of termination, given the criticality of certain services to the companys clients. Total backlog does not include as-a-Service arrangements that allow for termination under contractual commitment terms. Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and adjustments for currency. 
Signings include Infrastructure Services, Consulting, Global Process Services and Application Management contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Technical Support Services (TSS) are generally not included in signings as maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues equal renewals. Certain longer-term TSS contracts that have characteristics similar to outsourcing contracts are included in signings.

For the first six months of 2018, Systems revenue of $3,676 million increased 17.0 percent as reported (14 percent adjusted for currency) with strong growth in Systems Hardware both as reported and adjusted for currency driven by IBM Z and Power Systems. Operating Systems Software increased 1.8 percent as reported, but declined 1 percent adjusted for currency, compared to the prior year. 
Second quarter IBM Z revenue grew 114.5 percent as reported (112 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, driven by new workload MIPS. The z14 adoption remained broad based, across most geographies and industries, with new clients added to the platform and existing clients growing and expanding workloads on the platform. The company continues to address emerging workloads across the IBM Z platform including blockchain, machine learning, dev ops and payments. The newly announced single-frame z14 designed specifically for cloud environments had good acceptance by clients during the second quarter. 
Power Systems grew revenue 5.0 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, driven by the new POWER9 entry-level portfolio and continued growth in Linux. Power Systems are designed for the cloud environment and provide leadership capability in advanced analytics and data intensive workloads in AI, HANA and UNIX markets. During the second quarter, the U.S. Department of Energy unveiled Summit, the most powerful commercially available supercomputer, built by IBM Systems with POWER9 technology. 
Storage Systems returned to growth in the second quarter with revenue up 3.7 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency) year to year. This growth was geographically broad based and led by double-digit growth in All Flash Arrays. 
Second-quarter Systems strategic imperatives revenue of $1.2 billion grew 57 percent year to year as reported (55 percent adjusted for currency). Cloud revenue of $0.8 billion grew 30 percent as reported (28 percent adjusted for currency).

In the second quarter of 2018, pre-tax income of $346 million grew 376.8 percent and pre-tax margin increased 10.5 points year to year to 14.3 percent driven primarily by the IBM Z product cycle. For the first six months of the year, pre-tax income of $143 million increased $258 million and pre-tax margin increased 6.8 points year to year to 3.5 percent also due to the IBM Z product cycle, partially offset by actions taken in the first quarter to better position the systems cost structure over the longer term, which impacted the pre-tax margin by 2.7 points. 
Global Financing 
Global Financing is a reportable segment that is measured as a stand-alone entity. Global Financing facilitates IBM clients acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has the expertise, while generating strong returns on equity. Global Financing also optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients. Sales of equipment include equipment returned at the end of a lease, surplus internal equipment and used equipment purchased externally. Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and cycles for the IBM products under lease. Based upon this product information, Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.

The year-to-year increases in internal financing revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 were due to higher asset yields and higher average asset balances. The increases in external financing revenue in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to the same periods in 2017, respectively, were due to higher average asset balances, partially offset by lower asset yields. 
Global Financing pre-tax income increased 26.8 percent to $357 million in the second quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to higher gross profit of $95 million, partially offset by an increase in expense of $19 million. Pre-tax income increased 23.9 percent to $734 million in the first six months of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, due to higher gross profit of $154 million, partially offset by an increase in expense of $12 million. The increase in expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in financing receivables provisions due to higher reserve requirements in the current year. 
Global Financing return on equity was 31.2 percent and 31.9 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to 26.0 percent and 25.1 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. The increase in return on equity in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, compared to the same periods of 2017, was due to the increase in net income, partially offset by an increase in equity. See page 88 for the details of the after-tax income and return on equity calculation. 
Total unguaranteed residual value of leases, including operating leases, was $686 million as of June 30, 2018. In addition to the unguaranteed residual value, on a limited basis, Global Financing will obtain guarantees of the future value of the equipment to be returned at end of lease. Third-party residual value guarantees increase the minimum lease payments as provided for by accounting standards that are utilized in determining the classification of a lease as a sales-type lease, direct financing lease or operating lease. The aggregate asset values associated with the guarantees of sales-type leases were $134 million and $63 million for the financing transactions originated during the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively and $156 million and $106 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was $367 million and $713 million, respectively, an increase of $47 million and $101 million versus the comparable prior year periods, primarily driven by a higher average debt balance and higher average interest rates. 
Retirement-Related Plans 
Table of Contents 
Management Discussion  (continued) 
In the second quarter of 2018, total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost increased by $39 million compared to the second quarter of 2017, primarily driven by lower expected return on plan assets ($66 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($26 million); partially offset by lower interest costs ($52 million). Total cost for the first six months of 2018 increased by $102 million versus the first six months of 2017, primarily driven by lower expected return on plan assets ($114 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($67 million), partially offset by lower interest costs ($93 million). 
As discussed in the Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings section on page 56, the company characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in the second quarter of 2018 were $364 million, a decrease of $7 million compared to the second quarter of 2017, primarily driven by lower defined contribution plans cost ($7 million). Non-operating costs of $394 million in the second quarter of 2018 increased $45 million year to year, driven primarily by lower expected return on plan assets ($66 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($26 million), partially offset by lower interest costs ($52 million). For the first six months of 2018, operating retirement-related costs were $750 million, an increase of $2 million compared to the first six months of 2017. Non-operating costs of $796 million increased $100 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by lower expected return on plan assets ($114 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($67 million); partially offset by lower interest costs ($93 million). 
The continuing operations effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was 13.5 percent, an increase of 8.9 points compared to the second quarter of 2017.

Financial Position 
At June 30, 2018, the balance sheet remained strong and the company continues to have the financial flexibility to support the business for the long term. Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at quarter end were $11,926 million. The company continues to manage the investment portfolio to meet its capital preservation and liquidity objectives. Total debt of $45,497 million decreased $1,326 million from December 31, 2017, driven by debt maturities of $3,652 million; partially offset by new debt issuances of $2,535 million. Within total debt, $31,056 million, or approximately 68 percent, is in support of the Global Financing business. In the first six months of 2018, the company generated $6,896 million in cash from operations, compared to $7,421 million in the first six months of 2017. The company has consistently generated strong cash flows from operations and continues to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and its credit facilities.

At June 30, 2018, substantially all client and commercial financing assets were IT related assets, and approximately 54 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers. The increase in investment grade year to year (2 points) was driven primarily by rating changes within the existing portfolio, not by changing the companys approach to the market. This investment grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio.

· An increase in short-term debt of $659 million ($719 million adjusted for currency) primarily as a result of maturities of $3,601 million; partially offset by reclassifications of $3,774 million from long-term debt to reflect upcoming maturities. 
Roll Forward of Total IBM Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses (included in Total IBM) 
The total IBM receivables provision coverage was 1.8 percent at June 30, 2018, an increase of 20 basis points compared to December 31, 2017. The majority of the write-offs during the six months ended June 30, 2018 related to Global Financing receivables, which had been previously reserved. 
Global Financing Receivables and Allowances 
The percentage of Global Financing receivables reserved increased from 1.1 percent at December 31, 2017, to 1.2 percent at June 30, 2018. The increase was driven by the overall decline in gross receivables. Specific reserves decreased 1 percent from $258 million at December 31, 2017, to $255 million at June 30, 2018. Unallocated reserves increased 7 percent from $78 million at December 31, 2017, to $84 million at June 30, 2018.

Total debt of $45,497 million decreased $1,326 million from December 31, 2017, driven by debt maturities of $3,652 million; partially offset by new debt issuances of $2,535 million. 
Non-Global Financing debt of $14,441 million was down $949 million from December 31, 2017 and down $2,186 million from June 30, 2017. 
Global Financing debt-to-equity ratio 
The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arms-length pricing. 
Global Financing provides financing predominantly for the companys external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. As previously stated, the company measures Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financings external client and internal business is included in the Global Financing Results of Operations on page 70 and in note 7, Segments, on pages 36 and 37. In the companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financings internal financing to the company is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense. 
Equity 
Total equity increased by $923 million from December 31, 2017 primarily due to increases from net income ($4,083 million), an increase in retirement-related amounts ($1,121 million) and transition adjustments related to the adoption of the new revenue standard ($524 million); partially offset by decreases from dividends ($2,819 million) and an increase in treasury stock ($1,859 million) primarily due to share repurchases. 
The companys cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 7, are summarized in the following table. These amounts include the cash flows associated with the Global Financing business.

· A decrease in cash provided by financing receivables of $432 million; partially offset by 
· An increase in net non-operating financing receivables of $394 million; 
· An increase in cash used for net capital expenditures of $329 million; and 
· An increase in net cash used in debt transactions of $3,506 million primarily driven by lower net debt issuances; partially offset by

Free cash flow realization, which is defined as free cash flow to income from continuing operations (GAAP), is expected to be over 100%. The company continues to expect free cash flow to be approximately $12 billion in 2018. Free cash flow expectations for the year include a year-to-year headwind from strong receivables performance in 2017, a year-to-year headwind from cash tax payments, which has been fully realized by the end of the second quarter, and a full year expected increase in capital expenditures. 
The company expects 2018 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $3.1 billion, an increase of approximately $200 million compared to 2017. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2017. Consistent with the new FASB guidance for the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2017. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, an increase of approximately $200 million compared to 2017, driven by lower income from expected return on assets and a year-to-year impact due to the pension obligation adjustment resulting from the successful resolution of the UK pension litigation matter in 2017. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2018, approximately flat compared to 2017.

currency hedging programs for cash management purposes which temporarily mitigate, but do not eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on the companys financial results. 
In the companys 2017 Annual Report, on pages 67 to 70, there is a discussion of the companys liquidity including two tables that present five years of data. The table presented on page 67 includes net cash from operating activities, cash and marketable securities and the size of the companys global credit facilities for each of the past five years. For the six months ended, or as of, as applicable, June 30, 2018, those amounts are $6.9 billion for net cash from operating activities, $11.9 billion of cash, restricted cash and marketable securities and $15.3 billion in global credit facilities, respectively.

Management Discussion  (continued) 
Management uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows. As previously noted, the company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result the company does not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric. 
The following is managements view of cash flows for the first six months of 2018 and 2017 prepared in a manner consistent with the description above.  
In the first six months of 2018, the company generated free cash flow of $3.2 billion, a decrease of $0.4 billion versus the prior year driven by higher cash taxes and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by working capital performance. Net capital expenditures of $1.9 billion increased $0.3 billion year to year reflecting increased investments to build out global cloud datacenters. In the first six months of 2018, the company continued to focus its cash utilization on returning value to shareholders including $2.8 billion in dividends and $1.8 billion in gross common stock repurchases (11.7 million shares).
