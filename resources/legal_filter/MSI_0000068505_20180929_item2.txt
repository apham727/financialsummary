Item 2.
During the second quarter of 2018, we modified our internal reporting structure to better align the way financial information is reported to and analyzed by executive leadership in part as a result of recent acquisitions contributing to the growth within the newly aligned Services and Software segment.
Previously, we had two reporting segments: Products and Services.
The changes in reporting structure consist of Systems Integration related revenue and costs moving from the old Services segment into the newly presented Products and Systems Integration segment and Software related revenue and costs moving from the old Products segment into the newly presented Services and Software segment.
Executive Overview



Recent Developments



We have reached an agreement with the UK Home Office on terms for the new direction of the UK Emergency Services Network (“ESN”) as well as an agreement on terms to extend the Airwave contract through 2022.

Our Business



We are a leading global provider of mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software, and services.
Our products and services help government, public safety and commercial customers improve their operations through increased effectiveness, efficiency, and safety of their mobile workforces.
We conduct our business globally and manage it by two segments:



Products and Systems Integration: The Products and Systems Integration segment offers an extensive portfolio of infrastructure, devices, accessories, video solutions, and the implementation, optimization, and integration of such systems, devices, and applications, including the Company’s: (i) “ASTRO” products, which meet the Association of Public Safety Communications Officials Project 25 standard, (ii) “Dimetra” products which meet the European Telecommunications Standards Institute Terrestrial Trunked Radio “TETRA” standard, (iii) Professional and Commercial Radio (“PCR”) products, (iv) broadband technology products, such as Long-Term Evolution (“LTE”), and (v) video solutions, such as video surveillance cameras.
The primary customers of the Products and Systems Integration segment are government, public safety and first-responder agencies, municipalities, and commercial and industrial customers who operate private communications networks and video solutions and manage a mobile workforce.
In the third quarter of 2018, the segment’s net sales were $1.3 billion, representing 69% of our consolidated net sales.
Services and Software: The Services and Software segment provides a full set of offerings for government, public safety and commercial communication networks.
Services includes a continuum of service offerings beginning with repair, technical support and maintenance.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements.
The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2019 and interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted.
In July 2018 the FASB issued ASU 2018-11 that amended the ASU to include an additional (and optional) transition relief.
The additional transition relief provides entities the option to adopt the ASU by applying the new ASU at the adoption date and recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption without restatement of comparative periods.
The new ASU must be adopted utilizing the modified retrospective method as of the earliest comparative period presented if the optional adoption method is not selected.
We will adopt the ASU on January 1, 2019, utilizing the modified retrospective method as of the adoption date.
We are continuing to assess the impact of the ASU on our financial statements, including the package of available practical expedients, required disclosures, and changes to internal controls.
Based on the preliminary work completed, we expect a material impact to our balance sheet through the recording of right-of-use assets and lease obligations that are not required to be recorded within the balance sheet under current accounting standards.
40



In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which requires entities to estimate and recognize current expected credit losses rather than delay recognition of credit losses until the loss is probable of occurring.
The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2020, and interim periods within that reporting period with early option permitted.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2019 with adoption permitted immediately in any interim or annual period (including the current period).
The guidance related to cash flow and net investment hedges existing at the date of adoption should be applied using the modified retrospective method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
The guidance related to presentation and disclosure should be applied prospectively.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
2018-14, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits - Defined Benefit Plans - General (Subtopic 715-20) - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans,” which modifies the disclosure requirements for the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans.
The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2020 with early adoption permitted.
The ASU requires a retrospective adoption method.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



We adopted ASU No.
2016-16, “Accounting for Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory” on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method of adoption.
The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under accounting standards in effect in those periods.
This ASU eliminates the prior application of deferring the income tax effect of intra-entity asset transfers, other than inventory, until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use.
We adopted ASU No.
2017-07, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective method of adoption.
The amendments in the ASU require that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic cost (benefit) and report that component in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period.
As a result of the ASU, the presentation of net periodic cost (benefit) has been updated to classify all components of our net periodic benefit, with the exception of the service cost component, within Other in Other income (expense) on the statement of operations.
We reclassified $18 million and $10 million in the three months ended September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively, and $58 million and $10 million in the nine months ended September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
We adopted ASU No.
2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," and all the related amendments (collectively “ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.
We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to our opening retained earnings.
The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect in those periods.
We retained much of the same accounting treatment used to recognize revenue under ASC 606 as under accounting standards in effect in prior periods.
Services contracts continue to be recognized ratably over relevant contract terms as we stand ready to perform.
Finally, revenue on equipment sales continues to be recognized based on delivery terms as aligned with the transfer of control.
Under the new standard, we identified distinct promises to transfer goods and/or services within our contracts.
For contracts that are recognized under percentage of completion accounting, we considered the factors used to determine whether promises made in the contract are distinct and determined that devices and accessories represent distinct goods.
For the remaining promised goods and services within our system contracts, we continue to recognize revenue on these contracts using a cost-to-cost method based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer over time.
Under the new standard, revenue recognition for software sales is accelerated based on when control of software licenses and related support services are transferred to the customer.
Amounts deferred under previous software accounting rules due to a lack of vendor-specific objective evidence have been recognized as an adjustment through opening retained earnings.

 Historically, we presented transactions that involved a third-party sales representative on a net basis.
After considering the control concept and the remaining three indicators of gross presentation under the new standard, we have determined that we are the principal in contracts that involve a third-party sales representative.
Under prior accounting standards, we expensed sales commissions and other costs to obtain a contract as incurred.
However, under the new standard, we capitalize sales commissions and certain other costs as incremental costs to obtain a contract.
The new standard clarified the definition of a receivable and requires us to present our net position in a contract with a customer on the balance sheet.
The position is presented as either a receivable, contract asset, or a contract liability.
Under the new definition, accounts receivable are unconditional rights to consideration from a customer.
Contract assets represent rights to consideration from a customer in exchange for transferred goods and services that are conditional on events other than the passage of time.
Contract liabilities represent obligations to transfer goods and services for which we have received, or is due, consideration from a customer respectively.
We reclassified our customer positions to align with the new definitions and presentation guidance.
Accounts receivable which are not due from customers have been reclassified into Other current assets.
