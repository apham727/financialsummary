PART II - OTHER INFORMATION



ITEM 1.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



We are not currently a party to any material litigation.
However, in the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in a limited number of legal actions, both as plaintiff and defendant, and could incur uninsured liability in any one or more of them.
No assurances can be given with respect to the extent or outcome of any future litigation or dispute.
ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS



In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below.
The risks described below are not the only risks that we face.
Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk to us as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, geopolitical instability, declines in income or asset values, or other factors.
Negative trends or sentiments in worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services.
In March 2018, the U.S. announced steel and aluminum tariffs on imports from China.
These tariffs may lead to increased international trade tensions, which could result in the adoption of tariffs by other countries.
See “Current business outlook” in this Form 10-Q for information regarding recent business conditions.
We Make Significant Investments in New Products that May Not Be Successful or Achieve Expected Returns.
We plan to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new and existing products and technologies.
For example, in 2017 we launched LabVIEW NXG, the most recent version of our flagship software application.
We have made and expect to make significant investments in software development related to the new and enhanced features of this product.
These investments involve a number of risks as the commercial success of such efforts depend on many factors, including our ability to anticipate and respond to innovation, achieve the desired technological fit, and be effective with our marketing and distribution efforts.
Even if our new products are profitable, our operating margins for new products may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.
Our Success Depends on New Product Introductions and Market Acceptance of Our Products.
Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis to replace declining revenues from older products, and on increasing penetration in domestic and international markets.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, we have experienced significant delays between the announcement and the commercial availability of new products.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to introduce new products in accordance with announced release dates, that our new products will achieve market acceptance or that any such acceptance will be sustained for any significant period.
Our Reported Financial Results May be Adversely Affected by Changes in Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the U.S. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.
These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of our business, such as software revenue recognition, software capitalization, and income tax uncertainties, are complex and involve subjective judgments by management.
For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers which, as amended, supersedes nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance and which became effective for us for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2018.
(See “Note 1 – Operations and summary of significant accounting policies” and "Note 2 - Revenue") for additional discussion of the accounting changes).
Our international sales are subject to inherent risks, including, but not limited to: 



•fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar;



•unexpected changes to currency policy or currency restrictions in foreign jurisdictions;



•delays in collecting trade receivable balances from customers in developing economies;



•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;



•fluctuations in local economies; 



•disparate and changing employment laws in foreign jurisdictions;



•difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; 



•costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries; 



•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; 



•government actions throughout the world;



•tariffs and other trade barriers; and, 



•the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our efforts to increase foreign market penetration.
In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies.
Any violation of foreign or U.S. laws by our employees, contractors or agents, even if such violation is prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We must also comply with various import and export regulations.
The application of these various regulations depends on the classification of our products which can change over time as such regulations are modified or interpreted.
As a result, even if we are currently in compliance with applicable regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not have to incur additional costs or take additional compliance actions in the future.
Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or termination of import and export privileges, 



43



which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Additionally, the regulatory environment in some countries is very restrictive as their governments try to protect their local economy and value of their local currency against the U.S. dollar.
Our Manufacturing Capacity, and a Substantial Majority of our Warehousing and Distribution Capacity is Located Outside of the U.S. We manufacture substantially all of our product volume at our facilities in Debrecen, Hungary and Penang, Malaysia.
In order to enable timely shipment of products to our customers we maintain the substantial majority of our inventory at our international locations.
In addition to being subject to the risks of maintaining such a concentration of manufacturing capacity and global inventory, these facilities and their operations are also subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including, but not limited to:



•the volatility of the Hungarian forint and the Malaysian ringgit relative to the U.S. dollar; 



•changing and potentially unstable political environments; 



•significant and frequent changes in corporate tax laws; 



•difficulty in managing manufacturing operations in foreign countries; 



•challenges in expanding capacity to meet increased demand; 



•difficulty in achieving or maintaining product quality; 



•interruption to transportation flows for delivery of components to us and finished goods to our customers; 



•restrictive labor codes; and, 



•increasing labor costs.
No assurance can be given that our efforts to mitigate these risks will be successful.
Any failure to effectively deal with the risks above could result in an interruption in the operations of our facilities in Hungary or Malaysia which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Our centralization of inventory and distribution from a limited number of shipping points is subject to inherent risks, including:



•burdens of complying with additional or more complex VAT and customs regulations; and, 



•concentration of inventory increasing the risks associated with fire, natural disasters and logistics disruptions to customer order fulfillment.
Any failure or delay in distribution from our facilities in Hungary and Malaysia could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Our Financial Performance is Subject to Risks Associated with Changes in the Value of the U.S. Dollar versus Local Currencies.
The vast majority of our sales outside of the U.S. are denominated in local currencies, and accordingly, the U.S. dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates.
If the local currencies in which we sell our products continue to strengthen against the U.S. dollar, we have in the past, and in the future may need to, lower our prices in the local currency to remain competitive in our international markets.
In the past, we have noted that significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates in the markets in which we do business has had a significant impact on the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated firm commitments, on our ability to forecast our U.S. dollar equivalent net sales and expenses and on the effectiveness of our hedging programs.
In the past, these dynamics have also adversely affected our net sales growth in international markets and may pose similar challenges in the future.
See “Results of Operations” in this Form 10-Q for further discussion on the effect that changes in the foreign currency exchange rates have had on our operating results.
See “Current business outlook” in this Form 10-Q for information regarding recent business conditions.
We continue to make a concentrated effort to increase our net sales through the pursuit of orders with a value greater than $1.0 million.
These types of orders expose us to significant additional business and legal risks compared to smaller orders.
Our very large customers frequently require contract terms that vary substantially from our standard terms of sale.
At times these orders include terms that impose critical delivery commitments and severe contractual liabilities if we fail to provide the required quantity of products at the required delivery times, impose product acceptance requirements and product performance evaluation requirements which create uncertainty with respect to the timing of our ability to recognize revenue from such orders, allow the customers to cancel or delay orders without liability, require us to develop specific product mitigation plans for product delivery constraints caused by unexpected or catastrophic situations to help assure quick production recovery, and that require most favored customer pricing, significant discounts, extended payment terms and volume rebates.
At times these customers require broad indemnity obligations and large direct and consequential damage provisions in the event we breach our contracts with them.
At times these contracts have 



44



supply constraint requirements which mandate that we allocate large product inventories for a specific contract.
These inventory requirements expose us to higher risks of inventory obsolescence and can adversely impact our ability to provide adequate product supply to other customers.
While we attempt to limit the number of contracts that contain the non-standard terms of sale described above and attempt to contractually limit our potential liability under such contracts, we have been and expect to be required to agree to some or all of such provisions to secure orders from these customers and to continue to grow our business.
In addition, these larger orders are more volatile, are subject to greater discount variability and may contract at a faster pace during an economic downturn.
We attempt to manage these risks but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts.
This dynamic may also have an impact on the historical seasonal pattern of our net sales and our results of operations.
These types of orders also make managing inventory levels more difficult as we have in the past and may have to in the future build large quantities of inventory in anticipation of future demand that may not materialize.
Our Product Revenues are Dependent on Certain Industries and Contractions in these Industries Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Results of Operations.
Sales of our products are dependent on customers in certain industries, particularly the telecommunications, semiconductor, consumer electronics, automotive, energy, automated test equipment, defense and aerospace industries.
We cannot predict when and to what degree contractions in these industries may occur; however, any sharp or prolonged contraction in one or more of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Recently, we have undertaken internal reorganizations designed to improve operational efficiencies, enhance our ability to pursue market opportunities and accelerate our technology development initiatives.
We are currently reorganizing certain aspects of our sales and marketing operations to orient our coverage around customer accounts.
By virtue of our holdings of cash, investment securities and foreign currency derivatives, we have exposure to many different counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks and investment banks.
Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default of our counterparties.
We continue to monitor the stability of the financial markets, particularly those in the emerging markets.
We can give no assurance that we will not be negatively impacted by any adverse outcomes in those markets.
We Have Established a Budget and Variations From Our Budget Will Affect Our Financial Results.
We have an operating budget for 2018.
If demand for our products during the remainder of 2018 is less than the demand we anticipated in setting our 2018 budget, our operating results could be negatively impacted.
We Operate in Intensely Competitive Markets.
The markets in which we operate are characterized by intense competition from numerous competitors, some of which are divisions of large corporations having far greater resources than we have, and we may face further competition from new market entrants in the future.
A key competitor is Keysight Technologies Inc. (“Keysight”) which was part of Agilent until November 2014.
Keysight offers hardware and software products that provide solutions that directly compete with our virtual instrumentation products including its own line of PXI based hardware.
Keysight is aggressively advertising and marketing products that are competitive with our products.
Because of Keysight’s strong position in the instrumentation business, changes in its marketing strategy or product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.
Our Revenues are Subject to Seasonal Variations.
In previous years, our revenues have been characterized by seasonality, with revenues typically growing from the first quarter to the second quarter, being relatively constant from the second quarter to the third quarter, growing in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter and declining in the first quarter of the following year from the fourth quarter of the preceding year.
We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements using prescribed recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on our tax returns.
There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any future examinations.
If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Our tax years 2009 through 2017 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject.
Tax Law Changes in Hungary Could Have a Negative Impact on our Effective Tax Rate, Earnings and Results of Operations.
In addition, effective January 1, 2010, certain qualified research and development expenses in Hungary became eligible for an enhanced tax deduction.
These tax benefits may not be available in future years due to changes in political conditions in Hungary or changes in tax laws in Hungary or in the U.S.
The reduction or elimination of these benefits in Hungary could result in an increase in our future effective income tax rate which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
(See “Note 9 – Income taxes” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the impact of these matters on our income taxes).
Our Income Tax Rate could be Adversely Affected by the Expiration of a Tax Holiday in Malaysia.
Profits from our manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia are free of tax under a 15 year tax holiday effective January 1, 2013.
If we fail to satisfy the conditions of the tax holiday, this tax benefit may be terminated early.

Our Business is Dependent on Key Suppliers and Distributors and Disruptions in these Businesses Could Adversely Affect our Business and Results of Operations.
Our manufacturing processes use large volumes of high-quality components and subassemblies supplied by outside sources.
Several of these items are only available through limited sources.
Limited source items purchased include custom ASICs, chassis and other components.
We have in the past experienced delays and quality problems in connection with limited source items, and there can be no assurance that these problems will not recur in the future.
In some countries, we use distributors to support our sales channels.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, supply shortages of components used in our products, including limited source components, can result in significant additional costs and inefficiencies in manufacturing.
We Rely on Management Information Systems and Interruptions in our Information Technology Systems or Cyber-Attacks on our Systems Could Adversely Affect our Business.
We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business.
We rely on a primary global center for our management information systems and on multiple systems in branches not covered by our global center.
As with any information system, unforeseen issues may arise that could affect our ability to receive adequate, accurate and timely financial information, which in turn could inhibit effective and timely decisions.
Furthermore, it is possible that our global center for information systems or our branch operations could experience a complete or partial shutdown.
A significant system or network disruption could be the result of new system implementations, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches, facility issues or energy blackouts.
Threats to our information technology security can take a variety of forms and individuals or groups of hackers or sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations, may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our infrastructure.
If we were to experience a shutdown, disruption or attack, it would adversely impact our product shipments and net sales, as order processing and product distribution are heavily dependent on our management information systems.
Such an interruption could also result in a loss of our intellectual property or the release of sensitive competitive information or partner, customer or employee personal data.
In addition, changing laws and regulations governing our responsibility to safeguard private data could result in a significant increase in operating or capital expenditures needed to comply with these new laws or regulations.
Accordingly, our operating results in such periods would be adversely impacted.
From time to time, we have experienced attempts to breach our security and attempts to introduce malicious software into our information technology systems; however, such attacks have not previously resulted in any material damage to us.
We are continually working to maintain reliable systems to control costs and improve our ability to deliver our products in our markets worldwide.
Our efforts include, but are not limited to the following: firewalls, antivirus protection, patches, log monitors, routine backups with offsite retention of storage media, system audits, data partitioning and routine password modifications.
Our internal information technology systems environment continues to evolve and our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace as new threats emerge.
No assurance can be given that our efforts to continue to enhance our systems will be successful.
We are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Website.
We devote significant resources to maintaining our website, ni.com, as a key marketing, sales and support tool and expect to continue to do so in the future.
Failure to properly maintain our website may interrupt normal operations, including our ability to provide quotes, process orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We host our website internally.
Any failure to successfully maintain our website or any significant downtime or outages affecting our website could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.
48



Our Products are Complex and May Contain Bugs or Errors.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, our software products or third-party operating systems on which our products are based often contain bugs or errors.
Our products operate in conjunction with third-party products and components across a broad ecosystem.
As has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future, our products, or products or components in conjunction with which they operate, may contain design flaws.
We Are Subject to the Risk of Product Liability Claims.
Our products are designed to provide information upon which users may rely.
Our products are also used in “real time” applications requiring extremely rapid and continuous processing and constant feedback.
Such applications give rise to the risk that a failure or interruption of the system or application could result in economic damage, bodily harm or property damage.
We attempt to assure the quality and accuracy of the processes contained in our products, and to limit our product liability exposure through contractual limitations on liability, limited warranties, express disclaimers and warnings as well as disclaimers contained in our “shrink wrap” and electronically displayed license agreements with end-users.
If our products contain errors that produce incorrect results on which users rely or cause failure or interruption of systems or processes, customer acceptance of our products could be adversely affected.
Although we maintain liability insurance for product liability matters, there can be no assurance that such insurance or the contractual limitations used by us to limit our liability will be sufficient to cover or limit any claims which may occur.
In recent years, we have completed several acquisitions.
Achieving the anticipated benefits of an acquisition depends upon whether the integration of the acquired business, products or technology is accomplished efficiently and effectively.
In addition, successful acquisitions generally require, among other things, integration of product offerings, manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and R&D efforts.
These difficulties can become more challenging due to the need to coordinate geographically separated organizations, the complexities of the technologies being integrated, and the necessities of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures.
The integration of operations following an acquisition also requires the dedication of management resources, which may distract attention from our day-to-day business and may disrupt key R&D, marketing or sales efforts.
Our inability to successfully integrate any of our acquisitions could harm our business.
Compliance With Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is Costly and Challenging.
As required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, this Form 10-Q contains our management’s certification of adequate disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2018.
Our most recent annual report on Form 10-K also contains a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting including an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.
Our most recent annual report on Form 10-K also contains an attestation and report by our external auditors with respect to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404.
While these assessments and reports did not reveal any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, compliance with Sections 302 and 404 is required for each future fiscal year end.
We expect that the ongoing compliance with Sections 302 and 404 will continue to be both very costly and very challenging and there can be no assurance that material weaknesses will not be identified in future periods.
Our success depends on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary rights relative to the technologies used in our principal products.
In monitoring and policing our intellectual property rights, we have been and may be required to spend significant resources.
49



Our Business Depends on the Continued Service of Our Key Management and Technical Personnel.
Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management, sales, marketing, research and development and operational personnel including Alex Davern, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and other members of our senior management and key technical personnel.
In connection with his promotion to Chief Executive Officer in January 2017, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Davern.
We have no other agreements providing for the employment of any of our key employees for any fixed term and our key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time.
We also believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled management, technical, marketing, research and development, and operational personnel with experience in managing large and rapidly changing companies, as well as training, motivating and supervising employees.
The market for hiring and retaining certain technical personnel, including software engineers, has become more competitive and intense in recent years.
Failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel, including software engineers or retain our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
We must comply with many different governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our operations in the U.S., Hungary, and Malaysia.
Although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations, our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines, suspension of production or a cessation of operations.
Any such environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations.
Any failure by us to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.
Provisions in Our Charter Documents and Delaware Law May Delay or Prevent an Acquisition of Us.
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors.
These provisions include a classified Board of Directors, prohibition of stockholder action by written consent, prohibition of stockholders to call special meetings and the requirement that the holders of at least 80% of our shares approve any business combination not otherwise approved by two-thirds of our Board of Directors.
Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.
In addition, our Board of Directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer.
