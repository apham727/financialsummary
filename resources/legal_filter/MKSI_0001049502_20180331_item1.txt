 provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company adopted this ASU during the three month period ended March 31, 2018.
The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This standard requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for all leases, with certain exceptions, on the balance sheet.

The Company is currently working at accumulating a complete population of leases from all of its locations.
The Company has selected a software repository to track all of its lease agreements and to assist in the reporting and disclosure requirements required by the standard.

This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017.
The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application.
The Company used the modified retrospective method upon adoption in the first quarter of 2018.
The FASB issued additional updates to the new revenue standard in Topic 606 relating to reporting revenue on a gross versus net basis (Update 2016-08 in March 2016), identifying performance obligations and licensing arrangements (Update 2016-10 in April 2016), narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients (Update 2016-12 in May 2016), technical corrections and improvements (Update 2016-20 in December 2016), and SEC Updates (Update 2017-13 in September 2017 and Update 2017-14 in November 2017).
The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements as described further in Note 3.
3) Revenue from Contracts with Customers  



The Company adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.
The reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 reflect the application of ASC 606 guidance while the reported results for 2017 were prepared under the guidance of ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605).
The Company has recorded a net increase to opening retained earnings of $1,809 as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 606, with the impact primarily related to its service business and certain custom products.
The impact to revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was immaterial as a result of applying ASC 606.
The adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the delivery of the Companys goods or services and will provide financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures.
To achieve this core principle, the Company applies the following five steps:  



      Identify the contract with a customer  



      Identify the performance obligations in the contract  



8  



Table of Contents 



MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.  



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  



(in thousands, except share and per share data)  



      Determine the transaction price  



      Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract  



      Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation  



Revenue under ASC 606 is recognized when or as obligations under the terms of a contract with the Companys customer have been satisfied and control has transferred to the customer.
Installation services are not significant and are usually completed in a short period of time (normally less than two weeks) and therefore, recorded at a point in time when the installation services are completed, rather than over time as they are not material.
Extended warranty, service contracts, and repair services, which are transferred to the customer over time, are recorded as revenue as the services are performed.
For repair services, the Company makes an accrual at quarter end based upon historical repair times within its product groups to record revenue based upon the estimated number of days completed to date, which is consistent with ratable recognition.
The Company considers this to be a faithful depiction of the transfer to the customer of revenue over time as the work or service is performed.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the products or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the product or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.
Sales, value add, and other taxes the Company collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.
The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant.
For certain products or services and customer types, the Company requires payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.
None of the Companys contracts as of March 31, 2018 contain a significant financing component.
Contract assets as of January 1 and March 31, 2018 were immaterial and included in other current assets.
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations  



The Company periodically enters into contracts with its customers in which a customer may purchase a combination of goods and or services, such as products with installation services or extended warranty obligations.
These contracts include multiple promises that the Company evaluates to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations.
Once the Company determines the performance obligations, the Company then determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any.
To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the method the Company expects to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled.
There are no constraints on the variable consideration recorded.
The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative stand-alone selling price charged separately to customers or using an expected cost-plus-margin method.
The corresponding revenues are recognized when or as the related performance obligations are satisfied, which are noted above.
The impact of variable consideration was immaterial during the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Deferred Revenues  



The Companys standard assurance warranty period is normally 12 to 24 months.
The Company sells separately-priced service contracts and extended warranty contracts related to certain of its products, especially its laser products.
The separately priced contracts generally range from 12 to 60 months.
The Company normally receives payment at the inception of the contract and recognizes revenue over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the obligations under the contract.
The Company has elected to use the practical expedient related to disclosing the remaining performance obligations as of March 31, 2018, as the majority have a duration of less than one year.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The tables above, which show the gross unrealized gains and (losses) aggregated by investment category for available-for-sale investments as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, reflect the inclusion within short-term investments of investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of purchase.
Management has the ability, if necessary, to liquidate any of its investments in order to meet the Companys liquidity needs in the next 12 months.
Accordingly, those investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of purchase are classified as short-term on the accompanying balance sheets.
Dividend income is recognized as income on the date the stock trades ex-dividend. The cost of marketable securities sold is determined by the specific identification method.
5) Fair Value Measurements  



In accordance with the provisions of fair value accounting, a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability and defines fair value based upon an exit price model.
The fair value measurement guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
The guidance describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  



 Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities assessed as of the reporting date.
Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Level 2   Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments or securities or derivative contracts that are valued using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
12  



Table of Contents 



MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.  



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  



(in thousands, except share and per share data)  



 Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
In such cases, the Company categorizes such assets and liabilities based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
(2)  The long-term investments presented in the table above do not include the Companys minority interest investment in a private company, which is accounted for under the cost method.

Money Market Funds  



Money market funds are cash and cash equivalents and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Available-For-Sale Investments  



Available-for-sale investments consisted of time deposits and drafts, certificates of deposit, bankers acceptance drafts, asset-backed securities (which include auto loans, credit card receivables and equipment trust receivables), commercial paper, corporate obligations, municipal bonds, U.S. treasury obligations and U.S. agency obligations.
The Company measures its debt and equity investments at fair value.
The Companys available-for-sale investments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Israeli Pension Assets  



Israeli pension assets represent investments in mutual funds, government securities and other time deposits.
These investments are set aside for the retirement benefit of the employees at the Companys Israeli subsidiaries.
These funds are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The principal market in which the Company executes its foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps is the institutional market in an over-the-counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency.
The market participants usually are large commercial banks.
6) Derivatives  



The Company enters into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments and those utilized as economic hedges.
The Company has used derivative instruments, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, to manage certain foreign currency exposure, and interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure.
The Company enters into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions, for which no collateral is required.
The Company has policies to monitor the credit risk of these counterparties.
While there can be no assurance, the Company does not anticipate any material non-performance by any of these counterparties.
Interest Rate Swap Agreement  



On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix the rate on approximately 50% of its then-outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement, as described further in Note 10.
This hedge fixes the interest rate paid on the hedged debt at 1.198% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 2.00% as of March 31, 2018, through September 30, 2020.
To the extent that this arrangement is no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs.
The notional amount of this transaction was $305,000 and had a fair value of $8,170 at March 31, 2018.
The notional amount of this transaction was $305,000 and had a fair value of $6,179 at December 31, 2017.
Foreign Exchange Contracts  



The Company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency-denominated intercompany sales of inventory, over a maximum period of eighteen months, using forward foreign exchange contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges related to Japanese, South Korean, British, Euro and Taiwanese currencies.
To the extent these derivatives are effective in off-setting the variability of the  



15  



Table of Contents 



MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.  



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  



(in thousands, except share and per share data)  



 hedged cash flows, and otherwise meet the hedge accounting criteria, changes in the derivatives fair value are not included in current earnings but are included in OCI in stockholders equity.
These changes in fair value will subsequently be reclassified into earnings, as applicable, when the forecasted transaction occurs.
To the extent that a previously designated hedging transaction is no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs.
The cash flows resulting from forward exchange contracts are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows as part of cash flows from operating activities.
As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with gross notional values of $228,463 and $208,922, respectively.
The derivative liability of $(8,273) and $(6,198) as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 are classified in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
These foreign exchange contracts are subject to a master netting agreement with one financial institution.
The net amount of existing gains as of March 31, 2018 that the Company expects to reclassify from OCI into earnings within the next twelve months is immaterial.
(2)  Effective portion classified in cost of products for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



   (1)  The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge against changes in the balance sheet for certain subsidiaries to mitigate the risk associated with certain foreign currency transactions in the ordinary course of business.
This business, which had revenues in 2016 of $12,700 and was included in the Vacuum & Analysis segment, was no longer a part of the Companys long-term strategic objectives.
9) Goodwill and Intangible Assets  



Goodwill  



The Companys methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established and generally accepted valuation techniques.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed.
The Company assigns assets acquired (including goodwill) and liabilities assumed to one or more reporting units as of the date of acquisition.
17  



Table of Contents 



MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.  



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  



(in thousands, except share and per share data)  



Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill and accumulated impairment (loss) during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and year ended December 31, 2017 were as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



   (1)  In 2017, the Company sold its Data Analytics business and, as a result, charged the related goodwill of $(3,115) to the gain on sale of business.

 10) Debt  



Term Loan Credit Agreement  



In connection with the completion of the Companys acquisition of Newport Corporation (Newport) in April 2016 (the Newport Merger), the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders), that provided senior secured financing of $780,000, subject to increase at the Companys option in accordance with the Credit Agreement (the Term Loan Facility).
Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest per annum at one of the following rates selected by the Company: (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, (2) the prime rate quoted in The Wall Street Journal, (3) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00%, and (4) a floor of 1.75%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin; or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a LIBOR rate floor of 0.75%, plus an applicable margin.
The Company has elected the interest rate as described in clause (b).
The Credit Agreement provides that all loans will be determined by reference to the Base Rate if the LIBOR rate cannot be ascertained, if regulators impose material restrictions on the authority of a lender to make LIBOR rate loans, or for other reasons.
The Term Loan Facility was issued with original issue discount of 1.00% of the principal amount thereof.
On June 9, 2016, the Company entered into Amendment No.
1 (the Repricing Amendment 1) to the Credit Agreement by and among the Company, the Lenders and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders.
The Repricing Amendment 1 decreased the applicable margin for borrowings under the Companys Term Loan Facility to 2.50% for base rate borrowings and 3.50% for LIBOR borrowings and extended the period during which a prepayment premium may be required for a Repricing Transaction (as defined in the Credit Agreement) until six months after the effective date of the Repricing Amendment 1.
In connection with the execution of the Repricing Amendment 1, the Company paid a prepayment premium of 1.00%, or $7,300, as well as certain fees and expenses of the administrative agent and the Lenders, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Repricing Amendment 1, the Company prepaid $50,000 of principal under the Credit Agreement.
In September 2016, the Company prepaid an additional $60,000 under the Credit Agreement.
On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of September 30, 2020, to fix the rate on $335,000 of the then-outstanding balance of the Credit Agreement.
The rate is fixed at 1.198% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 2.00% at March 31, 2018.
The notional amount of this transaction was $305,000 and had a fair value of $8,170 at March 31, 2018.
On December 14, 2016, the Company entered into Amendment No.
2 (the Repricing Amendment 2) to the Credit Agreement by and among the Company, the Lenders and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders.
