Overview
Fiscal 2018 and 2017 each contains 52 weeks, and the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and 2017 each contained 39 weeks.
Investment in semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment and services continued to be a strong driver of revenue during the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Semiconductor equipment customers continued to make investments in new capacity and overall semiconductor systems revenue increased as compared to the same period in the prior year. Logic and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) demand increased, and NAND demand remained strong reflecting increasing memory requirements in smartphones and servers. Foundry customers’ spending decreased compared to the prior year and Applied continues to see these customers optimize existing capacity and re-prioritize their capital spending plans. Display equipment spending reflected continued investment in new technology and manufacturing equipment. Customers continue to invest in a new generation of equipment for producing larger LCD TVs and in new equipment for mobile devices.
The three and nine months ended July 29, 2018 included a one-time expense related to the enactment of recent U.S. tax legislation that reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.01 and $1.05, respectively.
Results of Operations
Net Sales
For the three and nine months ended July 29, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year, net sales increased primarily due to increased customer investments in all segments. The Semiconductor Systems segment’s relative share of total net sales continued to represent the largest contributor of net sales.
The changes in net sales in all regions in the three and nine months ended July 29, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily reflected changes in semiconductor equipment spending and customer mix, and increased spending in semiconductor spares and services. The increase in net sales to customers in China for the three and nine months ended July 29, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year, also reflected increased investments in display manufacturing equipment. The decrease in net sales to customers in Taiwan for the nine months ended July 29, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily reflected decreased investments in semiconductor equipment. The decrease in net sales to customers in Korea for the three months ended July 29, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily reflected decrease in investments in semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment. 
Gross Margin
While gross margin in the three months ended July 29, 2018 remained flat compared to the same period in the prior year, gross margin in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 increased compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the increase in net sales and materials cost savings.
Gross margin during the three months ended July 29, 2018 and July 30, 2017 included $22 million and $18 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively. Gross margin during the nine months ended July 29, 2018 and July 30, 2017 included $65 million and $51 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively. 
Research, Development and Engineering
Marketing and Selling
Marketing and selling expenses increased in the three and nine months ended July 29, 2018 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2017 primarily due to additional headcount. 
Marketing and selling expenses during the three months ended July 29, 2018 and July 30, 2017 each included $7 million of share-based compensation expense. Marketing and selling expenses during the nine months ended July 29, 2018 and July 30, 2017 included $23 million and $21 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively. 
General and Administrative
Interest Expense and Interest and Other Income (loss), net
Interest expenses incurred were primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes issued in June 2011, September 2015 and March 2017. Interest expense in the nine months ended July 29, 2018 increased compared to the same periods in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the issuance of senior unsecured notes in March 2017. 
Interest and other income, net in the three and nine months ended July 29, 2018 increased compared to the same periods in fiscal 2017 primarily driven by realized gains on sales of securities and higher interest income from investments.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was relatively flat compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The third quarter of fiscal 2018 included tax benefits from the resolution of tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, the lower U.S. federal corporate tax rate, and changes in the geographical composition of income. The third quarter of the prior fiscal year included tax benefits from the recognition of previously unrecognized foreign tax credits.
The effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was higher than the same period in the prior fiscal year. The first nine months of fiscal 2018 included tax expense of $1.1 billion for the transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets partially offset by tax benefits from the lower U.S. federal corporate tax rate, changes in the geographical composition of income, adoption of authoritative guidance for share-based compensation and the resolution of tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions. The first nine months of the prior fiscal year included tax benefits from the recognition of previously unrecognized foreign tax credits.
The results for each reportable segment are discussed below.
Semiconductor Systems Segment
Investment in semiconductor manufacturing equipment continued to be a strong driver of revenue during the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Semiconductor equipment customers continued to make investments in new capacity and overall semiconductor systems revenue increased as compared to the same period in the prior year. Demand for logic, DRAM, and NAND increased during the first nine months of fiscal 2018, although NAND demand decreased slightly in the three months ended July 29, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. Foundry customers’ spending decreased compared to the prior year and Applied continues to see these customers optimize existing capacity and re-prioritize their capital spending plans.
Applied Global Services Segment
The Applied Global Services segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, certain remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and solar products. Customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites.
Demand for Applied Global Services’ service solutions are driven by Applied’s large and growing installed base of manufacturing systems, and customers’ needs to shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield, and optimize factory output and operating costs. Industry conditions that affect Applied Global Services’ sales of spares and services are primarily characterized by increases in semiconductor manufacturers’ wafer starts and continued strong utilization rates, growth of the installed base of equipment, growing service intensity of newer tools, and the company’s ability to sell more comprehensive service agreements.
Net sales for the three and nine months ended July 29, 2018 increased compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to higher customer spending for spares and services. Operating income and operating margin for the three and nine months ended July 29, 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year increased due to higher net sales. In the three months ended July 29, 2018, two customers each accounted for more than 10 percent of this segment’s total net sales.
There was no region that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the Applied Global Services segment for any of the periods presented.
Display and Adjacent Markets Segment
The Display and Adjacent Markets segment encompasses products for manufacturing liquid crystal and OLED displays, and other display technologies for TVs, personal computers, electronic tablets, smart phones, and other consumer-oriented devices, equipment upgrades and flexible coating systems. The segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologically-differentiated equipment for manufacturing large-scale LCD TVs, OLEDs, low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), metal oxide, and touch panel sectors; and development of products that provide customers with improved performance and yields. Display industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for next generation mobile devices.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Operating Activities
Cash from operating activities for the nine months ended July 29, 2018 was $2.7 billion, which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of non-cash charges and changes in working capital components. Non-cash charges included depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and deferred income taxes. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and lower deferred revenue, partially offset by an increase in income taxes payable. 
Applied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers. Applied sells its accounts receivable without recourse. Applied, from time to time, also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions. The discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. Applied sold $1.0 billion and $360 million of accounts receivable during the nine months ended July 29, 2018 and July 30, 2017, respectively. Applied did not discount promissory notes or utilize programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers during the nine months ended July 29, 2018 or July 30, 2017.
Days sales outstanding for the three months ended July 29, 2018 was 59 days, an increase compared to day sales outstanding of 55 days for the same period in the prior year. Days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and payment terms, and the increase was primarily due to better revenue linearity for the same period in the prior year. 
Investing Activities
Applied generated $700 million of cash from investing activities during the nine months ended July 29, 2018. Proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled $1.2 billion and were partially offset by capital expenditures of $457 million during the nine months ended July 29, 2018.
Applied’s investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as equity securities. Applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies. During the nine months ended July 29, 2018, Applied did not recognize any impairment of its fixed income securities. As of July 29, 2018, gross unrealized losses related to Applied’s investment portfolio were not material.
Applied used $5.0 billion of cash in financing activities during the nine months ended July 29, 2018, consisting primarily of repurchases of common stock of $4.5 billion, tax withholding payments for vested equity awards of $160 million and cash dividends to stockholders of $410 million.
In June 2018, February 2018 and December 2017, Applied’s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.20, $0.20 and $0.10 per share, respectively. Applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applied’s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of Applied’s stockholders.
In fiscal 2011, Applied established a short-term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion. As of July 29, 2018, Applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future.
In March 2017, Applied issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2.2 billion. Applied had senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.4 billion outstanding as of July 29, 2018. The indentures governing these notes include covenants with which Applied was in compliance as of July 29, 2018. In May 2017, Applied completed the redemption of the entire outstanding $200 million in principal amount of senior notes due in October 2017. The redemption price was $205 million, and after adjusting for the carrying value of the debt issuance costs and discounts, Applied recorded a $5 million loss on the prepayment of the $200 million debt, which is included in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional discussion of long-term debt. Applied may seek to refinance its existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness depending on Applied’s capital requirements and the availability of financing.
Applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. As of July 29, 2018, Applied has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $150 million to cover these arrangements.
During the nine months ended July 29, 2018, Applied did not record a bad debt provision. While Applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts as of July 29, 2018 is adequate, it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions.
Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, Applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy Applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. For further details regarding Applied’s operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows in this report.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Revenue Recognition
Warranty Costs
Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. As Applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs differ substantially from Applied’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues Applied has identified. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to Applied or its payment trends, may require Applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to Applied, which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Inventory Valuation
Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. 
To test goodwill for impairment, Applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, Applied then performs the two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. Under the two-step goodwill impairment test, Applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, Applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If Applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, Applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference.
Applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach. Applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Under the income approach, Applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method.
The estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that Applied uses to manage its business, and considers any significant developments during the period. Under the discounted cash flow method, cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate, which considers the long-term earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units. The estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit’s target capital structure. In addition, the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics, and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows. The tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects Applied’s current international structure, which is consistent with the market participant perspective. Under the market approach, Applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publicly-traded companies and considers each reporting unit’s size, growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies. 
Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Results
