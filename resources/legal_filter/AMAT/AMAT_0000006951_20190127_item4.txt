Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, Applied implemented controls and processes relating to adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard that the Company adopted in the beginning of fiscal 2019. Throughout the implementation, Applied evaluated the impact of the adoption of the new standard on its internal control over financial reporting and made changes to controls where necessary to maintain the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in all material respects. There were no other changes in the internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Appliedâ€™s internal control over financial reporting.
