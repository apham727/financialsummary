Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Applied implemented a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for certain of its business units, subsidiaries and locations. The ERP system replaces a legacy manufacturing system, automates and streamlines the consolidation process and enhances reporting capabilities. Throughout the implementation, Applied evaluated the impact of the ERP system on its internal control over financial reporting and made changes to controls where necessary to maintain the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in all material respects.
