Note 1.
Basis of Presentation



Basis of Presentation



The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Juniper Networks, Inc. (the “Company” or “Juniper”) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
GAAP”) for interim financial information.
The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017 has been derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements at that date.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, including normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.
The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
2016-18 (Topic 230) Statement of Cash Flow: Restricted Cash, effective January 1, 2018, using the retrospective transition method.
Restricted cash of $47.4 million and $54.2 million has been included within cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash when reconciling the beginning and ending total amounts, respectively, on the statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, to conform to the current period presentation.
The adoption did not have a material impact on the cash flow activity presented on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
See Note 3, Cash Equivalents and Investments, for a reconciliation of the cash balances within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



Except for the change in certain policies upon adoption of the accounting standards described below, there have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies, compared to the accounting policies described in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of the Form 10-K.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards



Comprehensive Income: Effective January 1, 2018, the Company early adopted FASB ASU No.
The adoption resulted in a reclassification of $5.7 million in income from accumulated other comprehensive loss to accumulated deficit as of the adoption date.
The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
Financial Instruments: On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted FASB ASU No.
2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities and FASB ASU No.
2018-03, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Financial Instruments - Overall, which changes how entities classify and measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option.
The guidance also updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for its equity securities with readily determinable fair values and the prospective method for its equity securities without readily determinable fair values, resulting in no impact to the opening accumulated deficit balance.
The Company has elected to use the measurement alternative for its equity investments without readily determinable fair value, defined as cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment.
See Note 3, Cash Equivalents and Investments for additional disclosures required upon adopting the standard.
Revenue Recognition: On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted FASB ASU No.
2014-09 (Topic 606) - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09” or "Topic 606"), which provides guidance for revenue recognition that superseded the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ("Topic 605") and most industry specific guidance.
Under ASU 2014-09, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 under the modified retrospective approach, applying the amendments to prospective reporting periods.
Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the historic accounting under Topic 605.

The cumulative effect of the changes made to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2018 for the adoption of Topic 606 to all contracts with customers that were not completed as of December 31, 2017 was recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the adoption date as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $324.7 million, net of tax adjustment of $63.9 million, which decreased the January 1, 2018 opening accumulated deficit balance on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily as a result of the following items:



•Distributor Sales: Under Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue from sales to distributors upon delivery of the product to the distributor, rather than upon delivery of the product to the end customer.
•Software Revenue: Under Topic 605, the Company deferred revenue for software licenses where vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value had not been established for undelivered items (primarily services).
•Variable Consideration: Some of the Company's contracts include penalties, extended payment terms, acceptance provisions or other price variability that precluded revenue recognition under Topic 605 because of the requirement for amounts to be fixed or determinable.
Topic 606 requires the Company to estimate and account for variable consideration as a reduction of the transaction price.
•Revenue Allocation: Similar to Topic 605, Topic 606 requires an allocation of revenue between deliverables, or performance obligations, within an arrangement.
Topic 605 restricted the allocation of revenue that is contingent on future deliverables to current deliverables; however, Topic 606 removes this restriction.
In addition, the nature of the performance obligations identified within a contract under Topic 606 as compared to Topic 605 will impact the allocation of the transaction price between product and services.
•Contract Acquisition Costs: Topic 606 requires the deferral and amortization of “incremental” costs incurred to obtain a contract where the associated contract duration is greater than one year.
The primary contract acquisition cost for the Company are sales commissions.
Prior to January 1, 2018, the Company expensed sales commissions.
The change required by Topic 606 resulted in the creation of an asset on January 1, 2018.

Revenue Recognition



Revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price, and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation, as further described below.
Identify the contract with a customer.
The Company generally considers a sales contract or agreement with an approved purchase order as a customer contract provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances.
The Company combines contracts with a customer if contracts are negotiated with a single commercial substance or contain price dependencies.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
Product performance obligations include hardware and software licenses and service performance obligations include maintenance, software post-contract support, training, and professional services.
Certain software licenses and related post-contract support are combined into a single performance obligation when the maintenance updates are critical to the continued functionality of the software.
Determine the transaction price.
The Company generally invoices customers for hardware, software licenses and related maintenance arrangements at time of delivery, and professional services either upfront or upon meeting certain milestones.
Customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance.
The Company’s contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis.
Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
Revenue for maintenance and software post-contract support is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term.
Revenue from training and professional services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less.

The Company's Level 2 available-for-sale debt securities are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or non-binding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data.
The Company's derivative instruments are classified as Level 2, as they are not actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs.
The Company's policy is to recognize asset or liability transfers among Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 at the beginning of the quarter in which a change in circumstances resulted in a transfer.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company had no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy of its assets or liabilities measured at fair value.
All of the Company's privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock securities are classified as Level 3 assets due to the lack of observable inputs to determine fair value.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, there were no significant activities related to privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stocks securities.
There were no impairment charges recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018.
Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at fair value, when they are deemed to be impaired or when there is an adjustment from observable price changes.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, there were no impairment charges or adjustments resulting from observable price changes for equity investments without readily determinable fair value.
As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had no liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of the Company's short-term and long-term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was $2,168.4 million and $2,252.9 million, respectively, based on observable market inputs (Level 2).
The carrying value of the promissory note issued to the Company in connection with the previously completed sale of Junos Pulse (the “Pulse Note”), along with the accumulated interest paid in kind, of $64.6 million and $61.2 million approximates its fair value as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
The Pulse Note is classified as a Level 3 asset due to the lack of observable inputs to determine fair value.

As a result, the Company may make adjustments to the provisional amounts which may materially impact its provision for income taxes from continuing operations in the period in which the adjustments are made.
Due to the complexities of the new provisions and the anticipated regulations referenced above, the Company is continuing to evaluate how the provisions will be accounted for under U.S. GAAP.
The Company has not currently elected a method and will do so after completing its analysis of the GILTI provisions of the Tax Act depending on the analysis of the Company’s global income.
The Company has, however, included an estimate of the current GILTI impact in its annual effective tax rate for 2018.
The Company expects to complete the accounting during the measurement period.
As of September 30, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $205.0 million, of which $183.3 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers 



In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and in the interest of having access to adequate component supply, the Company enters into agreements with contract manufacturers and certain suppliers to procure inventory based on the Company's requirements.
A significant portion of the Company's purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm and non-cancelable commitments.
These purchase commitments totaled $610.9 million as of September 30, 2018.
The Company establishes a liability in connection with purchase commitments related to quantities in excess of its demand forecasts or obsolete materials charges for components purchased by the contract manufacturers based on the Company’s demand forecast or customer orders.
As of September 30, 2018, the Company had accrued $23.6 million based on its estimate of such charges.
As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $12.0 million and $20.4 million, respectively, for such indemnification obligations in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In cooperation with these investigations, the Company and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, with the assistance of outside counsel and other independent advisors, conducted a thorough internal investigation.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the DOJ notified the Company that the DOJ has closed its investigation related to these matters without taking any action against the Company.
The Company is continuing to fully cooperate with the SEC’s ongoing investigation, and based on the Company’s recent communications with the Staff of the SEC, the Company believes that it is likely that the Staff of the SEC will seek to bring an enforcement action against the Company.
