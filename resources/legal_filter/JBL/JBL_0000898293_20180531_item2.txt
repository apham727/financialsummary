Overview  
We are one of the leading providers of worldwide manufacturing services and solutions. We provide comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services to companies in the automotive and transportation, capital equipment, consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies, computing and storage, defense and aerospace, digital home, healthcare, industrial and energy, mobility, networking and telecommunications, packaging, point of sale and printing industries. Our services enable our customers to reduce manufacturing costs, improve supply-chain management, reduce inventory obsolescence, lower transportation costs and reduce product fulfillment time. Our manufacturing and supply chain management services and solutions include innovation, design, planning, fabrication and assembly, delivery and managing the flow of resources and products.  
We serve our customers primarily through dedicated business units that combine highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing with advanced electronic design and design for manufacturability. We depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue, which in turn depends upon their growth, viability and financial stability. Based on net revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, our largest customers include Apple, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., GoPro, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, LM Ericsson Telephone Company, NetApp, Inc., Nokia Networks, SolarEdge Technologies, Inc., Valeo S.A. and Zebra Technologies Corporation.  
In September 2017, our operations in Cayey, Puerto Rico received significant hurricane damage. During the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2018, we recognized $(0.6) million and $10.7 million of expenses, net of insurance proceeds of $5.0 million and $21.4 million, respectively. As we continue to assess the impact to our operations, we may incur additional costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. We also expect the majority of these costs will ultimately be offset by insurance coverage.

Summary of Results  
Key Performance Indicators  
 (1)  The sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less the days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators.  
 (3)  During the three months ended May 31, 2018, the decrease in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the quarter. During the three months ended November 30, 2017, the increase in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to higher materials purchases during the quarter due to increased demand in the mobility business as well as the timing of purchases and cash payments from purchases during the quarter.

Gross Profit  
Gross profit increased during the three months ended May 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2017 primarily due to the increase in net revenue.  
Selling, General and Administrative  
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased during the three months ended May 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in salary and salary related expenses and other costs to support business growth and development.  
Table of Contents 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased during the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2017. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we recognized an additional $32.4 million of stock-based compensation expense due to the modification of certain performance-based restricted stock awards and a one-time cash-settled award while the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 included a $21.0 million reversal of stock-based compensation expense due to decreased expectations for the vesting of certain performance-based restricted stock awards. The remaining increase is primarily driven by an increase in salary and salary related expenses and other costs to support business growth and development.  
Research and Development  
Research and development expenses during the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared to the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2017, respectively, remained relatively consistent as a percent of net revenue.  
Amortization of intangibles increased during the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared to the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2017, primarily due to amortization from intangible assets related to the True-Tech acquisition that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.  
Restructuring and Related Charges  
 (1)  Includes $4.6 million and $12.4 million recorded in the EMS segment, $5.8 million and $17.8 million recorded in the DMS segment and $2.2 million and $2.5 million of non-allocated charges for the three months ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Includes $12.6 million and $23.8 million recorded in the EMS segment, $13.8 million and $65.8 million recorded in the DMS segment and $3.1 million and $23.9 million of non-allocated charges for the nine ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

 (2)  Primarily relates to the 2017 Restructuring Plan.  
On September 15, 2016, our Board of Directors formally approved a restructuring plan to better align our global capacity and administrative support infrastructure to further optimize organizational effectiveness. This action includes headcount reductions across our selling, general and administrative cost base and capacity realignment in higher cost locations (the 2017 Restructuring Plan).

Other Expense  
Other expense decreased for the three months ended May 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2017, primarily due to an other than temporary impairment on available for sale securities of $11.5 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in fees of $4.7 million associated with the asset-backed securitization programs and trade accounts receivable sale programs during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018.  
Other expense increased for the nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in fees associated with the asset-backed securitization programs and the new trade accounts receivable sale programs. Additionally, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 we incurred costs of $2.6 million in connection with a make-whole premium and related costs for the early redemption of the 8.250% Senior Notes due 2018. The increase was partially offset by an other then temporary impairment on available for sale securities during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.  
Interest Income  
Interest income increased during the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared to the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2017, due to increased investments.  
Interest Expense  
Interest expense increased during the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2018, compared to the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2017, due to additional borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility and higher interest rates.  
Table of Contents 
The effective tax rate increased for the three months ended May 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended May 31, 2017, primarily due to (i) increased income in jurisdictions with low tax rates and (ii) the overall loss for the three months ended May 31, 2017, despite having income in certain high tax-rate jurisdictions.

 (3)  On April 19, 2018, the program was extended to September 28, 2018.  
In connection with our asset-backed securitization programs, as of May 31, 2018, we sold $1.1 billion of eligible trade accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total sold outstanding receivables at that date. In exchange, we received cash proceeds of $600.6 million and recorded a deferred purchase price receivable of $529.6 million.

Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs  
 (2)  Any party may elect to terminate the agreement upon 15 days prior notice.  
 (3)  On May 4, 2018, the program was extended to May 4, 2023.  
During the three months and nine months ended May 31, 2018, we sold $1.3 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, of trade accounts receivable under these programs and we received cash proceeds of $1.3 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. As of May 31, 2018, we had up to $353.8 million in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable sale programs.  
Capital Expenditures  
Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was primarily due to non-cash expenses and higher accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by higher inventories, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily due to an increase in materials purchases due to increased demand in the mobility business and the timing of purchases and cash payments. The increase in inventories supports expected sales levels and also is due to increased demand and advance purchases in anticipation of a materials shortage. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily driven by the timing of sales and cash collections activity as well as higher sales levels. The increase in prepaid expense and other current assets is primarily due to an increase in value added tax receivables, partially offset by a decrease in deferred purchase price receivables from a decrease in receivables sold and the timing of cash collections.
