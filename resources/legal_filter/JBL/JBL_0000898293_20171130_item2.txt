We serve our customers primarily through dedicated business units that combine highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing with advanced electronic design and design for manufacturability. We depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue, which in turn depends upon their growth, viability and financial stability. Based on net revenue, for the three months ended November 30, 2017, our largest customers include Apple, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., GoPro, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, Ingenico S.A., LM Ericsson Telephone Company, NetApp, Inc., SolarEdge Technologies, Inc., Valeo S.A. and Zebra Technologies Corporation.  
Summary of Results  
Key Performance Indicators  
 (1)  The sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less the days in accounts payable; accordingly, the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators.  
 (2)  During the three months ended August 31, 2017, the decrease in days in accounts receivable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the timing of sales and collections activity.  
 (3)  During the three months ended November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, the increase in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to higher materials purchases during the quarter due to increased demand in the mobility business as well as the timing of purchases and cash payments from purchases during the quarter. During the three months ended May 31, 2017, the increase in days in accounts payable from the prior sequential quarter was primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments from purchases during the quarter.  
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
See Note 13  New Accounting Guidance to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance.  
The Three Months Ended November 30, 2017 compared to the Three Months Ended November 30, 2016  
Net Revenue. Net revenue increased 9.4% to $5.6 billion during the three months ended November 30, 2017, compared to $5.1 billion during the three months ended November 30, 2016. Specifically, the DMS segment revenues increased 13% due to a 12% increase in revenues from customers within our mobility business as a result of increased end user product demand and a 1% increase in revenues due to new business from existing customers in our healthcare and packaging businesses. EMS segment revenues increased 6% primarily due to a 2% increase in revenues from customers within our digital home business, a 2% increase in revenues from customers within our industrial and energy business, a 1% increase in revenues from customers in our automotive and transportation business and a 1% increase spread across various industries within the EMS segment.  
Foreign source revenue represented 92.3% of our net revenue for the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016.  
Gross Profit. Gross profit of $469.3 million (8.4% of net revenue) during the three months ended November 30, 2017, compared to $431.5 million (8.5% of net revenue) during the three months ended November 30, 2016, was relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue.  
Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $293.1 million (5.2% of net revenue) during the three months ended November 30, 2017, compared to $214.1 million (4.2% of net revenue) during the three months ended November 30, 2016. During the three months ended November 30, 2017, we recognized an additional $32.4 million of stock-based compensation expense due to the modification of certain performance-based restricted stock awards and a one-time cash-settled award while the three months ended November 30, 2016 included a $21.0 million reversal of stock-based compensation expense due to decreased expectations for the vesting of certain performance-based restricted stock awards. The remaining increase is primarily driven by an increase in salary and salary related expenses and other costs to support business growth and development.  
Research and Development. Research and development expenses remained relatively consistent at $9.1 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the three months ended November 30, 2017, compared to $7.6 million (0.2% of net revenue) during the three months ended November 30, 2016.  
Amortization of Intangibles. Amortization of intangibles increased to $10.0 million during the three months ended November 30, 2017, compared to $8.3 million during the three months ended November 30, 2016, primarily due to amortization from intangible assets related to the Lewis Engineering and True-Tech acquisitions that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, respectively.  
Restructuring and Related Charges.  
 (1) Includes $5.9 million and $7.4 million recorded in the EMS segment, $4.6 million and $11.5 million recorded in the DMS segment and $0.9 million and $17.0 million of non-allocated charges for the three months ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Except for asset write-off costs, all restructuring and related charges are cash costs.  
 (2)  Primarily relates to the 2017 Restructuring Plan.  
On September 15, 2016, our Board of Directors formally approved a restructuring plan to better align our global capacity and administrative support infrastructure to further optimize organizational effectiveness. This action includes headcount reductions across our Selling, General and Administrative cost base and capacity realignment in higher cost locations (the 2017 Restructuring Plan).  
Upon completion of the 2017 Restructuring Plan, we expect to recognize approximately $195.0 million in restructuring and related charges. We have incurred $164.6 million of costs-to-date as of November 30, 2017. The remaining costs for employee severance and benefits costs, asset write-off costs and other related costs are anticipated to be incurred during the remainder of fiscal year 2018.  
See Note 11  Restructuring and Related Charges to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of restructuring and related charges for the 2017 Restructuring Plan.  
Other Expense. Other expense increased to $5.9 million for the three months ended November 30, 2017 compared to $4.7 million for the three months ended November 30, 2016. The increase is primarily due to an increase in fees associated with the asset-backed securitization programs. Additionally, we recognized a loss in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 for a cost method investment.  
Interest Income. Interest income increased to $3.8 million during the three months ended November 30, 2017, compared to $2.5 million during the three months ended November 30, 2016, due to increased investments.  
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $36.2 million during the three months ended November 30, 2017, compared to $32.8 million during the three months ended November 30, 2016, due to additional borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility and higher interest rates.  
Non-GAAP (Core) Financial Measures  
Management believes that the non-GAAP core financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition costs and certain purchase accounting adjustments, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, business interruption and impairment charges, net, other than temporary impairment on securities, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Among other uses, management uses non-GAAP core financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when evaluating incentive compensation.  
 (1)  Charges, net of insurance proceeds of $10.3 million, relate to business interruptions and asset impairment costs associated with damage from Hurricane Maria, which impacted our operations in Cayey, Puerto Rico.  
Acquisitions and Expansion  
Seasonality  
We believe that our level of liquidity sources, which includes available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, additional proceeds available under our asset-backed securitization programs and under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs, cash on hand, funds provided by operations and the access to the capital markets, will be adequate to fund our capital expenditures, the payment of any declared quarterly dividends, share repurchases, any potential acquisitions and our working capital requirements for the next 12 months.  
 (1) We believe that our cash on hand and available borrowing under our credit facilities will be adequate to fund the payment of the 8.250% Senior Notes. However, we anticipate that we will enter into a new borrowing agreement to repay our 8.250% Senior Notes prior to maturity.  
During the three months ended November 30, 2017, the interest rates on the Revolving Credit Facility borrowings ranged from 2.4% to 4.4% and the interest rates on the Term Loan Facility ranged from 2.6% to 2.7%.  
Currently, we have a shelf registration statement with the SEC registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future to augment our liquidity and capital resources.  
Our Senior Notes and our Credit Facility contain various financial and nonfinancial covenants. A violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the notes payable and credit facilities and potentially causing acceleration of amounts due under these notes payable and credit facilities. As of November 30, 2017 and August 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants under our Senior Notes and Credit Facility. Refer to Note 6  Notes Payable, Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.  
Asset-Backed Securitization and Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs  
 (2)  On November 9, 2017, the program was extended to October 20, 2020.  
In connection with our asset-backed securitization programs, as of November 30, 2017, we sold $1.4 billion of eligible trade accounts receivable, which represents the face amount of total sold outstanding receivables at that date. In exchange, we received cash proceeds of $602.0 million and recorded a deferred purchase price receivable of $760.0 million. As of November 30, 2017, we had up to $0.1 million in available liquidity under our asset-backed securitization programs.  
Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs   
 (2)  The maximum amount under the program will be reduced to $650.0 million on February 1, 2018.  
During the three months ended November 30, 2017, we sold $1.1 billion of trade accounts receivable under these programs and we received cash proceeds of $1.1 billion. As of November 30, 2017, we had up to $543.9 million in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable sale programs.  
Capital Expenditures  
The following table sets forth selected consolidated cash flow information during the three months ended November 30, 2017  
Net cash used in operating activities during the three months ended November 30, 2017 was primarily due to higher inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts receivable, partially offset by higher accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. The increase in inventories supports expected sales levels in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and also is due to increased demand. The increase in prepaid expense and other current assets is primarily due to an increase in deferred purchase price receivables from an increase in receivables sold and the timing of cash collections and an increase in the value added tax receivables. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily driven by the timing of sales and cash collections activity as well as higher sales levels. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures and materials purchases due to increased demand in the mobility business and the timing of purchases and cash payments.  
Dividends and Share Repurchases  
In July 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $450.0 million of our common stock. The 2017 Share Repurchase Program expires on August 31, 2018. As of November 30, 2017, 3.2 million shares had been repurchased for $93.2 million and $356.7 million remains available under the 2017 Share Repurchase Program.  
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds  
The following table provides information relating to our repurchase of common stock during the three months ended  
 (1) The purchases include amounts that are attributable to shares surrendered to us by employees to satisfy, in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and the exercise of stock appreciation rights, their tax withholding obligations.  
 (2) In July 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $450.0 million of our common stock as publicly announced in a press release issued on July 20, 2017. The share repurchase program expires on August 31, 2018.
