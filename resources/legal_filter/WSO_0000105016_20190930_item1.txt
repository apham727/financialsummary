BASIS OF PRESENTATION   



Basis of Consolidation  



Watsco, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, “Watsco,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in Florida in 1956 and is the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies (“HVAC/R”) in the HVAC/R distribution industry in North America.
The accompanying September 30, 2019 interim condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements included herein.
The condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements contained in this report include the accounts of Watsco, all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and the accounts of three joint ventures with Carrier Corporation (“Carrier”), in each of which Watsco maintains a controlling interest.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Sales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment, and parts and supplies are seasonal.
Furthermore, results of operations can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on weather patterns, primarily during the Summer and Winter selling seasons.
Significant estimates include valuation reserves for accounts receivable, inventories and income taxes, reserves related to loss contingencies and the valuation of goodwill, indefinite



-lived intangible assets and long-lived intangible assets.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  



Leases  



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance on accounting for leases, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
In July 2018, the FASB issued updated guidance that provides an additional transition method of adoption that allows entities to initially apply the standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
The adoption of this standard and its related amendments (collectively, the “New Lease Standard”) on January 1, 2019 did not result in the recognition of a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings under the additional transition method, nor did it have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of income or cash flows.
See Note 2.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted  



Intangibles—Goodwill and Other  



In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
Under this updated standard, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
This guidance is effective prospectively and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted.

LEASES   



Adoption of New Lease Standard  



We adopted the New Lease Standard on January 1, 2019 using the additional transition method described in Note 1 to these condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements.
Results for reporting periods beginning on and after January 1, 2019 are presented under the New Lease Standard.
Prior periods have not been restated.
The New Lease Standard had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of 



right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities for operating leases, while accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged.
Practical Expedients  



We elected the package of practical expedients 



that did not require us to reassess (1) whether existing contracts contain embedded leases, (2) the lease classification of existing leases, and (3) whether initial direct costs for existing leases would qualify for capitalization under the New Lease Standard.
We also elected the practical expedients related to short-term leases and separating lease components from 



non-lease components for all underlying asset classes.
Operating and Finance Leases  



We have operating leases for real property, vehicles and equipment, and finance leases primarily for vehicles.
Operating leases are included in operating lease 



right-of-use assets, current portion of long-term obligations, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
Finance lease ROU assets at September 30, 2019 of $2,960 are included in property and equipment, net in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet.
Finance lease liabilities at September 30, 2019 of $3,047 are included in current portion of 



other long-term obligations and other long-term obligations, net of current portion in our condensed consolidated unaudited balance sheet.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement dates of the respective leases in determining the present value of the applicable lease payments.
Operating lease ROU assets also include any lease 



pre-payments made and exclude lease incentives.
Certain of our leases include variable payments, which are excluded from lease ROU assets and lease liabilities and



 expensed as incurred.
Our leases have remaining lease terms of 



1-10 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to five years.
Certain real property lease agreements have lease and 



non-lease components, which are generally accounted for as a single lease component.
Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease payments for short-term leases, which are 12 months or less without a purchase option that is likely to be exercised, are recognized as lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The components of operating lease expense were as follows:

At September 30, 2019, maturities of operating lease liabilities over each of the next five years and thereafter were as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



At September 30, 2019, we had additional operating leases, primarily for real property, that had not yet commenced.
Such leases had estimated future minimum rental commitments of approximately $1,600.
These operating leases 



subsequently commence



d



on Octob



er 1,



 2019 with lease terms of 



five years.
These undiscounted amounts are not included in the table above.
Prior to the adoption of the New Lease Standard, rental commitments on an undiscounted basis were approximately $219,300 at December 31, 2018 under 



non-cancelable operating leases and were payable as follows: $70,400 in 2019, $55,100 in 2020, $41,300 in 2021, $28,500 in 2022, $15,700 in 2023, and $8,300 thereafter.

INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY



On June 21, 2017, our first joint vent



ure with Carrier, Carrier Enterprise, LLC, which we refer to as Carrier Enterprise I, acquired a 34.9% ownership interest in Russell Sigler, Inc. (“RSI”), an HVAC distributor operating from 30 locations in the Western U.S. We have an 80% controlling interest in Carrier Enterprise I, and Carrier has a 20% 



non-controlling interest.
Carrier Enterprise I acquired its ownership interest in RSI for cash consideration of $63,600, of which we contributed $50,880 and Carrier contributed $12,720.
This acquisition increased Carrier Enterprise I’s ownership interest in RSI to 38.1%.
Carrier Enterprise I is a party to a 



shareholders’



agreement (the “Shareholders



’



 Agreement”) with RSI and its shareholders.
Pursuant to the Shareholders



’



 Agreement, RSI’s shareholders have the right to sell, and Carrier Enterprise I has the obligation to purchase, their respective shares of RSI for a purchase price determined based on either book value or a multiple of EBIT, the latter of which Carrier Enterprise I used to calculate the price paid for its investment in RSI.
Additionally, Carrier Enterprise I has the right to appoint two of RSI’s six board members.
Given Carrier Enterprise I’s 38.1​​​​​​​



% voting equity interest in RSI and its right to appoint 



two 



out of RSI’s 



six 



board members, this investment in RSI is accounted for under the equity method.

ACQUISITION



S



On April 2, 2019, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Dunphey & Associates Supply Co., Inc., a distributor of air conditioning and heating products operating from seven locations in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut.
The purchase price was composed of cash consideration of $16,781 and the issuance of 50,952 shares of Common stock having a fair value of $7,450.
On August 1, 2019, Carrier Enterprise I acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Peirce-Phelps, Inc. (“PPI”), an HVAC distributor operating from 19 locations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, for $85,000 less certain average revolving indebtedness.
Consideration for the net purchase price consisted of $10,000 in cash



, 372,543 shares of Common stock having a fair value of $58,638



and the payment of certain average revolving indebtedness



.
Carrier contributed cash of $17,000 to Carrier Enterprise I in connection with the acquisition of PPI.

DERIVATIVES



We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the earnings impact that foreign exchange rate fluctuations would otherwise have on certain monetary liabilities that are denominated in nonfunctional currencies.
Cash Flow Hedging Instruments 



We enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges.
The settlement of these derivatives results in reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings for the period in which the settlement of these instruments occurs.
The maximum period for which we hedge our cash flow using these instruments is 



12 months.
Accordingly, at September 30, 2019, all our open foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of 



one year or less.
The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at September 30, 2019 was $40,400, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through June 2020.
The impact from foreign exchange derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges was as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



At September 30, 2019, we expected an estimated $385 



pre-tax 



loss to be reclassified into earnings to reflect the fixed prices obtained from foreign exchange hedging within the next 12 months.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 



We have also entered into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are either not designated as hedges or did not qualify for hedge accounting.
These derivative instruments were effective economic hedges for all the periods presented.
The total notional value of our foreign currency exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments at September 30, 2019 was $12,300, and such contracts have varying terms expiring through November 2019.
We recognized 



gains



 (losses



) of $128 and $



(108



) from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the quarters ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We recognized losses of $175 and $299 from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments in our condensed consolidated unaudited statements of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Self-Insurance  



Self-insurance reserves are maintained relative to company-wide casualty insurance and health benefit programs.
The level of exposure from catastrophic events is limited by the purchase of stop-loss and aggregate liability reinsurance coverage.
Management reviews its assumptions with its independent third-party actuaries to evaluate whether the self-insurance reserves are adequate.
If actual claims or adverse development of loss reserves occur and exceed these estimates, additional reserves may be required.
