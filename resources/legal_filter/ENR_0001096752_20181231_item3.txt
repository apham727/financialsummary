Item 3.
At times, we enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) to reduce these exposures.
For further information on our foreign currency derivative instruments, refer to Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
As of December 31, 2018, there were no open derivative or hedging instruments for future purchases of raw materials or commodities.
Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our variable-rate debt instruments, which currently bear interest based on LIBOR plus margin.
As of December 31, 2018, our outstanding variable-rate debt included $39.0 on our Revolving Facility in the U.S., $185.0 on our Term Loan and $10.1 related to our international, variable-rate note payable.
Assuming a one-percent increase in the applicable interest rates, annual interest expense on these variable-rate debt instruments would increase by approximately $2.3.
