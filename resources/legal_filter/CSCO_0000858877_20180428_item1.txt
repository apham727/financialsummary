1.Basis of Presentation



The fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the “Company” or “Cisco”) is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in July.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Cisco and its subsidiaries.
All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
The Company conducts business globally and is primarily managed on a geographic basis in the following three geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).
The accompanying financial data as of April 28, 2018 and for the three and nine months ended April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017 has been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
However, the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
The Company consolidates its investments in a venture fund managed by SOFTBANK Corp. and its affiliates (“SOFTBANK”) as this is a variable interest entity and the Company is the primary beneficiary.
The noncontrolling interests attributed to SOFTBANK are presented as a separate component from the Company’s equity in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
SOFTBANK’s share of the earnings in the venture fund are not presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented.
Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts in prior periods in order to conform to the current period’s presentation.
The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued.
Cisco adopted this accounting standard update beginning the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on a prospective basis.
This resulted in an overall decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended April 28, 2018 due to recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.
The application of this accounting standard update did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
The guidance is effective January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted.
Cisco early adopted this accounting standard update in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and elected not to reclassify prior periods.
Adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease of $45 million to retained earnings due to the reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings.

(b)Recent Accounting Standards or Updates Not Yet Effective as of Period End



Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition.
The new standard will supersede nearly all U.S. GAAP on revenue recognition and eliminate industry-specific guidance.
The underlying principle of the new standard is to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services at an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
The standard allows two methods of adoption: i) retrospectively to each prior period presented (“full retrospective method”), or ii) retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized in retained earnings as of the date of adoption ("modified retrospective method").
Cisco will adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective method at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Cisco is on schedule in establishing new accounting policies, implementing systems and processes (including more extensive use of estimates), and internal controls necessary to support the requirements of the new standard.
The new standard will primarily impact Cisco’s revenue recognition for software arrangements and sales to two-tier distributors.
In both areas, the new standard will accelerate the recognition of revenue.
The table below details the timing of when revenue is typically recognized under the current revenue standard compared to the timing of when revenue will typically be recognized under the New Revenue Standard for these major areas:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Cisco expects that the new standard will not have a material impact on total revenue in the year of adoption based on two factors: i) revenue will be accelerated consistent with the changes in timing as indicated in the preceding table, largely offset by ii) the reduction of revenue from software arrangements where revenue was previously deferred in prior periods and recognized ratably over time as required under the current standard.
This preliminary assessment is based on the types and number of revenue arrangements currently in place.
Cisco will be required to record cumulative effect adjustments to retained earnings (net of tax) upon adopting the new standard at the beginning of fiscal 2019.
The most significant of these adjustments will be to reduce product deferred revenue and increase retained earnings at the date of adoption to reflect revenue that would have been already recognized under the new standard related to existing arrangements.
Lastly, an adjustment will be recorded to establish an asset and increase retained earnings related to the requirement to capitalize incremental contract acquisition costs for customer contracts.

Financial Instruments In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that changes the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.
The accounting standard update will be effective for Cisco beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and early adoption is permitted.
The most significant impact of this accounting standard update for Cisco is that it will require the remeasurement of investments that are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value at the end of each reporting period with the changes recorded to the income statement.
While Cisco is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its Consolidated Financial Statements, Cisco expects that this accounting standard update will increase the variability of other income (loss), net.
Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update and subsequent amendments related to leases requiring lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities on the balance sheet, as well as corresponding right-of-use assets.
The new lease standard also makes some changes to lessor accounting and aligns key aspects of the lessor accounting model with the revenue recognition standard.
In addition, disclosures will be required to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
The accounting standard update will be effective for Cisco beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 on a modified retrospective basis, and early adoption is permitted.
Cisco is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
The accounting standard update will be effective for Cisco beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 on a modified retrospective basis, and early adoption in fiscal 2020 is permitted.
Cisco is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Classification of Cash Flow Elements In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows.
The accounting standard update will be effective for Cisco beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a retrospective basis, and early adoption is permitted.
Cisco is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The accounting standard update will be effective for Cisco beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a modified retrospective basis, and early adoption is permitted.
Cisco currently estimates a net increase of approximately $1.3 billion to net deferred tax assets and retained earnings upon adoption of the standard related to the unrecognized income tax effects of asset transfers that occurred prior to the adoption date.
Restricted Cash in Statement of Cash Flow In November 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that provides guidance on the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows.
The accounting standard update will be effective for Cisco beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using a retrospective transition method to each period presented, and early adoption is permitted.
Cisco does not expect that this accounting standard update will have a material impact on its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Definition of a Business In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that clarifies the definition of a business to help companies evaluate whether acquisition or disposal transactions should be accounted for as asset groups or as businesses.
The accounting standard update will be effective for Cisco beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a prospective basis.
Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment  In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires the assessment of fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairments.
Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value.
The accounting standard update will be effective for Cisco beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted.
Cisco does not expect that this accounting standard update will impact its Consolidated Financial Statements.

3.Acquisitions and Divestitures 



The Company completed seven acquisitions during the nine months ended April 28, 2018.
A summary of the allocation of the total purchase consideration is presented as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



On July 31, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of privately held Viptela Inc. ("Viptela"), a provider of software-defined wide area networking products.
Revenue from the Viptela acquisition has been included in the Company's Infrastructure Platforms product category.
On September 22, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of privately held Springpath, Inc. ("Springpath"), a hyperconvergence software company.
Revenue from the Springpath acquisition has been included in the Company's Infrastructure Platforms product category.
On February 1, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of publicly held BroadSoft, Inc. ("BroadSoft"), a cloud calling and contact center solutions company.
Revenue from the BroadSoft acquisition has been included in the Company's Applications product category.
The total purchase consideration related to acquisitions completed during the nine months ended April 28, 2018 consisted of cash consideration and vested share-based awards assumed.
The total cash and cash equivalents acquired from these acquisitions was approximately $174 million.
Total transaction costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities were $25 million and $7 million for the nine months ended April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017, respectively.
For the nine months ended April 28, 2018, the Company recognized a gain of $46 million in connection with a step acquisition.
This gain was recognized in other income (loss), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The purchase price allocation for acquisitions completed during recent periods is preliminary and subject to revision as additional information about fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available.
Additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at that time was unknown to the Company may become known to the Company during the remainder of the measurement period, a period not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date.
Adjustments in the purchase price allocation may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the period in which the acquisition occurred.
The goodwill generated from acquisitions completed during the nine months ended April 28, 2018 is primarily related to expected synergies.
The Company completed two divestitures during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
The financial statement impact of these divestitures was not material for the nine months ended April 28, 2018.
Pending Divestiture On May 1, 2018, the Company announced a definitive agreement to sell its Service Provider Video Software Solutions ("SPVSS") business.
As of April 28, 2018, this business had tangible assets of approximately $200 million (primarily comprised of accounts receivables, inventories and various other current and long-term assets) and net intangible assets and goodwill (based on relative fair value) of $300 million.
In addition, the business had total liabilities of approximately $370 million (primarily comprised of deferred revenue and various other current and long-term liabilities).
The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

Impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets for the three and nine months ended April 28, 2018 were $1 million.
Impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets for the three and nine months ended April 29, 2017 were zero and $42 million, respectively.
Of these impairment charges, $38 million was recorded to restructuring and other charges in connection with the Company's decision to exit certain product lines, and the corresponding elimination of future associated cash flows.
Impairment charges were primarily as a result of declines in estimated fair values of certain purchased intangible assets resulting from the reduction or elimination of expected future cash flows associated with certain of the Company’s technology and IPR&D intangible assets.
The following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets, including impairment charges (in millions):

(1) Includes investments that were pending settlement as of the respective fiscal years.
The net unsettled investment purchases (sales) were $(7) million and $(30) million as of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017, respectively.
Non-U.S. government and agency securities include agency and corporate debt securities that are guaranteed by non-U.S. governments.
For the three and nine months ended April 29, 2017, the net realized losses related to the Company's available-for-sale investments included impairment charges of $73 million.
These impairment charges related primarily to publicly traded equity securities and were due to a decline in the fair value of those securities below their cost basis that were determined to be other than temporary.
In addition, as of April 28, 2018, the Company anticipates that it will recover the entire amortized cost basis of such fixed income securities and has determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the nine months ended April 28, 2018.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations.
(d)Securities Lending



The Company periodically engages in securities lending activities with certain of its available for sale investments.
These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis.
The average daily balance of securities lending for the nine months ended April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017 was $0.3 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively.
The Company requires collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets.
The Company engages in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify the Company against collateral losses.
The Company did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented.
As of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017, the Company had no outstanding securities lending transactions.
(e)Investments in Privately Held Companies



The carrying value of the investments in privately held companies was included in other assets.
The Company evaluates on an ongoing basis its investments in these privately held companies and its customer financings, and has determined that as of April 28, 2018, except as disclosed in Note 1, there were no significant variable interest entities required to be consolidated in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
As of April 28, 2018, the carrying value of investments in privately held companies was $969 million, of which $511 million of such investments are considered to be in variable interest entities which are unconsolidated.
In addition, the Company has additional funding commitments of $212 million related to these investments, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand.

Fair Value 



Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)



(Unaudited) 



(a)Fair Value Hierarchy



The accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
The standard establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The fair value hierarchy is as follows:



Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
(b)Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis



Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017 were as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Level 1 publicly traded equity securities are determined by using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
The Company uses such pricing data as the primary input to make its assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of its investment portfolio and has not made, during the periods presented, any material adjustments to such inputs.
The Company’s derivative instruments are primarily classified as Level 2, as they are not actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs.
The Company did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the periods presented.
Level 3 assets include certain derivative instruments, the values of which are determined based on discounted cash flow models using inputs that the Company could not corroborate with market data.
(c)Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis



The following table presents the Company’s assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the indicated periods and the related recognized gains and losses for the periods indicated (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



These assets were measured at fair value due to events or circumstances the Company identified as having significant impact on their fair value during the respective periods.
The fair value measurement of the impaired investments was classified as Level 3 because significant unobservable inputs were used in the valuation due to the absence of quoted market prices and inherent lack of liquidity.
The impairment charges, representing the difference between the net book value and the fair value as a result of the evaluation, were recorded to other income (loss), net.
The remaining carrying value of the investments that were impaired was $56 million and $92 million as of April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017, respectively.
The fair value for purchased intangible assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis was categorized as Level 3 due to the use of significant unobservable inputs in the valuation.
See Note 4.
The remaining carrying value of the specific purchased intangible assets that were impaired was zero and $7 million as of April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017, respectively.
The fair value of property held for sale was measured with the assistance of third-party valuation models, which used discounted cash flow techniques as part of their analysis.
The fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3, as significant unobservable inputs were used in the valuation report.
The remaining carrying value of the property held for sale that was impaired was zero and $11 million as of April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017, respectively.
(d) Other Fair Value Disclosures 



The carrying value of investments in privately held companies that were accounted for under the cost method was $851 million and $859 million as of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017, respectively.

The fair value of short-term loan receivables and financed service contracts approximates their carrying value due to their short duration.
The aggregate carrying value of long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts as of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017 was $3.6 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.
The estimated fair value of long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts approximates their carrying value.
The Company uses significant unobservable inputs in determining discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of its long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts, and therefore they are categorized as Level 3.
As of April 28, 2018, the estimated fair value of the short-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the short maturities.
As of April 28, 2018, the fair value of the Company’s senior notes and other long-term debt was $29.0 billion with a carrying amount of $28.1 billion.
This compares to a fair value of $32.1 billion and a carrying amount of $30.5 billion as of July 29, 2017.
The fair value of the senior notes and other long-term debt was determined based on observable market prices in a less active market and was categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

(c)Credit Facility



On May 15, 2015, the Company entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 15, 2020.
Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent (“Eurocurrency Rate”), for an interest period of one-month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on the Company’s senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than zero.
The Company may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to May 15, 2022.
This credit agreement requires that the Company comply with certain covenants, including that the Company maintains an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.

11.Derivative Instruments 



(a)Summary of Derivative Instruments



The Company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage exposures to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and equity price risks.
The Company’s derivatives expose it to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement.
The Company does, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions.
However, the Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty.
To further limit credit risk, the Company also enters into collateral security arrangements related to certain derivative instruments whereby cash is posted as collateral between the counterparties based on the fair market value of the derivative instrument.
Information related to these offsetting arrangements is summarized as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(c)Foreign Currency Exchange Risk



The Company conducts business globally in numerous currencies.
Therefore, it is exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
To limit the exposure related to foreign currency changes, the Company enters into foreign currency contracts.
The Company does not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.
These currency options and forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, generally have maturities of less than 24 months.
The Company assesses effectiveness based on changes in total fair value of the derivatives.
The effective portion of the derivative instrument’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings.
The ineffective portion, if any, of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately.
During the periods presented, the Company did not discontinue any cash flow hedges for which it was probable that a forecasted transaction would not occur.

The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities such as foreign currency receivables, including long-term customer financings, investments, and payables.
These derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments.
Gains and losses on the contracts are included in other income (loss), net, and substantially offset foreign exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of intercompany balances or other current assets, investments, or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity.
(d)Interest Rate Risk



Interest Rate Derivatives, Investments The Company’s primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk.
To realize these objectives, the Company may utilize interest rate swaps or other derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges.
As of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017, the Company did not have any outstanding interest rate derivatives related to its fixed income securities.
Interest Rate Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges, Long-Term Debt In the nine months ended April 28, 2018, the Company did not enter into any interest rate swaps.
In prior fiscal years, the Company entered into interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges related to fixed-rate senior notes that are due in fiscal 2019 through 2025.
Under these interest rate swaps, the Company receives fixed-rate interest payments and makes interest payments based on LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points.
The effect of such swaps is to convert the fixed interest rates of the senior fixed-rate notes to floating interest rates based on LIBOR.
To manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities, the Company has periodically entered into equity derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges.
In addition, the Company periodically enters into equity derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges.
The Company is also exposed to variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations to employees.
Although not designated as accounting hedges, the Company utilizes derivatives such as total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure.
(f)Hedge Effectiveness 



For the periods presented, amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness were not material for fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedges.
In addition, hedge ineffectiveness for fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedges was not material for any of the periods presented.

(b)Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers 



The Company purchases components from a variety of suppliers and uses several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for its products.
During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, the Company enters into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company or establish the parameters defining the Company’s requirements.
In certain instances, these agreements allow the Company the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed.
The following table summarizes the Company's purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers as of the respective period ends (in millions):

The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.0 billion as of each of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017.
End-User Financing Guarantees The Company also provides financing guarantees for third-party financing arrangements extended to end-user customers related to leases and loans, which typically have terms of up to three years.
The volume of financing provided by third parties for leases and loans as to which the Company had provided guarantees was $3 million and $10 million for the three months ended April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017, respectively, and was $29 million and $47 million for the nine months ended April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017, respectively.
(f)Supplier Component Remediation Liabilities



In fiscal 2014, the Company recorded a charge to product cost of sales of $655 million resulting from failures related to products containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010.
The Company performs regular assessments of the sufficiency of this liability and reduced the amount by $74 million and $164 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively based on updated analyses.
The liabilities related to the supplier component remediation matters as of April 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017 were $98 million and $174 million, respectively.
(g)Indemnifications



In the normal course of business, the Company indemnifies other parties, including customers, lessors, and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters.
These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.
Sprint alleges that the service provider customers infringed Sprint’s patents by offering VoIP telephone services utilizing products provided by the Company generally in combination with those of other manufacturers.
Sprint seeks monetary damages.
Following a trial on March 3, 2017 against Time Warner Inc., a jury in Kansas found that Time Warner Cable willfully infringed five Sprint patents and awarded Sprint $139.8 million in damages.
On March 14, 2017, the Kansas court declined Sprint's request for enhanced damages and entered judgment in favor of Sprint for $139.8 million plus 1.06% in post-judgment interest.
On May 30, 2017, the Court awarded Sprint $20.3 million in pre-judgment interest and denied Time Warner Cable's post-trial motions.
Time Warner Cable has appealed.
On October 16, 2017, Sprint and Comcast Cable Communications, LLC reached resolution of the claims in Sprint's lawsuit against Comcast and, on October 19, 2017, the Kansas court dismissed Sprint's lawsuit.
On December 6, 2017, Sprint and Cox Communications, Inc. reached resolution of the claims in Sprint's lawsuit against Cox, and the Delaware court dismissed Sprint's lawsuit against Cox on December 7, 2017.

The Company believes that Time Warner Cable continues to have strong non-infringement and invalidity defenses and arguments and/or that Sprint’s damages claims are inconsistent with prevailing law at trial and/or on appeal.
Due to the uncertainty surrounding the litigation process, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of the Time Warner Cable litigation at this time.
Should Sprint prevail in litigation, mediation, or settlement, the Company, in accordance with its agreements, may have an obligation to indemnify Time Warner Cable for damages, mediation awards, or settlement amounts arising from its use of Cisco products.
On January 15, 2016, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. (“Huawei”) filed four patent infringement actions against T-Mobile US, Inc. and T-Mobile USA, Inc. (collectively, “T-Mobile”) in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas.
Huawei alleged that T-Mobile’s use of 3GPP standards to implement its 3G and 4G cellular networks infringed 12 patents.
T-Mobile requested indemnity by the Company with respect to portions of the network that use the Company's equipment.
On December 22, 2017, the Eastern District of Texas court dismissed Huawei's four lawsuits after the parties reached settlement, and T-Mobile's indemnity request was subsequently resolved.
For the nine months ended April 28, 2018, the Company recorded legal and indemnification settlement charges of $127 million to product cost of sales in relation to these matters.
At this time, the Company does not anticipate that its obligations regarding the final outcome of the above matters would be material.
In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors, and the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to the Company’s agents.
It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the Company’s limited history with prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.

14.Employee Benefit Plans 



(a)Employee Stock Incentive Plans



Stock Incentive Plan Program Description As of April 28, 2018, the Company had one stock incentive plan: the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”).
In addition, the Company has, in connection with the acquisitions of various companies, assumed the share-based awards granted under stock incentive plans of the acquired companies or issued share-based awards in replacement thereof.
Share-based awards are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions to the Company and provide incentives for them to remain with the Company.
The number and frequency of share-based awards are based on competitive practices, operating results of the Company, government regulations, and other factors.
If any awards granted under the 2005 Plan are forfeited or are terminated for any other reason before being exercised or settled, the unexercised or unsettled shares underlying the awards will again be available under the 2005 Plan.
In addition, starting November 19, 2013, shares withheld by the Company from an award other than a stock option or stock appreciation right to satisfy withholding tax liabilities resulting from such award will again be available for issuance, based on the fungible share ratio in effect on the date of grant.
Pursuant to an amendment approved by the Company's shareholders on November 12, 2009, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan is reduced by 1.5 shares for each share awarded as a stock grant or a stock unit, and any shares underlying awards outstanding from certain previous plans that expire unexercised at the end of their maximum terms become available for reissuance under the 2005 Plan.
The 2005 Plan permits the granting of stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units ("RSUs"), the vesting of which may be performance-based or market-based along with the requisite service requirement, and stock appreciation rights to employees (including employee directors and officers), consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and non-employee directors of the Company.
Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2005 Plan have an exercise price of at least 100% of the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date.
The expiration date for stock options and stock appreciation rights shall be no later than 10 years from the grant date.
The stock options will generally become exercisable for 20% or 25% of the option shares one year from the date of grant and then ratably over the following 48 months or 36 months, respectively.
Time-based stock grants and time-based RSUs will generally vest over a four year term.
The majority of the performance-based and market-based RSUs vests at the end of the three-year requisite service period or earlier if the award recipient meets certain retirement eligibility conditions.
Certain performance-based RSUs, that are based on the achievement of financial and/or non-financial operating goals, typically vest upon the achievement of milestones (and may require subsequent service periods), with overall vesting of the shares underlying the award ranging from six months to three years.
The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors has the discretion to use different vesting schedules.
Stock appreciation rights may be awarded in combination with stock options or stock grants, and such awards shall provide that the stock appreciation rights will not be exercisable unless the related stock options or stock grants are forfeited.
Stock grants may be awarded in combination with non-statutory stock options, and such awards may provide that the stock grants will be forfeited in the event that the related non-statutory stock options are exercised.
(b)Employee Stock Purchase Plan



The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which includes its subplan named the International Employee Stock Purchase Plan (together, the “Purchase Plan”), under which 621 million shares of the Company’s common stock have been reserved for issuance as of April 28, 2018.
Eligible employees are offered shares through a 24-month offering period, which consists of four consecutive 6-month purchase periods.
The Purchase Plan is scheduled to terminate on January 3, 2020.
The Company issued 12 million shares under the Purchase Plan during each of the nine months ended April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017.
As of April 28, 2018, 88 million shares were available for issuance under the Purchase Plan.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of April 28, 2018, the total compensation cost related to unvested share-based awards not yet recognized was $3.0 billion which is expected to be recognized over approximately 2.5 years on a weighted-average basis.
(d)Share-Based Awards Available for Grant



A summary of share-based awards available for grant is as follows (in millions):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As reflected in the preceding table, for each share awarded as restricted stock or subject to a restricted stock unit award under the 2005 Plan, an equivalent of 1.5 shares was deducted from the available share-based award balance.
For restricted stock units that were awarded with vesting contingent upon the achievement of future financial performance or market-based metrics, the maximum awards that can be achieved upon full vesting of such awards were reflected in the preceding table.
The total number of in-the-money stock options exercisable as of April 28, 2018 was 5 million.
As of July 29, 2017, 6 million outstanding stock options were exercisable and the weighted-average exercise price was $5.61.
On the date of grant, the Company estimated the fair value of the total shareholder return ("TSR") component of the PRSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
For the awards based on financial performance metrics or comparative market-based returns, generally 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on the average of annual operating cash flow and earnings per share goals established at the beginning of each fiscal year over a three-year performance period.
Generally, the remaining 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on the Company’s TSR measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer group over the same period.
Each PRSU recipient could vest in 0% to 150% of the target shares granted contingent on the achievement of the Company's financial performance metrics or its comparative market-based returns and 0% to 100% of the target shares granted contingent on the achievement of non-financial operating goals.
The 21% federal tax rate will apply to the Company’s fiscal year ending July 27, 2019 and each year thereafter.
The $1.2 billion foreign withholding tax was paid in February 2018.
In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
The measurement period ends when a company has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year.
As of April 28, 2018, the Company had $2.0 billion of unrecognized tax benefit, of which $1.7 billion, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate.
The Company estimates that the unrecognized tax benefits at April 28, 2018 could be reduced by approximately $250 million in the next 12 months.
