Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 



Except for the change in certain policies upon adoption of the accounting standards described below, there have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies, compared to the accounting policies described in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of the Form 10-K.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards



Cloud Computing Arrangement: On January 1, 2019, the Company early adopted FASB ASU No.
2018-15 (Subtopic 350-40) Intangibles — Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software: Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract, which provides guidance on a customer's accounting for implementation, set-up, and other upfront costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is hosted by a service contract.
The Company has adopted the standard prospectively, and the adoption did not have a material impact on all applicable implementation costs incurred after the adoption date.
Derivatives and Hedging: On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No.
The Company adopted the standard under the modified retrospective approach, and its amendment and presentation and disclosure requirements on a prospective basis.
The adoption did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
See Note 6, Derivative Instruments for additional disclosures required upon adopting the standard.
Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities: On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No.
2017-08 Receivables—Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which shortens the amortization period for the premium on certain purchased callable debt securities to the earliest call date.
The Company adopted the standard under the modified retrospective approach.
The adoption did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Leases: On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and the related subsequent amendments ("ASC 842"), which require recognition by the lessees of right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease liabilities for most leases on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company adopted the new standard under the modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of the effective date.
Under the modified retrospective method, financial results reported in periods prior to 2019 are unchanged.
The Company elected the package of practical expedients, which did not require the reassessment of existing leases under the new guidance.
The Company also elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components and to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases.
See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional disclosures required upon adopting the standard.
Leases



The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception.
The Company evaluates classification of leases at commencement and, as necessary, at modification.
As of September 30, 2019, the Company did not have any finance leases.
Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other accrued liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to lease commencement and excludes lease incentives.
Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or a rate, are expensed as incurred and are not included within the ROU asset and lease liability calculation.
Variable lease payments primarily include reimbursements of costs incurred by lessors for common area maintenance and utilities.
The Company's lease terms are the noncancelable period, including any rent-free periods provided by the lessor, and include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option.
At lease inception, and in subsequent periods as necessary, the Company estimates the lease term based on its assessment of extension and termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised.
Lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company does not separate non-lease components from lease components for all underlying classes of assets.
Lease cost for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Note 5.
The Company's derivative instruments are classified as Level 2, as they are not actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs.
The Company's policy is to recognize asset or liability transfers among Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 at the beginning of the quarter in which a change in circumstances resulted in a transfer.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company had no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy of its assets or liabilities measured at fair value.
The Company's privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock securities are classified as Level 3 assets due to the lack of observable inputs to determine fair value.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, there were no significant activities related to privately-held debt and redeemable preferred stock securities.
There were no impairment charges recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at fair value, when they are deemed to be impaired or when there is an adjustment from observable price changes.
As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had no liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of the Company's total outstanding debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was $1,807.3 million and $2,158.7 million, respectively, based on observable market inputs (Level 2).
The carrying value of the promissory note issued to the Company in connection with the previously completed sale of Junos Pulse, along with the accumulated interest paid in kind, of $73.7 million and $69.0 million approximates its fair value as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.
Notes receivable are generally classified as Level 3 asset due to the lack of observable inputs to determine fair value.
The carrying value of a contract manufacturer deposit of $36.9 million, reported within other long-term assets, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets approximates its fair value as of September 30, 2019.
See Note 7, Other Financial Information, for further information on the contract manufacturer deposit.

We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The notional amount of the Company's derivatives is summarized as follows (in millions): 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Designated Derivatives 



The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the Company's planned cost of revenues and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies.
These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.
Execution of cash flow hedge derivatives typically occurs every month with maturities of eighteen months or less.
The Company recognized an unrealized loss of $12.4 million and $11.1 million in accumulated other comprehensive income for the effective portion of its derivative instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively; and an unrealized loss of $6.1 million and $8.6 million for the comparable periods in fiscal 2018, respectively.
The Company reclassified a loss of $0.8 million and $1.5 million out of accumulated other comprehensive income to cost of revenues and operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, and a loss of $3.1 million and a gain of $5.8 million for the comparable periods in fiscal 2018, respectively.
In September 2019, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300.0 million designated as fair value hedges of our fixed-rate 2041 Notes.
These swaps convert the fixed interest rates of the notes to floating interest rates based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
Most of the interest rate swaps will expire within ten years or less.
The Company recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Other expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of change.
These derivatives are classified in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same section as the underlying item.
See Note 5, Fair Value Measurements, for the fair values of the Company's derivative instruments in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Non-Designated Derivatives 



The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate variability in gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
These foreign exchange forward contracts typically have maturities of approximately one to four months.
The outstanding non-designated derivative instruments are carried at fair value.
