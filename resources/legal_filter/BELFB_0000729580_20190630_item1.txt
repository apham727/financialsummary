BEL FUSE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 



NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 



1.
These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Bel Fuse Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted from the following condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations, including the interim reporting requirements, of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
The Company’s significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2019, except as discussed in “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards” below.
All amounts included in the tables to these notes to condensed consolidated financial statements, except per share amounts, are in thousands.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), to provide a new comprehensive model for lease accounting.
Under this guidance, lessees and lessors should apply a “right-of-use” model in accounting for all leases (including subleases) and eliminate the concept of operating leases and off-balance sheet leases.
Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease.
Similar modifications have been made to lessor accounting in-line with revenue recognition guidance.
This guidance was effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
The amendments also require certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 as amended effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach.
In connection with the adoption, we elected to utilize the Comparatives Under 840 Option whereby the Company will continue to present prior period financial statements and disclosures under ASC 840.
In addition, we elected the transition package of three practical expedients permitted within the standard, which eliminates the requirements to reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.
Further, we elected a short-term lease exception policy, permitting us to not apply the recognition requirements of this standard to short-term leases (i.e.
leases with terms of 12 months or less) and an accounting policy to account for lease and non-lease components as a single component for certain classes of assets.
Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of right-of-use assets in the amount of $20.7 million and lease liabilities related to our operating leases in the amount of $21.0 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019.
The standard did not materially affect the Company’s consolidated net earnings or have any impact on cash flows.
See Note 12, Leases, for Topic 842 disclosures in connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-02.
This guidance was adopted by the Company effective January 1, 2019.
In accordance with this guidance, the Company reclassified $0.5 million of stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings within the equity section of the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019.

In May 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies the accounting for share-based payments granted to nonemployees for goods and services.
This guidance will better align the treatment of share-based payments to nonemployees with the requirements for such share-based payments granted to employees.
This guidance is effective for all public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that year.
This guidance was adopted by the Company effective January 1, 2019 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted 



In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”).
The amendment is currently effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU 2017-04”).
ASU 2017-04 simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
Early adoption is permitted for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
The Company is required to adopt ASU 2017-04 for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and the guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.
The updated guidance improves the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements.
The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.
Early adoption is permitted for any removed or modified disclosures.
The Company is currently assessing the timing and impact of adopting the updated provisions.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans (“ASU 2018-14”).
This guidance removes certain disclosures that are not considered cost beneficial, clarifies certain required disclosures and added additional disclosures.
The standard is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020.
The amendments in ASU 2018-14 would need to be applied on a retrospective basis.
The Company is currently assessing the impact the new guidance will have on its disclosures.
This guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.
This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impacts that adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 



Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based upon the best use of the asset or liability at the measurement date.
Entities are required to use a fair value hierarchy which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our available-for-sale securities primarily consisted of investments held in a rabbi trust which are intended to fund the Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) obligations.
These securities are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) inputs and amounted to $1.3 million at June 30, 2019 and $1.4 million at December 31, 2018.
The Company does not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the six months ended June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2018.
There were no financial assets accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018.

The Company has other financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, which are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature.
The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow method based on interest rates that are currently available for debt issuances with similar terms and maturities.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of total debt was $118.5 million and $117.9 million, respectively, compared to a carrying amount of $113.0 million and $114.2 million, respectively.
The Company did not have any other financial liabilities within the scope of the fair value disclosure requirements as of June 30, 2019.
Nonfinancial assets and liabilities, such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, are accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
These items are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event or in the case of goodwill, on at least an annual basis.
There were no triggering events that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2019 that would warrant interim impairment testing.
