Item 3.
Interest Rate Exposure



Our term loans bear variable interest rates which subject us to interest rate risk.
Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in the short-term LIBOR rate, the federal funds effective rate and the prime rate.
As of June 30, 2019, the weighted average stated interest rate on the term loans was 5.4%.
At June 30, 2019, the outstanding term loans principal balance was $541.1 million, net of unamortized deferred financing costs of $5.8 million.
During the nine months ended June 30, 2019, we incurred cash interest expense of $20.0 million on the term loans.
A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a $3.8 million change in interest expense incurred during the nine months ended June 30, 2019.
Our cash and cash equivalents consist principally of money market securities that are short-term in nature.
At June 30, 2019, our total short-term and long-term investments were $2.9 million, consisting mostly of highly rated corporate debt securities and other debt securities.
At June 30, 2019, we had no securities in an unrealized loss position.
A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in insignificant increase in interest income earned during the nine months ended June 30, 2019.
Currency Rate Exposure



We have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in Euros, British Pounds and a variety of Asian currencies.
Such balances were approximately $123.4 million and $84.7 million, respectively, at June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, and related to the Euro, British Pound and a variety of Asian currencies.
We also utilize forward contracts to mitigate our exposures to currency movement.
We incurred foreign currency losses of $1.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, which related to the currency fluctuation on these balances between the time the transaction occurred and the ultimate settlement of the transaction.
