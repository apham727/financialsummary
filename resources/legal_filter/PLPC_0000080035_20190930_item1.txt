The Company’s measurement date for its annual impairment test for goodwill is October 1st of each year.
The Company performs its annual impairment test for goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology, market comparables, and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit.
The Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value to assess if goodwill has been impaired.
However, the Company believes that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units.
The Company’s valuation method uses Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy.
The Company’s only intangible asset with an indefinite life is goodwill.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, by segment, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 are as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



There were 750 and -0- stock options exercised under this Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
As all stock options from the 1999 Stock Option Plan had been fully vested and exercised, the Company recorded no compensation expense related to stock options for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.
Long Term Incentive Plan of 2008 and 2016 Incentive Plan 



The Company maintains an equity award program to give the Company a competitive advantage in attracting, retaining, and motivating officers, employees and directors and to provide an incentive to those individuals to increase shareholder value through long-term incentives directly linked to the Company’s performance.
Under the Preformed Line Products Company Long Term Incentive Plan of 2008 (the “LTIP”), certain employees, officers, and directors were eligible to receive awards of options, restricted shares and restricted share units (RSUs).
The total number of Company common shares reserved for awards under the LTIP was 900,000, of which 800,000 common shares were reserved for RSUs and 100,000 common shares have been reserved for share options.
The LTIP was terminated and replaced with the Preformed Line Products Company 2016 Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”) in May 2016 upon approval by the Company’s Shareholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 10, 2016.
No further awards will be made under the LTIP and previously granted awards remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.
The total number of Company common shares reserved for awards under the Incentive Plan is 1,000,000 of which 900,000 common shares have been reserved for restricted share awards and 100,000 common shares have been reserved for share options.
The Incentive Plan expires on May 10, 2026.
14 



Restricted Share Units 



For the regular annual grants, a portion of the RSUs is subject to time-based cliff vesting and a portion is subject to vesting based upon the Company’s performance over a set period for all participants except the CEO.
All of the CEO’s regular annual RSUs are subject to vesting based upon the Company’s performance over a set-year period.
The RSUs are offered at no cost to the employees.
The fair value of RSUs is based on the market price of a common share on the grant date and the shares underlying the awards are not issued until they vest.
Dividends declared are accrued in cash.
Compensation expense related to the time-based RSUs for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 was $.2 million and $.4 million, respectively.
Compensation expense related to the time-based RSUs for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 was $.1 million and $.3 million, respectively.
As of September 30, 2019, there was $.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to time-based RSUs that is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining period of approximately 1.8 years.
Depending on the extent to which the performance criterions are satisfied under the LTIP and the Incentive Plan, the participants are eligible to earn common shares over the vesting period.
Performance-based compensation expense for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 was $1.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively.
Performance-based compensation expense for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 was $1.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively.
As of September 30, 2019, the remaining compensation expense of $4.8 million for outstanding performance-based RSU’s is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately 1.7 years.
In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the LTIP and the Incentive Plan), vesting of the RSUs will be accelerated and all restrictions will lapse.
Unvested performance-based awards will vest on a target potential payout.
Any additional awards granted will also be issued from the Company’s authorized but unissued shares.
Share Option Awards 



The LTIP permitted and now the Incentive Plan permits the grant of 100,000 options to buy common shares of the Company to certain employees at not less than fair market value of the shares on the date of grant.
Options issued to date under the LTIP and the Incentive Plan vest 50% after one year following the date of the grant, 75% after two years, and 100% after three years, and expire from five to ten years from the date of grant.
Shares issued as a result of stock option exercises will be funded with the issuance of new shares.
The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating fair values of options.
The Company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions.
The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. zero coupon Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant.
15 



There were no options granted for either of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.
Stock option activity under the Company’s LTIP for nine months ended September 30, 2019 was as follows: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For both three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, the Company recorded compensation expense related to the stock options currently vested of less than $.1 million.
The total compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized at September 30, 2019 is expected to be less than $.1 million over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.9 years.
Deferred Compensation Plan 



The Company maintains a trust, commonly referred to as a rabbi trust, in connection with the Company’s deferred compensation plan.
This plan allows for two deferrals.
First, Directors make elective deferrals of Director fees payable and held in the rabbi trust.
The deferred compensation plan allows the Directors to elect to receive Director fees in common shares of the Company at a later date instead of fees paid each quarter in cash.
Second, this plan allows certain Company employees to defer restricted shares or RSUs for future distribution in the form of common shares.
Assets of the rabbi trust are consolidated, and the value of the Company’s common shares held in the rabbi trust is classified in Shareholders’ equity and generally accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock.
The Company recognizes the original amount of the deferred compensation (fair value of the deferred stock award at the date of grant) as the basis for recognition in common shares issued to the rabbi trust.
Changes in the fair value of amounts owed to certain employees or Directors are not recognized as the Company’s deferred compensation plan does not permit diversification and must be settled by the delivery of a fixed number of the Company’s common shares.
As of September 30, 2019, 267,641 shares have been deferred and are being held in the rabbi trust.
A fair value hierarchy is used for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data, (observable inputs), and the Company’s assumptions (unobservable inputs).
The hierarchy consists of the following three levels: 



Level 1  



Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2  



Inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable, which may include: 



o  



Quoted prices for similar assets in active markets; 



o  



Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; 



o  



Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and  



o  



Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
The liability for this unfunded Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan was $5.3 million at September 30, 2019 and $4.9 million at December 31, 2018.
These amounts are recorded within Other noncurrent liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
During January 2018, the Company amended the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan to allow the participants the ability to hypothetically invest their proportionate award into various investment options, which primarily includes mutual funds.
The Company credits earnings, gains and losses to the participants’ deferred compensation account balances based on the investments selected by the participants.
The Company measures the fair value of the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan liability using the market values of the participants’ underlying investment accounts.
In order to mitigate the risk associated with the Supplemental Profit Sharing Plan, the Company had invested in marketable securities, principally equity-based mutual funds, which were all transferred to the Company’s Corporate Owned Life Insurance Policy (“COLI”) in April 2019.
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the cash surrender value of the COLI was $5.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, and is recorded in Other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
Changes in the fair value of the securities of less than $.1 million and $.1 million were recognized within Other income, net within the consolidated statements of income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
NOTE K – RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 



In August 2018, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No.
33-10532, “Disclosure Update and Simplification,” which makes a number of changes meant to simplify interim disclosures.
The Company adopted the new disclosure requirements for the period ending September 30, 2019.
17 



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” The amendments in this update require the recognition of assets and liabilities arising from lease transactions on the balance sheet and the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements.
Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation for leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance.
Both the asset and liability will initially be measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term.
Initial costs directly attributable to negotiating and arranging the lease will be included in the asset.
For leases with a term of 12 months or less, the lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to not recognize an asset and corresponding liability.
The lessee is also required to provide additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
This ASU was applied using a modified retrospective adoption method with the option of applying the guidance either retrospectively to each prior comparative reporting period presented or retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption, effective January 1, 2019.
The Company applied the transitional package of practical expedients allowed by the standard to not reassess the identification, classification and initial direct costs of leases commencing before this ASU's effective date, however, the Company did not elect the hindsight transitional practical expedient.
The Company also applied the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components to new leases as well as existing leases through transition.
The Company also elected the practical expedient allowed under “Leases (Topic 842)” to exclude leases with a term of twelve months or less form the calculation of the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, “Targeted Improvements to ASC 842,” which includes an option to not restate comparative periods in transition and elect to use the effective date of ASC 842 as the initial application of transition.
The amendments in Topic 842 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
The Company has finalized its policy elections, the discount rate used and data to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard.
The adoption of this ASU resulted in an initial recognition of right-of-use assets and corresponding current and long-term lease obligations, on a discounted basis, of its lease obligations of $10.4 million on the Company’s balance sheet at January 1, 2019.
Refer to Note Q “Leases” for additional details regarding the Company’s leases as of September 30.
2019.
The adoption of ASU 842 did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or debt covenants.
NOTE L – NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED 



The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs.
Recently issued ASUs that are not listed below were assessed and determined to be not applicable in the current reporting period.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement,” which will modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, including the removal of certain disclosure requirements.
The amendments in ASU 2018-13 are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019.
Early adoption is permitted.
An entity is permitted to early adopt any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance of the ASU and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until the effective date.
The Company is currently evaluating what impact its adoption, effective January 1, 2020, will have to the presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”).
This update introduces the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which will require an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables.
Under this update, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity will be required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entity’s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument.
ASU 2016-13 is effective for public companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company is currently evaluating what impact its adoption, effective January 1, 2020, will have to the presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

(“Helix”) and Preformed Line Products (Canada) Limited (“PLPC Canada”), were each named, jointly and severally, with each of SNC-Lavalin ATP, Inc. (“SNC ATP”), HD Supply Canada Inc., by its trade names HD Supply Power Solutions and HD Supply Utilities (“HD Supply”), and Anixter Power Solutions Canada Inc. (the corporate successor to HD Supply), “Anixter” and, together with the Company, PLPC Canada, Helix, SNC ATP and HD Supply, the (“Defendants”) in a complaint filed by Altalink, L.P. (the “Plaintiff”) in the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta in Alberta, Canada in November 2016 (the “Complaint”).
The Complaint states that Plaintiff engaged SNC ATP to design, engineer, procure and construct numerous power distribution and transmission facilities in Alberta (the “Projects”) and that through SNC ATP and HD Supply (now Anixter), spacer dampers manufactured by Helix were procured and installed in the Projects.
The Complaint alleges that the spacer dampers have and may continue to become loose, open and detach from the conductors, resulting in damage and potential injury and a failure to perform the intended function of providing spacing and damping to the Project.
The Plaintiffs were initially seeking an estimated $56.0 million Canadian dollars in damages jointly and severally from the Defendants, representing the costs of monitoring and replacing the spacer dampers and remediating property damage, due to alleged defects in the design and construction of, and supply of materials for, the Projects by SNC ATP and HD Supply/Anixter and in the design of the spacer dampers by Helix.
The Plaintiffs reduced their demand for damages to $29.4 million Canadian dollars on June 1, 2018.
