BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  



Basis of Presentation  



We have prepared the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
However, we believe that the disclosures herein are adequate to ensure the information presented is not misleading.
We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring items, have been included in the accompanying financial statements to present fairly the results of the interim periods.
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation.
Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, operating income or net income (loss).
Impacts of the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  



The comparability of our operating results in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year periods, and of our consolidated balance sheets as of February 28, 2018 relative to May 31, 2017, was impacted by the U.S. 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.
The net expense related to the enactment of the Act has been accounted for during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2018 based on provisional estimates pursuant to the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118.
Subsequent adjustments, if any, will be accounted for in the period such adjustments are identified.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash  



Restricted cash that was included within cash and cash equivalents as presented within our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of February 28, 2018 and May 31, 2017 and our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 was nominal.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Non-Operating Income, net  



Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Japan) and net other income, including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments and net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio that we classify as trading.

Sales of Financing Receivables  



We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware products and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts.
We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution.
We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables.
Financing receivables sold to financial institutions were $360 million and $1.3 billion for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018, respectively, and $296 million and $1.3 billion for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2017, respectively.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements  



Comprehensive Income: In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2018-02, Income StatementReporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2018-02), which allows companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the Act, from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.
The guidance also requires certain new disclosures regardless of the election.
ASU 2018-02 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and earlier adoption is permitted.
Derivatives and Hedging: In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (ASU 2017-12), which amends and simplifies existing guidance in order to allow companies to more accurately present the economic effects of risk management activities in the financial statements.
ASU 2017-12 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and earlier adoption is permitted.
Retirement Benefits: In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, CompensationRetirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (ASU 2017-07), which provides guidance on the capitalization, presentation and disclosure of net benefit costs.
ASU 2017-07 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
ASU 2016-16 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a modified retrospective basis, and earlier adoption is permitted.
Financial Instruments: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13), which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held.
ASU 2016-13 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2021, and earlier adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial InstrumentsOverall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU 2016-01), which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
ASU 2016-01 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2019, and earlier adoption is not permitted except for certain provisions.

Leases: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in September 2017 within ASU 2017-13 (collectively, Topic 842).
Topic 842 requires companies to generally recognize on the balance sheet operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets.
Topic 842 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2020 on a modified retrospective basis, and earlier adoption is permitted.
Revenue Recognition: In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in August 2015, March 2016, April 2016, May 2016, December 2016, May 2017, September 2017 and November 2017 within ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12, ASU 2016-20, ASU 2017-10, ASU 2017-13 and ASU 2017-14, respectively (collectively, Topic 606).
Topic 606 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP.
The core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.
Topic 606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation, among others.
Topic 606 also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts.
Topic 606 is effective for us as of our first quarter of fiscal 2019 using either of two methods: (1) retrospective application of Topic 606 to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within Topic 606 or (2) retrospective application of Topic 606 with the cumulative effect of initially applying Topic 606 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per Topic 606.
The accounting for the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts under Topic 606 is significantly different than our current capitalization policy.
The adoption of Topic 606 will result in additional types of costs that will be capitalized.
Additionally, it is possible that amounts capitalized will be amortized over a period longer than our current policy.
We plan to adopt Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 pursuant to the aforementioned adoption method (1) and we do not believe there will be a material impact to our revenues upon adoption.

ACQUISITIONS  



Fiscal 2018 Proposed Acquisitions  



During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we entered into certain non-material agreements to acquire certain companies and expect these proposed acquisitions to close during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
Fiscal 2017 Acquisition of NetSuite Inc., a Related Party  



On November 7, 2016, we completed our acquisition of NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite), a provider of cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and related applications and a related party to Oracle.
We acquired NetSuite to, among other things, expand our cloud software as a service offerings with a complementary set of cloud ERP and related cloud software applications for customers.
Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracles Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer and Oracles largest stockholder, is an affiliate of NetSuites largest stockholder, NetSuite Restricted Holdings LLC (a single member

(Unaudited)  



 LLC investment entity whose interests are beneficially owned by a trust controlled by Mr. Ellison), which owned approximately 40% of the issued and outstanding NetSuite Shares immediately prior to the conclusion of the merger.
The total purchase price for NetSuite was approximately $9.1 billion, which consisted of approximately $9.0 billion in cash and $78 million for the fair values of restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed.
In allocating the purchase price based on estimated fair values, we recorded approximately $6.7 billion of goodwill, $3.2 billion of identifiable intangible assets and $763 million of net tangible liabilities.
Goodwill generated from our acquisition of NetSuite was primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition.
See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017 for additional information regarding our acquisition of NetSuite.
Other Fiscal 2017 Acquisitions  



During fiscal 2017, we acquired certain companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our cloud-based offerings.
The total of the purchase prices, certain of which were preliminary, for these acquisitions was approximately $3.0 billion, which consisted of approximately $3.0 billion in cash and $13 million for the fair values of restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed.
As of February 28, 2018, we recorded $243 million of net tangible assets and $948 million of identifiable intangible assets, based on their estimated fair values, and $1.8 billion of residual goodwill related to our fiscal 2017 acquisitions.
Certain amounts included in these totals were preliminary and subject to change during the respective measurement periods (up to one year from the respective acquisition dates) as we obtain additional information for the preliminary fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The unaudited pro forma financial information for all periods presented included the business combination accounting effects resulting from these acquisitions, including amortization charges from acquired intangible assets (certain of which are preliminary), stock-based compensation charges for unvested restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed, if any, and the related tax effects as though the aforementioned companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2017.
The unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018 presented the historical results of Oracle for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018 as we did not complete any material acquisitions during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
The unaudited pro forma financial information was as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  



We perform fair value measurements in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurement.
ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
An assets or a liabilitys categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  



       Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  



       Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or  



       Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  



Our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, consisted of the following (Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are defined above):  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Our marketable securities investments consist of Tier 1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities.
As of February 28, 2018 and May 31, 2017, approximately 28% and 32%, respectively, of our marketable securities investments mature within one year and 72% and 68%, respectively, mature within one to six years.
Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our marketable securities that were classified as Level 1 in the table above were derived from quoted market prices and active markets for these instruments that exist.
Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of Level 2 instruments listed in the table above, the counterparties to which have high credit ratings, were derived from the following: non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated by observable market data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, or pricing models, such as discounted cash flow techniques, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data including LIBOR-based yield curves, among others.
Based on the trading prices of the $60.9 billion and $54.0 billion of senior notes and the related fair value hedges that were outstanding as of February 28, 2018 and May 31, 2017, respectively, the estimated fair values of the senior notes and the related fair value hedges using Level 2 inputs at February 28, 2018 and May 31, 2017 were $62.0 billion and $56.5 billion, respectively.

NOTES PAYABLE AND OTHER BORROWINGS  



Senior Notes  



In November 2017, we issued $10.0 billion, par value, of fixed-rate senior notes comprised of the following as of February 28, 2018:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



We issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment of indebtedness and future acquisitions.
The interest is payable semi-annually.
We may redeem some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances.
The senior notes rank pari passu with any other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Oracle Corporation.
All existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of the subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation are or will be effectively senior to the senior notes.
We were in compliance with all debt-related covenants at February 28, 2018.
7.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, our management supplemented the 2017 Restructuring Plan to reflect additional actions that we expect to take.
We recorded $516 million of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2017 Restructuring Plan in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and we expect to incur the majority of the estimated remaining $112 million through the end of fiscal 2018.

DEFERRED REVENUES  



Deferred revenues consisted of the following:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Deferred software license updates and product support revenues and deferred hardware revenues substantially represent customer payments made in advance for support contracts that are typically billed on a per annum basis in advance with corresponding revenues being recognized ratably over the support periods.
Deferred cloud software as a service (SaaS) and deferred cloud platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) revenues generally resulted from customer payments made in advance for our cloud-based offerings that are recognized over the corresponding contractual term.
Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed.
16  



Table of Contents 



ORACLE CORPORATION  



NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  



February 28, 2018  



(Unaudited)  



 Deferred new software licenses revenues typically resulted from customer payments that relate to undelivered products or specified enhancements, customer specific acceptance provisions, time-based license arrangements and software license transactions that cannot be separated from undelivered consulting or other services.
In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS, cloud PaaS and IaaS and software license updates and product support obligations, among others, assumed from our acquired companies.
We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumed using a cost build-up approach.
The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin.
The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations.
9.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  



We held certain derivative and non-derivative instruments that were accounted for pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815) and that were utilized in a consistent manner as of February 28, 2018 and May 31, 2017 and during the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017.
These instruments include:  



       interest rate swap agreements, which are used to protect us against changes in the fair values of certain of our fixed-rate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate movements and are accounted for as fair value hedges;  



       cross-currency swap agreements, which are used to manage foreign currency exchange risk by converting certain of our fixed-rate Euro-denominated borrowings to fixed-rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and are accounted for as cash flow hedges; and  



       foreign currency borrowings, which are used to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the U.S. Dollar and are accounted for as net investment hedges.
We also held certain foreign currency contracts that were not designated as hedges pursuant to ASC 815.
As of February 28, 2018 and May 31, 2017, the notional amounts of such forward contracts we held to purchase U.S.
Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $4.5 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, and the notional amount of forward contracts we held to sell U.S.
Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.
The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal as of February 28, 2018 and May 31, 2017.
The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activities.
Net gains or losses related to these forward contracts are included in non-operating income, net.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY  



Common Stock Repurchases  



Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $24.0 billion.
As of February 28, 2018, approximately $22.8 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
We repurchased 131.6 million shares for $6.5 billion during the nine months ended February 28, 2018 (including 2.1 million shares for $105 million that were repurchased but not settled) and 74.6 million shares for $3.0 billion during the nine months ended February 28, 2017 under the stock repurchase program.
The dividend is payable on May 1, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 17, 2018.
Fiscal 2018 Stock-Based Awards Activity, Valuation and Compensation Expense  



During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we issued 41 million restricted stock-based awards and 77 million stock options (consisting of 8 million service-based stock options (SOs) and 69 million performance-based and market-based stock options (PSOs)).
Substantially all of the awards were issued as a part of our annual stock-based award process and are subject to service-based vesting restrictions, with the PSOs primarily having performance-based and market-based vesting restrictions.
Our fiscal 2018 stock-based awards issuances were partially offset by forfeitures and cancellations of 16 million shares during the first nine months of fiscal 2018.
The RSUs and SOs that were granted during the nine months ended February 28, 2018 have vesting restrictions, valuations and contractual lives of a similar nature to those described in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017.
The fiscal 2018 PSOs granted consist of seven numerically equivalent vesting tranches that potentially may vest.
Each of six of the individual vesting tranches are governed by an all or nothing vesting schedule requiring the attainment of both a performance metric and a market capitalization metric, which may be achieved at any time, in order for each individual tranche to fully vest during a five year performance period, assuming continued employment and service through the date the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors certifies that the last of the two metrics for a particular tranche is attained.
The seventh vesting tranche requires attainment of a market-based metric to be achieved at any time during a five year performance period and continued employment and service through the vesting date.
The PSOs have contractual lives of eight years in comparison to the ten year contractual lives for the fiscal 2018 SOs issued.
We estimated the fair values of the PSOs using a Monte Carlo simulation approach with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 2.14%, expected term of 7 years, expected volatility of 22.44% and dividend yield of 1.49%.
Stock-based compensation expense is to be recognized for each of the six performance-based and market-based tranches once each vesting tranche becomes probable of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service period for performance-metric achievement or derived service period for market-based metric achievement.
We have preliminarily estimated service periods for those tranches that have been deemed probable of achievement to be approximately three to five years.
Stock-based compensation for the market-based tranche will be recognized using the derived service period for the market-based metric achievement, which we have initially estimated to be approximately three years.

On July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.
A final decision has yet to be issued by the Tax Court due to other outstanding issues related to the case.
At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations.
We have reviewed this case and its impact on Oracle and concluded that no adjustment to the consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time.
If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.

SEGMENT INFORMATION  



ASC 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments.
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
Our chief operating decision makers (CODMs) are our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer.
We are organized by line of business and geographically.
While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed.
In recent periods, customer demand has increased at a greater rate for cloud-based IT deployment models relative to on-premise IT deployment models.
As a result, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we updated our operating segments.
We have three businessescloud and on-premise software, hardware and serviceseach of which is comprised of a single operating segment.
Our cloud and on-premise software line of business markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications, platform and infrastructure technologies through our cloud offerings and software offerings.
Our Oracle Cloud SaaS and Cloud PaaS and IaaS offerings deliver certain of our applications, platform and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we host, manage and support.
Our IaaS offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services, which are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management, maintenance and security services for on-premise, cloud-based or hybrid IT infrastructures.
Our cloud and on-premise software business also licenses our software products, generally on a perpetual basis, including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java, among

 others, for cloud and other IT environments.
Customers that license our software have the option to purchase software license updates and product support contracts, which provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases, patch releases, internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel during the support period.
Our hardware business provides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, virtualization software, operating systems including the Oracle Solaris operating system and management software to support diverse IT environments.
Our hardware business also includes hardware support, which provides customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software, and can include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.
Our services business provides services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications, platform and infrastructure technologies.
Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment.

EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE  



Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock-based awards, stock options, and shares issuable under the employee stock purchase plan as applicable pursuant to the treasury stock method.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share:

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  



Hewlett-Packard Company Litigation  



On June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company, now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HP), filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action including breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, defamation, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act.
The complaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HPs Itanium-based servers, it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20, 2010 between HP and Mark Hurd (the Hurd Settlement Agreement), who is our Chief Executive Officer and was both HPs former chief executive officer and chairman of HPs board of directors.
HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties rights and obligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief.
Oracle answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint, which was amended on December 2, 2011.
Oracle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor, and had misrepresented to customers that the Itanium microprocessor had a long roadmap, among other claims.
Oracle sought equitable rescission of the Hurd Settlement Agreement, and other equitable and monetary relief.
The court bifurcated the trial and tried HPs causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012.
The court issued a final statement of decision on August 28, 2012, finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HPs Itanium-based servers and to port such products at no cost to HP for as long as HP sells those servers (the Phase One Ruling).
A jury trial began on May 23, 2016.
On June 30, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and against Oracle on its claim for violation of the Lanham Act (the Phase Two Jury Verdict).
The jury awarded HP damages in the amount of $3.0 billion, and HP is entitled to post-judgment interest on this award.
On August 30, 2016, the court denied HPs motion for pre-judgment interest.
Judgment was entered on October 20, 2016.
Oracle posted certain court-mandated surety bonds with the court in order to proceed with its motion for a new trial and entered into related indemnification agreements with each of the surety bond issuing companies.
Oracle filed a motion for a new trial on November 14, 2016, which was denied.
Oracle filed its notice of appeal on January 17, 2017, specifying that it was appealing the trial courts Phase One Ruling and Phase Two Jury Verdict.
On February 2, 2017, HP filed a notice of appeal of the trial courts denial of pre-judgment interest.
No amounts have been paid or recorded to our results of operations either prior to or subsequent to the Phase One Ruling or Phase Two Jury Verdict.
We continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses against HPs claims, and we intend to present these defenses to the appellate court.
Among the arguments we expect to make on appeal are the following: the trial court misapplied fundamental principles of contract law and misinterpreted the Hurd Settlement Agreement, including by disregarding the context of the Hurd Settlement Agreement and the evidence of the parties mutual intentions; that HPs breach of contract claim should fail as a matter of law because HP does not claim and did not prove that Oracle failed to deliver any software under the trial courts interpretation of the contract; that awarding HP both damages for breach of the Hurd Settlement Agreement and specific performance of that agreement constitutes an improper double recovery; and that the damages award is excessive, unsupported by the evidence, and contrary to law.
Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of the appeal process related to this action is uncertain.

Derivative Litigation  



On May 3, 2017, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware.
The derivative suit is brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracles behalf, against Oracle, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Technology Officer in his capacities as a director, officer and an alleged controlling stockholder, one of our Chief Executive Officers (who is also a director), three other directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant.
Plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) at an excessive price.
Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, an order rescinding or reforming the NetSuite transaction, unspecified monetary damages (including interest), attorneys fees and costs, and disgorgement of various unspecified profits, fees, compensation, and benefits.
On July 19, 2017, defendants moved to dismiss this complaint.
On July 18, 2017, a second stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, brought by another alleged stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracles behalf.
The suit is brought against all current members and one former member of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant.
Plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite at an excessive price.
Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, unspecified monetary damages (including interest), and attorneys fees and costs.
On August 9, 2017, the court consolidated the two derivative cases, and vacated the scheduling order relating to defendants motion to dismiss the first case.
In a September 7, 2017 order, the court appointed plaintiffs counsel in the second case as lead plaintiffs counsel and designated the July 18, 2017 complaint as the operative complaint.
The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on October 27, 2017, and the plaintiffs filed an opposition on December 15, 2017.
The defendants filed their reply on January 9, 2018, and the court heard oral argument on January 25, 2018.
On March 19, 2018, the court denied this motion.
The court ordered supplemental briefing on the issue whether all of the defendants, except for our Chief Technology Officer and one of our Chief Executive Officers, should be dismissed from this case.
