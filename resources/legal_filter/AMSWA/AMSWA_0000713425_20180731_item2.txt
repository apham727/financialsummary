In July 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided an update to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) for the 2018 and 2019 world economic growth forecast. The update noted that, Global growth is projected to reach 3.9 percent in 2018 and 2019, in line with the forecast of the April 2018 World Economic Outlook (WEO), but the expansion is becoming less even, and risks to the outlook are mounting. The rate of expansion appears to have peaked in some major economies and growth has become less synchronized. In the United States, near-term momentum is strengthening in line with the April WEO forecast, and the US dollar has appreciated by around 5 percent in recent weeks. Growth projections have been revised down for the euro area, Japan, and the United Kingdom, reflecting negative surprises to activity in early 2018. Among emerging market and developing economies, growth prospects are also becoming more uneven, amid rising oil prices, higher yields in the United States, escalating trade tensions, and market pressures on the currencies of some economies with weaker fundamentals. Growth projections have been revised down for Argentina, Brazil, and India, while the outlook for some oil exporters has strengthened.

We believe improved economic conditions may be driving some businesses to focus on achieving more process and efficiency enhancements in their operations and to invest in solutions that improve operating margins, rather than make large infrastructure-type technology purchases. If this trend continues, we believe it may tend to favor solutions such as our supply chain solutions, which are designed to provide a more rapid return on investment and are targeted at some of the largest profit drivers in a customers business.  
The SCM segment consists of Logility, which is a leading provider of collaborative supply chain optimization and advanced retail planning solutions that help medium, large and Fortune 500 companies transform their supply chain operations to gain a competitive advantage. Recognized for its high-touch approach to customer service, rapid implementations and industry-leading return on investment (ROI), as well as (i) DMI, which delivers affordable, easy-to-use Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) supply chain planning solutions designed to increase forecast accuracy, improve customer service and reduce inventory to maximize profits and lower costs, (ii) NGC, which is a leading provider of cloud-based supply chain and product lifecycle management solutions for brands, retailers and consumer products companies, and (iii) Halo, which is an advanced analytics software provider leveraging an innovative blend of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to drive greater supply chain performance. The Other segment consists of (i) American Software ERP, which provides purchasing and materials management, customer order processing, financial, e-commerce and traditional manufacturing solutions, and (ii) corporate overhead and other common expenses.  
Our cost of revenue for licenses includes amortization of capitalized computer software development costs, amortization of acquired developed technology, royalties paid to third-party software vendors, and agent commission expenses related to license revenues generated by the indirect channel, primarily from DMI. Costs for maintenance and services include the cost of personnel to conduct implementations and customer support, consulting, other personnel-related expenses, and agent commission expenses related to maintenance revenues generated by the indirect channel, primarily from DMI. We account for the development costs of software intended for sale in accordance with the IntangiblesGoodwill and Other topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification. We monitor the net realizable value of our capitalized software on a quarterly basis based on an estimate of future product revenues. We currently expect to fully recover the value of the capitalized software asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet; however, if future product revenues are less than managements current expectations, we may incur a write-down of capitalized software costs.

For the three months ended July 31, 2018, the 2% increase in revenues over the three months ended July 31, 2017 was attributable primarily to a 96% increase in subscription fees revenues, and to a lesser extent a 6% increase in professional services and maintenance revenues, respectively when compared to the same period last year. This increase was partially offset by a 58% decrease in license revenues.  
License Revenues  
For the three months ended July 31, 2018, license fee revenues decreased 58% when compared to the same period in the prior year. In the three months ended July 31, 2018, license fee revenues from our SCM segment decreased 58% when compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in sales of our products on Logilitys Cloud Services platform that require revenue to be deferred over the life of the contracted period, which is typically one to three years. Our SCM segment constituted approximately 99% and 100% of total license fee revenues for the three months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our Other segment license fee revenues increased by 67% for the three months ended July 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to timing of additional sales to our existing ERP customers.  
The direct sales channel provided approximately 89% of license fee revenues for the three months ended July 31, 2018, compared to approximately 86% in the comparable quarter a year ago. The increase in the proportion of sales by our direct sales channel was due to our indirect channel selling more SaaS contracts than our direct channel. For the three months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, our margins after commissions on direct sales were approximately 92% and 84%, respectively. The increase in margins is due to the mix of sales commission rates based on each individual salespersons quotas and related achievement. For the three months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 50% and 55%, respectively. The indirect channel margins for the current quarter increased compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the mix of value-added reseller (VAR) commission rates. These margin calculations include only commission expense for comparative purposes and do not include other costs of license fees such as amortization of capitalized software.  
Subscription Fees 
For the three months ended July 31, 2018, subscription fees revenues increased by 96% due to the increased subscription fees revenues from our SCM segment which increased sales of our products on our Cloud Services platform that require revenue to be deferred over the life of the contracted period, which is typically one to three years.  
Table of Contents 
For the three months ended July 31, 2018, Cloud Services ACV increased approximately 71% to $13.2 million compared to $7.7 million in the same period of the prior year. ACV is comprised of SaaS of $10.4 million compared to approximately $5.4 million during the same period last year and other cloud services ACV of $2.8 million compared to $2.3 million during the same period last year. ACV is a forward-looking operating measure used by management to better understand cloud services (SaaS and other related cloud services) revenue trends within our business, as it reflects our current estimate of revenue to be generated under existing client contracts in the forward 12-month period.  
Professional Services and other revenues 
For the three months ended July 31, 2018, professional services and other revenues increased by 6% due to the increased services revenues from our IT Consulting segment. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in professional services and other revenues from our Supply Chain Management and Other segments. For the three months ended July 31, 2018, our IT Consulting segments revenues increased 23% when compared to the prior year period due to an increase in project work from existing and new customers when compared to the same period last year. For the three months ended July 31, 2018, our SCM segments revenues decreased 7% due primarily to timing of some implementation project work ending during the quarter before new projects could start. We have observed that there is a tendency for services and other revenues, other than from IT Consulting, to lag changes in license and subscription revenues by one to three quarters, as new licenses and subscriptions in one quarter often involve implementation and consulting services in subsequent quarters, for which we recognize revenues only as we perform those services.  
Maintenance Revenues  
For the three months ended July 31, 2018, maintenance revenues increased 6% when compared to the same period in the prior year. Our SCM maintenance revenue increase 7% when compared to the same period last year due primarily to our recent Halo acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, improved customer retention and increased license fees in recent periods. The SCM segment accounted for 97% and 96% of total maintenance revenues for the three months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Typically, our maintenance revenues have had a direct relationship to current and historic license fee revenues, since new licenses are the potential source of new maintenance customers.  
Table of Contents 
For the three months ended July 31, 2018, our total gross margin percentage decreased when compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to our lower margins on license fee revenue and professional services and other revenue, partially offset by higher margins on subscription fees and maintenance revenue.  
Gross Margin on License Fees  
License fee gross margin percentage for the three months ended July 31, 2018 decreased when compared to the same period in the prior year. License fee gross margin percentage tends to be directly related to the level of license fee revenues due to the relatively fixed cost of computer software amortization expense, amortization of acquired software and the sales mix between our direct and indirect channels.  
Gross Margin on Subscription Fees  
Our gross margin percentage on subscription fees revenues increased from 58% for the three months ended July 31, 2017 to 66% for the three months ended July 31, 2018 primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue, compared to a lower incremental increase in cost.  
Gross Margin on Professional Services and Other  
Our gross margin percentage on professional services and other revenues decreased from 30% for the three months ended July 31, 2017 to 21% for the three months ended July 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to lower gross margins in our SCM segment services of 38% and 19% for the three months ended July 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively due to lower billing utilization from several large projects ending during the quarter. The Other segment remained flat at 38% for the three months ended July 31, 2017 and 2018. Our IT Consulting segment services gross margin increased from 20% and 23% for the three months ended July 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively, due to higher margin projects in the current quarter. Services and other gross margin is directly related to the level of services and other revenues. The primary component of cost of services and other revenues is services staffing, which is relatively inelastic in the short term.  
Gross Margin on Maintenance  
Maintenance gross margin percentage for the three months ended July 31, 2018 increased to 81% from 79% when compared to the same period last year due to an increase in maintenance revenue. The primary component of cost of maintenance revenue is maintenance staffing, which is relatively inelastic in the short term.

Sales and Marketing  
For the three months ended July 31, 2018, sales and marketing expenses remained relatively flat when compared to the same period a year ago.  
General and Administrative  
For the three months ended July 31, 2018, general and administrative expenses increased 19% when compared to the same period a year ago, primarily due to the recent Halo acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and increases in salary and audit fees.  
At July 31, 2018, the total number of employees was 471 compared to 378 at July 31, 2017.  
includes corporate overhead and other common expenses.  
Our SCM segment operating income decreased 48% in the three months ended July 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower revenues and the recent Halo acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.  
Our IT Consulting segments operating income increased by 55% for the three months ended July 31, 2018 compared to same period last year primarily due to increased revenues and gross margins.  
Our Other segment operating loss increased 14% for the three months ended July 31, 2018 when compared to the prior year due to an increase in corporate expenses and a decrease in revenues.  
Other Income  
Other income is comprised of net interest and dividend income, rental income, exchange rate gains and losses, and realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments. For the three months ended July 31, 2018, the increase in other income is primarily due to higher unrealized gains on investments and an increase in interest income when compared to the same period last year. This was partially offset by an exchange rate loss of $247,000 in the current quarter when compared to an exchange rate gain of $41,000 in the same period last year. We recorded a gain of approximately $388,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2018 and a gain of approximately $113,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2017, from our trading securities.

For the three months ended July 31, 2018 and 2017, our investments generated an annualized yield of approximately 1.49% and 1.47%, respectively.  
Operating Pattern  
Sources and Uses of Cash  
We have historically funded, and continue to fund, our operations and capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities. The changes in net cash that our operating activities provide generally reflect the changes in net earnings and non-cash operating items plus the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as investment trading securities, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue. We have no debt obligations or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, and therefore, we used no cash for debt service purposes.  
Table of Contents 
The increase in cash used in investing activities when compared to the same period in the prior year was due primarily to an increase in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by lower capitalized computer software development costs.  
The decrease in cash used in financing activities compared to the prior year was due primarily to an increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options, partially offset by an increase in dividends paid.  
Our total activities used less cash and investments during the three months ended July 31, 2018, when compared to the prior year period, primarily due to normal business operations.  
Days Sales Outstanding in accounts receivable were 57 days as of July 31, 2018, compared to 56 days as of July 31, 2017. This increase is primarily due to timing of cash collections. Our current ratio on July 31, 2018 was 2.8 to 1 and on July 31, 2017 was2.7 to 1.  
Our business in recent periods has generated substantial positive cash flow from operations, excluding purchases and proceeds of sale of trading securities. For this reason, and because we had $87.4 million in cash and investments with no debt as of July 31, 2018, we believe that our sources of liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our presently anticipated requirements during at least the next twelve months for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate needs. However, at some future date we may need to seek additional sources of capital to meet our requirements. If such need arises, we may be required to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. We do not currently have a bank line of credit. We can provide no assurance that bank lines of credit or other financing will be available on terms acceptable to us. If available, such financing may result in dilution to our shareholders or higher interest expense.
