 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
 $236,000 for the three months and nine months ended January 31, 2017, respectively. We estimate that a 10% movement in foreign currency rates would have had the effect of creating up to a $456,000 and $455,000 exchange gain or loss for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, respectively. We have not engaged in any hedging activities.  
Interest Rates and Other Market Risks. We have no debt, and therefore limit our discussion of interest rate risk to risk associated with our investment profile. We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio of trading investments with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities. These instruments include, but are not limited to, money-market instruments, bank time deposits, and taxable and tax-advantaged variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations, municipalities, and national, state, and local government agencies, in accordance with an investment policy approved by our Board of Directors. These instruments are denominated in U.S. Dollars. The fair market value of these instruments as of January 31, 2018 was approximately $84.0 million compared to $72.8 million as of January 31, 2017.  
We also hold cash balances in accounts with commercial banks in the United States and foreign countries. These cash balances represent operating balances only and are invested in short-term time deposits of the local bank. Such operating cash balances held at banks outside the United States are denominated in the local currency and are minor.
