Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk 



Foreign Currency 



We have foreign operations in The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, China, Portugal, Canada and Mexico, which expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to transactions denominated in Euros, Swedish Krona, Chinese Renminbi, Canadian dollar and Mexican pesos, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018 we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased sales by $6,300 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017.
The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income.
The translation adjustment was a loss of approximately $3,500 and a gain of approximately $3,100 for the second quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the translation adjustment was a loss of approximately $1,800 and a gain of approximately $3,800, respectively.
Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to a gain of $294 and a loss of $87 for the second quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.
For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net were a gain of $156 and a loss of $153, respectively.
A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $7,470 on our foreign net assets as of June 30, 2018.
Interest Rates 



Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 1.50%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 0.50%), in each case depending on the CompanyÂ’s ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA.
We use interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.
We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy.
Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 (representing 50% of the Term Loan balance at that time) that amortize quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at maturity.
The notional amount changes over time as loan payments are made.
As a requirement of the debt refinance, one of the swaps was liquidated.
In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022.
As of June 30, 2018, we had $64,982 outstanding under the Revolving Facility, of which $43,337 is currently being hedged.
A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) change in the Base Rate on the $21,645 of unhedged floating rate debt outstanding at June 30, 2018 would have an impact of approximately $54 on our interest expense for the second quarter 2018 and $108 on our interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
