Sources of Revenue  



We derive revenue from two principal sources: licensing our design assets and technology to brands and creative professionals, which we refer to as our Creative Professional revenue, and licensing our text imaging solutions to consumer device manufacturers and independent software vendors, which we refer to as our OEM revenue.
We derive our Creative Professional revenue primarily from brands, agencies, publishers, corporations, enterprises, small businesses and individuals.
We derive our OEM revenue primarily from consumer device manufacturers.
We classify cloud-based subscriptions and other services, such as font related services, custom font design and post contract support as service revenue.
All other revenue is classified as license revenue.
We operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.
Geographic revenue, which is based on the geographic location of our customers, is in the table below:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, revenue from customers outside the United States comprised 54.8% and 56.2%, respectively, of our total revenue.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, our top ten licensees by revenue, most of which are OEM customers, accounted for approximately 24.6% and 23.0% of our total revenue, respectively.
No one customer accounted for more than 10.0% of our total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2019 or 2018.
Cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquired technology, which we amortize over 7 to 15 years.
We use the straight-line method to amortize acquired technology.
Creative Professional revenue is growing at a faster rate than OEM revenue.
We expect these trends to continue.
Our gross profit is subject to variability from period-to-period, depending on the product mix and the level of custom font design and SaaS based service revenue.

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2018  



Revenue and cost of revenue, bifurcated into license and service, is as follows:  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



License revenue decreased primarily due to the decline in printer revenue from our printer imaging electronic customers and a decline in revenue from our web channels in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018.
Service revenue decreased in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly due to increased customer churn in the last half of 2018.
Gross profit from license revenue, before amortization of acquired technology, increased to 83.9% from 79.0% mainly due to the one-time additional non-recurring royalty expense in the three months ended March 31, 2018, for which there was no corresponding revenue in the period, in accordance with ASC 606.
There was no similar charge in the same period in 2019.
See further discussion below for additional information regarding our period over period revenue and cost of revenue.
While revenue from services has grown to a level of significance requiring separate disclosure, we continue to operate our business based on our two principal markets, Creative Professional and OEM, which is the basis for the following discussion of operating results.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The following discussion compares the three months ended March 31, 2019 with the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Revenue by Market  



We view our operations and manage our business as one segment: the development, marketing and licensing of technologies and fonts.
While our technologies and services are sold to customers in two principal markets, Creative Professional and consumer device manufacturers and independent software vendors, together OEM, expenses and assets are not formally allocated to these markets, and operating results are assessed on an aggregate basis to make decisions about the allocation of resources.
The following table presents revenue for these two principal markets (in thousands):  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Revenue  



Revenue was $51.4 million and $56.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $5.3 million, or 9.4%.
OEM revenue decreased $3.1 million, or 14.3%, to $18.6 million in the first quarter of 2019, as compared to $21.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, mainly due to a decline in printer revenue.
The decrease in printer revenue, period over period, is largely due to a decline in revenue from our printer imaging electronic OEM customers.
Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit  



Cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, decreased $2.8 million, or 22.8%, to $9.6 million and $12.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In the first quarter of 2018, there was $2.2 million of non-recurring royalty expense in connection with the adoption of ASC 606.
As a percentage of sales, cost of revenue, excluding amortization of acquired technology, was 18.7% and 22.0% of total revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decline of 3.3%.
The portion of cost of revenue consisting of amortization of acquired technology was unchanged at $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Gross profit increased 3.1% to 79.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to 76.5% in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase in gross profit in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, was primarily due to the one-time additional non-recurring royalty expense in the prior period that did not occur in the current period, as described above.
Operating Expenses  



Marketing and Selling.
Marketing and selling expense decreased $3.0 million, or 14.7%, to $17.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $20.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to lower personnel expenses.
Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to lower headcount from our restructuring actions in the second and fourth quarters of 2018 and other decreases in headcount and lower variable compensation as a result of lower revenue.
Targeted marketing spending decreased $0.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, due to portfolio decisions around discretionary programs.
Research and Development.
Research and development expense decreased $1.9 million, or 20.0%, to $7.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $9.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to lower personnel expenses.
Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased mainly due to lower headcount from restructuring actions in the second and fourth quarters of 2018.
General and Administrative.
General and administrative expense decreased $3.6 million, or 23.0%, to $12.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $15.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Outside consulting and legal expenses decreased $3.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to additional expenses incurred in the prior period related to shareholder activities.
Personnel and personnel related expenses decreased $0.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018, mainly the result of restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Restructuring.
Restructuring expense decreased $0.2 million, or 112.4%, due to a credit of $24 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2019 from $0.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 due to severance expense and charges associated with the closure of one of our regional offices in the prior period.
Amortization of Other Intangible Assets.
Amortization of other intangible assets was $0.8 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 18.8%, mainly due to the write off intangible assets associated with the Swyft business in the second quarter of 2018.

Interest Expense, Net  



Interest expense, net of interest income was $0.8 million and $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase of $0.1 million, or 5.9%, mainly due to borrowings under our revolving lines of credit.
Loss (Gain) on Foreign Exchange  



Loss (gain) on foreign exchange was a loss of $66 thousand and gain of $34 thousand in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Loss on Derivatives  



Loss on derivatives was $0.1 million and $0.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, the net result of changes in the market value of our 30-day forward currency derivative contracts.
Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes  



For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, our effective tax rate was a benefit of 5.5% and a provision of 67.3%, respectively.
Following is a more detailed discussion of the decrease in the effective rate:  



       



The impact of foreign earnings increased our effective tax rate by 3.6% in the first quarter of 2019, as compared to 33.8% in the same period in 2018, due to our ability to better utilize foreign tax credits and to limit the amount of income subject to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions.
In the prior period, these provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (The Act) resulted in a significantly higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings due to limitations on the Companys ability to utilize foreign tax credits in the first quarter of 2018.
    



The Company has reflected a reduction in its valuation allowance for foreign tax credits, resulting in a benefit of 10.2%, related to the amount of foreign tax credit carryforwards that the Company is estimating that it will be able to utilize based on 2019 taxable income.
    



Non-deductible expenses added 2.4% to the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to 8.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a result of the acceleration of the final payment of deferred compensation to the founders of Swyft in June 2018 and to two of the founders of Olapic in December 2018, both of which lowered the total amount of non-deductible compensation in the current period.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  



Information concerning recently issued accounting pronouncements may be found in Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Liquidity and Capital Resources  



Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations, private and public stock sales and long-term debt arrangements, as described below.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, our cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements.
At March 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $46.4 million and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, of which there was $70.0 million of outstanding borrowings.
On May 3, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $25.0 million of our outstanding common stock, which permits purchases through June 7, 2019.
For the three months ended March 31, 2019, we used $6.6 million in cash to purchase shares under the plan.
As of March 31, 2019 the plan has $1.1 million available for future purchases.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Operating Activities  



We generated $4.1 million in cash from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Net income, after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, loss extinguishment of debt, loss on retirement of assets, amortization of deferred financing costs, accreted interest, stock based compensation, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes, and unrealized currency gain on foreign denominated intercompany transactions generated $10.6 million in cash.

Increased tax refunds receivable combined with decreased accrued income taxes used $3.2 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2019.
Variations in operating cash flows occur from time-to-time because our enterprise customers make upfront payments on subscription revenue.
The timing and extent of such payments may significantly impact our cash balances.

Credit Facility  



On March 22, 2019, the Company entered into a new credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement) by and among the Company, the Companys subsidiary, Monotype Imaging Inc., (the Borrower), any financial institution that becomes a Lender and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent.
Pursuant to the New Credit Agreement the Lenders have agreed to provide the Borrower with a five-year $200.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility).
The Credit Facility permits the Company to request that the Lenders, at their election, increase the secured credit facility to a maximum of $300.0 million.
The Credit Facility provides more flexibility in addition to an increased borrowing capacity and extended terms, as defined above.
The New Credit Agreement replaced the Companys existing $150.0 million revolving credit facility (the Original Credit Agreement) by and between the Company and Silicon Valley Bank.
The Original Credit Agreement was terminated effective March 22, 2019 and was scheduled to expire on September 15, 2020.
The Company had $75.0 million outstanding under the Original Credit Agreement at December 31, 2018.
Available borrowings under the Original Credit Agreement were reduced by approximately $0.5 million for one standby letter of credit issued in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $74.5 million available for borrowings at December 31, 2018.
At March 31, 2019, the Company had $70.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.
Available borrowings under the Credit Facility have been reduced by approximately $0.5 million for one standby letter of credit issued in connection with a facility lease agreement, leaving $129.5 million available for borrowings at March 31, 2019.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest through March 21, 2024 at a variable rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus between 1.0% and 1.625%, or at the Borrowers option, the higher of (i) the prime rate as announced by Bank of America and (ii) 0.5% plus the overnight federal funds rate, plus in each case, between 0.0% and 0.625%, with the exact interest rate margin determined based on the consolidated leverage ratio.
At March 31, 2019, our rate, inclusive of applicable margins, was 3.6% for LIBOR.
At December 31, 2018, our rate under the Original Credit Agreement, inclusive of applicable margins, was 4.3% for LIBOR.
The Company is required to pay a commitment fee, based on the consolidated leverage ratio, equal to 0.175%, 0.20%, 0.225% or 0.25% per annum on the undrawn portion available under the revolving credit facility and variable per annum fees in respect of outstanding letters of credit.
In connection with the New Credit Agreement, the Company incurred closing and legal fees of approximately $0.9 million, which have been accounted for as deferred financing costs and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the New Credit Agreement.
In addition, $34.0 thousand of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the pro-rata share of prior loan syndicate lenders that did not participate in the new facility were written off and charged to other expense in the first quarter of 2019.
The New Credit Agreement includes financial covenants which require the Company to maintain (i) a consolidated leverage ratio of no greater than 3.25 to 1.0 or, upon a qualified acquisition subject to certain conditions, 3.75 to 1.0 and (ii) a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.0.
At March 31, 2019, our consolidated leverage ratio was 0.72 to 1.0 and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was 18.61 to 1.0.
The New Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for transactions of this type and other affirmative and negative covenants agreed to by the parties, including, among others, limits on the Company and its subsidiaries ability to incur debt or liens, engage in sale-leaseback transactions, make loans, investments and acquisitions, incur additional indebtedness, engage in mergers, enter into asset sales, transact with affiliates and alter its business.
Adjusted EBITDA, under the Credit Facility, is defined as consolidated net earnings (or loss), plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and share based compensation expense, plus acquisition expenses not to exceed $2.0 million, minus capitalized research and development expense, plus restructuring, issuance costs, cash non-operating costs and other expenses or losses minus cash non-operating gains and other non-cash gains; provided, however that the aggregate of all cash non-operating expense shall not exceed 10% of Consolidated EBITDA.
The New Credit Agreement also provides for a number of customary events of default, including, among others, payment, bankruptcy, covenant, representation and warranty, change of control and judgment defaults.
Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of an event of default, could permit the Lenders under the New Credit Agreement to declare all amounts borrowed under the New Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable.
The obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries and secured by a lien on substantially all of the present and future property and assets of the Company and such subsidiaries, in each case, subject to limited exceptions and exclusions.
The Credit Facility also contains provisions for an increased interest rate during periods of default.
We do not believe that these covenants will affect our ability to operate our business, and we were in compliance with all covenants under our Credit Facility as of March 31, 2019.
This non-GAAP measure is net adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock based compensation expense, acquisition-related compensation and one-time non-recurring expenses.
We use net adjusted EBITDA as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business.
This non-GAAP measure is non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, which is defined as earnings per diluted share before amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock based compensation expenses, acquisition-related compensation and one-time non-recurring expenses.
The following table presents a reconciliation from net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP operating financial measure, to net adjusted EBITDA as used by management (in thousands):

For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the amount includes $0.2 million, or $0.01 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Olapic acquisition.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the amount includes $0.9 million, or $0.02 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Olapic acquisition and $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share, of expense associated with the deferred compensation arrangement resulting from the Amendment to the Swyft Merger Agreement.

For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the amount includes ($24) thousand of restructuring expenses.
(3)  



For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the amount includes ($18) thousand, or $0.00 per share, net of tax, of restructuring expenses.
For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the amount includes $2.1 million, or $0.05 per share, net of tax, of certain advisor fees related to shareholder activities, $1.7 million, or $0.04 per share, net of tax, of royalty expenses, recorded in cost of sales, associated with revenue that was not recognized under ASC 606 and $0.1 million, or $0.00 per share, net of tax, of restructuring expenses.
(4)  



Net adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP profitability measures such as income (loss) from operations and net income (loss).
We have significant intangible assets and amortization expense is a meaningful element in our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation.
Stock based compensation and the associated expense has a meaningful impact on our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from net adjusted EBITDA is a material limitation.
As a result, net adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income (loss) for complete analysis of our profitability, as net income (loss) includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable GAAP performance measure to net adjusted EBITDA.
As net adjusted EBITDA is not defined by GAAP, our definition of net adjusted EBITDA may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.
