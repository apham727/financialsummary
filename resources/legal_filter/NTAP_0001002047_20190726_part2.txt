Item 1.
Legal Proceedings.
For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 17 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Item 1A.
Risk Factors.
The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.
These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-Q or elsewhere.
The following information should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes in Part I, Item 1 – Financial Statements and Part I, Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-Q.
The following discussion reflects our current judgment regarding the most significant risks we face.
These risks can and will change in the future.
Our business may be harmed by technological trends in our market or if we are unable to keep pace with rapid industry, technological and market changes.
Our industry and the markets in which we compete have historically experienced significant growth due to the increase in the demand for storage and data management solutions by consumers, enterprises and government bodies around the world, and the resultant purchases of storage and data management solutions to address this demand.
However, despite continued data growth, our traditional market, the networked storage hardware market, experienced a decline in each of the last three calendar years due to a combination of customers delaying purchases in the face of technology transitions, increasing adoption of Cloud environments built on commodity hardware, increased storage efficiency, and changing economic and business environments.
While customers are navigating through their information technology (IT) transformations, which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments, they are also reducing IT budgets, looking for simpler solutions, and rethinking how they consume IT.
This evolution is diverting spending towards transformational projects and architectures like flash, hybrid cloud, IT as a service, converged infrastructure, and software defined storage.
As a result of these and other factors discussed in the report, our revenue may decline on a year-over-year basis, as it did in fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017.
The future impact of these trends on both short-term and long-term growth patterns is uncertain.
If we are unable to develop, introduce and gain market acceptance for new products and services while managing the transition from older ones, or if we cannot provide the expected level of quality and support for our new products and services, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.
Our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products and services.
Due to the complexity of storage software, subsystems and appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products and services, such products and services are subject to significant technical and quality control risks.
New or additional product introductions, including new hardware and software offerings, such as NetApp HCI, Cloud Volumes ONTAP, and new all flash storage products, subject us to additional financial and operational risks, including our ability to forecast customer preferences and/or demand, our ability to successfully manage the transition from older products and solutions, our ability to forecast the impact of customers’ demand for new products, services and solutions or the products being replaced, and our ability to manage production capacity to meet the demand for new products and services.
In addition, as new or enhanced products and services  



42 



are introduced, we must also avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and related components and ensure that new products and services can be delivered to meet customers’ demands.
Further risks inherent in the introduction of new products, services and solutions include the uncertainty of price-performance relative to products of competitors, competitors’ responses to the introductions, delays in sales caused by the desire of customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time and our partners’ investment in selling our new products and solutions.
We may not be able to provide products, service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities.
We offer customers a full range of consumption models, including the deployment of our software through our subscription and cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS), and utility pricing and managed services offerings for our hardware and software systems.
These business models continue to evolve, and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our consumption-based offerings.
As customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases, we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional hardware and software license arrangements, including for the software license components of enterprise software license agreements (for which revenue is generally recognized in full at the time of delivery), relative to our consumption model offerings, (for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement).
We incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructure and marketing of our consumption model offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings.
Our business and sales models make revenues difficult to forecast.
We sell to a variety of customers directly and through various channels, with a corresponding variety of sales cycles, and we recently reorganized our sales resources to improve the alignment of those resources with customer and market opportunities.
The majority of our sales are made and/or fulfilled indirectly through channel partners, including value-added resellers, systems integrators, distributors, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and strategic business partners, which now include hyperscalers.
This structure significantly complicates our ability to forecast future revenue, especially within any particular fiscal quarter or year.
Moreover, our relationships with our indirect channel partners and strategic business partners are critical to our success.
The loss of one or more of our key indirect channel partners in a given geographic area or the failure of our channel or strategic partners to promote our products could harm our operating results.
Qualifying and developing new indirect channel partners typically requires a significant investment of time and resources before acceptable levels of productivity are met.
Increasing competition and industry consolidation could harm our business and operating results.
The storage and data management markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and fragmentation.
We compete with many companies in the markets we serve, including established public companies, newer public companies with a strong flash focus, and new market entrants addressing the growing opportunity for hyper-converged systems.
Some offer a broad spectrum of IT products and services (full-stack vendors) and others offer a more limited set of storage and data management products or services.
Technology trends, such as the emergence of hosted or public cloud storage, SaaS and flash storage are driving significant changes in storage architectures and solution requirements.
Cloud service providers provide customers storage for their data centers on demand, without requiring a capital expenditure, which meets rapidly evolving business needs and has changed the competitive landscape.
By extending our flash, converged infrastructure and cloud storage offerings, we are competing in new segments with both traditional competitors and new competitors, particularly smaller emerging storage vendors.
The longer-term potential and competitiveness of these emerging vendors remains to be determined.
In cloud and converged infrastructure, we also compete with large well-established competitors.
43 



For additional information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled “Competition” contained in Item 1 – Business of Part I of this Form 10-K.
It is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors might emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share or buying power.
An increase in industry consolidation might result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as full-stack vendors for customers and achieve increased economies of scale in the supply chain.
For example, in October 2016, Dell Inc. and EMC Corp. consummated their agreement to merge.
Also, in April 2017, HP Enterprise completed their acquisition of Nimble Storage.
In addition, current and potential competitors have established or might establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including some of our partners or suppliers.
Continuing global economic uncertainty, political conditions and fiscal challenges in the United States (U.S.) and abroad have, among other things, limited our ability to forecast future demand for our products, contributed to increased periodic volatility in the computer, storage and networking industries at large, as well as the IT market, and could constrain future access to capital for our suppliers, customers and partners.
The impacts of these circumstances are global and pervasive, and the timing and nature of any ultimate resolution of these matters remain highly uncertain.
In addition to those matters, we face the following issues, which could impact our quarterly results: 



•  



Seasonality, such as our historical seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year and seasonal increase in revenues in the second quarter of our fiscal year, with the latter due in part to the impact of the U.S. federal government’s September 30 fiscal year end on the timing of its orders; and 



•  



Linearity, such as our historical intra-quarter bookings and revenue pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter’s total bookings and related revenue occur in the last month of the quarter; and 



•  



Unpredictability associated with larger scale enterprise software license agreements which generally take longer to negotiate and occur less consistently than other types of contracts, and for which revenue attributable to the software license component is typically recognized in full upon delivery.
If we are unable to maintain and develop relationships with strategic partners, our revenues may be harmed.
Our growth strategy includes developing and maintaining strategic partnerships with major third-party software and hardware vendors to integrate our products into their products and also co-market our products with them.
A number of our strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage and data management markets.
In particular, strategic partnerships with hyperscalers and cloud service vendors are critical to the success of our cloud-based business.
However, there is intense competition for attractive strategic partners, and these relationships may not be exclusive, may not generate significant revenues and may be terminated on short notice.
For instance, some of our partners are also partnering with our competitors, which may increase the availability of competing solutions and harm our ability to grow our relationships with those partners.
Moreover, some of our partners, particularly large, more diversified technology companies, are also competitors, thereby complicating our relationships.
If we are unable to establish new partnerships or maintain existing partnerships, if our strategic partners favor their relationships with other vendors in the storage industry or if our strategic partners increasingly compete with us, we could experience lower than expected revenues, suffer delays in product development, or experience other harm to our business, operating results and financial condition.
A portion of our revenues is generated by large, recurring purchases from various customers, resellers and distributors.
A loss, cancellation or delay in purchases by any of these parties has negatively affected our revenues in the past, and could negatively affect our revenues in the future.
A significant portion of our net revenues are generated through sales to a limited number of customers and distributors.
We generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments with our customers, resellers and distributors for extended periods of time, and thus there is no guarantee we will continue to receive large, recurring orders from these customers, resellers or distributors.
For example, our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases, and our customers, resellers and distributors can stop purchasing and marketing our products at any time.
In addition, unfavorable economic conditions may negatively impact the solvency  



44 



of our customers, resellers and distributors or the ability of such customers, resellers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products.
Our gross margins vary.
Our gross margins reflect a variety of factors, including competitive pricing, component and product design, and the volume and relative mix of revenues from product, software maintenance, hardware maintenance and other services offerings.
Increased component costs, increased pricing and discounting pressures, the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product prices, or changes in the mix of revenue or decreased volume from product, software maintenance, hardware maintenance and other services offerings could harm our revenues, gross margins or earnings.
Our gross margins are also impacted by the cost of any materials that are of poor quality and our sales and distribution activities, including, without limitation, pricing actions, rebates, sales initiatives and discount levels, and the timing of service contract renewals.
The costs of third-party components comprise a significant portion of our product costs.
While we generally have been able to manage our component and product design costs, we may have difficulty managing these costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase.
If we do not achieve forecasted bookings in any quarter, our financial results could be harmed.
Bookings typically follow intra-quarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter.
If we do not achieve the level, timing and mix of bookings consistent with our quarterly targets and historical patterns, or if we experience cancellations of significant orders, our financial results could be harmed.
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for critical product components.
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for drives and other components utilized in the assembly of our products, including certain single source suppliers, which has subjected us, and could in the future subject us, to price rigidity, periodic supply constraints, and the inability to produce our products with the quality and in the quantities demanded.
Consolidation among suppliers, particularly within the semiconductor and disk drive industries, has contributed to price rigidity and may in the future create supply constraints.
When industry supply is constrained, our suppliers may allocate volumes away from us and to our competitors, all of which rely on many of the same suppliers as we do.
Accordingly, our operating results may be harmed.
We do not manufacture our products or their components.
Instead, we rely on third parties to make our products and critical components, such as disk drives, as well as for associated logistics.
Our lack of direct responsibility for, and control over, these elements of our business, as well as the diverse international geographic locations of our manufacturing partners and suppliers, creates significant risks for us, including, among other things:  



•Limited ability to control the quality, quantity and cost of our products or of their components; 



•The potential for binding price or purchase commitments with our suppliers at higher than market rates; 



•Limited ability to adjust production volumes in response to our customers’ demand fluctuations; 



•Labor and political unrest at facilities we do not operate or own; 



•Geopolitical disputes disrupting our supply chain; 



•Business, legal compliance, litigation and financial concerns affecting our suppliers or their ability to manufacture and ship our products in the quantities, quality and manner we require; and 



•Disruptions due to floods, earthquakes, storms and other natural disasters, particularly in countries with limited infrastructure and disaster recovery resources.
The risks associated with our outsourced manufacturing model are particularly acute when we transition products to new facilities or manufacturers, introduce and increase volumes of new products or qualify new contract manufacturers or suppliers, at which times our ability to manage the relationships  



45 



among us, our manufacturing partners and our component suppliers, becomes critical.
New manufacturers, products, components or facilities create increased costs and risk that we will fail to deliver high quality products in the required volumes to our customers.
Any failure of a manufacturer or component supplier to meet our quality, quantity or delivery requirements in a cost-effective manner will harm our business, operating results and customer relationships.
Due to the global nature of our business, risks inherent in our international operations could materially harm our business.
A significant portion of our operations are located, and a significant portion of our revenues are derived, outside of the U.S.
Accordingly, our business and future operating results could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our international operations including, among other things, local political or economic conditions, trade protection and export and import requirements, tariffs, local labor conditions, transportation costs, government spending patterns, acts of terrorism, international conflicts and natural disasters in areas with limited infrastructure.
In particular, the current trade tensions between the U.S. and China, including newly imposed tariffs, and the United Kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the European Union, which is now scheduled to be effective on October 31, 2019, could impact our business and operating results.
For products we manufacture in Mexico, tensions between the U.S. and Mexico related to trade and border security issues could delay our shipments to customers, or impact pricing or our business and operating results.
In addition, due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products, including antitrust and anti-competition laws, rules and regulations, and regulations related to data privacy.
We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations.
These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.
We utilize forward and option contracts in an attempt to reduce the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities.
In addition, our foreign currency exposure on assets, liabilities and cash flows that we do not hedge could have a material impact on our financial results in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to foreign currencies.
Moreover, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures, or U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
There can be no assurance that all our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will comply with these policies, procedures, laws and/or regulations.
We often incur expenses before we receive related benefits, and expenses may be difficult to reduce quickly if demand declines.
We base our expense levels in part on future revenue expectations and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed.
It is difficult to reduce our fixed costs quickly, and if revenue levels are below our expectations, operating results could be adversely impacted.
During periods of uneven growth or decline, we may incur costs before we realize the anticipated related benefits, which could also harm our operating results.
We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in engineering, sales, service and support, marketing and other functions to support and grow our business.
Our effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.
We receive significant tax benefits from sales to our non-U.S. customers.
Future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations or a change in how we manage our international operations could adversely affect our ability to continue realizing these tax benefits.
Many countries around the world are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and related action plans that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation  



46 



rules and nexus-based tax incentive practices.
As a result, many of these changes, if enacted, could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.
Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations, which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole.
Changes to interpretations of the law could change the amount or accounting treatment of the expense we have recorded in relation to the transition tax.
We have elected to pay the transition tax over a period of eight years.
As result, our cash flows from operating activities will be adversely impacted until the additional tax provisions are paid in full.
Our clients, including data centers, SaaS, cloud computing and internet infrastructure and bandwidth providers, rely on our products for their data storage needs.
Our clients may authorize third-party technology providers to access their data on our systems.
Because we do not control the transmissions between our clients, their customers, and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions or processing.
Errors or wrongdoing by clients, their customers, or third-party technology providers resulting in security breaches may be attributed to us.
A failure or inability to meet our clients’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality through a disruption in the services provided by these third-party vendors, or the loss of data stored by such vendors, could result in financial or reputational harm to our business to the extent that such disruption or loss is caused by, or perceived by our customers to have been caused by, defects in our products.
Moreover, the risk of reputational harm may be magnified and/or distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet, including through news articles, blogs, chat rooms, and social media sites.
This may affect our ability to retain clients and attract new business.
We store and transmit personal, sensitive and proprietary data related to our products, our employees, customers, clients and partners (including third-party vendors such as data centers and providers of SaaS, cloud computing, and internet infrastructure and bandwidth), and their respective customers, including intellectual property, books of record and personal information.
It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure, products and services remain secure and are perceived by customers, clients and partners to be secure.
There are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, human error and technological vulnerabilities.
Cybersecurity incidents or other security breaches could result in (1) unauthorized access to, or loss or unauthorized disclosure of, such information; (2) litigation, indemnity obligations, government investigations and other possible liabilities; (3) negative publicity; and (4) disruptions to our internal and external operations.
In addition, a cybersecurity incident or loss of personal information could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs and lost revenues.
Our clients and customers use our platforms for the transmission and storage of sensitive data.
We do not review the information or content that our clients and their customers upload and store, and, therefore, we have no direct control over the substance of the information or content stored within our platforms.
High-profile cyberattacks and security breaches have increased in recent years, and security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting IT products and businesses.
Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
As we continue to increase our client base and expand our brand, we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems and we  



47 



anticipate that hacking attempts and cyberattacks will increase in the future.
We cannot give assurance that we will always be successful in preventing or repelling unauthorized access to our systems.
Many jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting laws requiring companies to notify regulators or individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data.
These mandatory disclosures regarding security incidents often lead to widespread negative publicity.
Moreover, the risk of reputational harm may be magnified and/or distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet, including through news articles, blogs, chat rooms, and social media sites.
Our business could be subject to stricter obligations, greater fines and private causes of action under the enactment of new data privacy laws, including but not limited to, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation enacted on May 25, 2018 and the California Consumer Privacy Act to be enacted on January 1, 2020.
Our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claim.
The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning, forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions.
In response to changes in market conditions and market demand for our products, we have in the past undertaken cost savings initiatives.
For example, in March 2016, November 2016, May 2018, April 2019 and May 2019 we executed restructuring events designed to streamline our business, reduce our cost structure and focus our resources on key strategic opportunities.
As a result, we have recognized substantial restructuring charges.
In fiscal 2018, we created the Storage Systems and Software, Cloud Data Services, and Cloud Infrastructure business units to enable us to develop the organization and systems to successfully execute a multi-product business.
We also reorganized our sales resources to better align with customer and market opportunities.
We may in the future undertake initiatives that could include reorganizing our workforce, restructuring, disposing of, and/or otherwise discontinuing certain products, or a combination of these actions.
Rapid changes in the size, alignment or organization of our workforce, including our new business unit structure and sales account coverage, could adversely affect our ability to develop, sell and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives.
Any decision to take these actions may result in charges to earnings associated with, among other things, inventory or other fixed, intangible or goodwill asset reductions (including, without limitation, impairment charges), workforce and facility reductions and penalties and claims from third-party resellers or users of discontinued products.
Charges associated with these activities would harm our operating results.
In addition to the costs associated with these activities, we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the underlying restructuring activities.
Our hardware and software products are complex.
We have experienced in the past, and expect to experience in the future, quality issues.
Such quality issues may be due to, for example, our own designs or processes, the designs or processes of our suppliers, and/or flaws in third-party software used in our products.
Quality risk is most acute when we are introducing new products.
We have also increased the cadence of our product release cycle, which could impact product and service quality.
Quality issues have and could again in the future cause customers to experience outages or disruptions in service, data loss or data corruption.
In addition, we exercise little control over how our customers use or maintain our products, and in some cases improper usage or maintenance could impair the performance of our products, which could lead to a perception of a quality issue.
48 



Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and to preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture.
Because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products, we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers, including in emerging areas of technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.
In addition, to increase revenues, we will be required to increase the productivity of our sales force and support infrastructure to achieve adequate customer coverage.
Competition for qualified employees, particularly in Silicon Valley, is intense.
We have periodically reduced our workforce, including an 11% reduction announced in March 2016, a 6% reduction announced in November 2016, and more minor reductions announced in fiscal 2019 and 2020, and these actions may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees.
Our inability to hire and retain qualified management and skilled personnel, particularly engineers, salespeople and key executive management, could be disruptive to our development efforts, sales results, business relationships and/or our ability to execute our business plan and strategy on a timely basis and could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
Equity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs.
If we reduce, modify or eliminate our equity programs, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees.
In addition, because of the structure of our sales, cash and equity incentive compensation plans, we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times.
For example, the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of annual bonuses or the vesting of equity awards.
As part of our strategy, we seek to acquire other businesses and technologies to complement our current products, expand the breadth of our markets, or enhance our technical capabilities.
For example, in May 2019 (fiscal 2020), we acquired a privately held company, in fiscal 2018 we acquired two privately held companies, and in fiscal 2016 we acquired SolidFire, Inc.
The benefits we have received, and expect to receive, from these and other acquisitions depend on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence, negotiate the terms of the acquisition and integrate the acquired business into our systems, procedures and organizational structure.
The failure to achieve expected acquisition benefits may also result in impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets.
In addition, we could be harmed by claims that we have or a channel partner has failed to comply with regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the U.S. government.
The U.S. government is an important customer for us.
However, government demand is uncertain, as it is subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints.
Events such as the U.S. federal government shutdown from December 2018 to January 2019 and continued uncertainty regarding the U.S. budget and debt levels have increased demand uncertainty for our products, and in our fiscal 2016 resulted in lower sales to these customers.
In addition, like other customers, the U.S. government may evaluate competing products and delay purchasing in the face of the technology transitions taking place in the storage industry.
If the U.S. government or an individual agency or multiple agencies within the U.S. government continue to reduce or shift their IT spending patterns, our revenues and operating results may be harmed.
Selling our products to the U.S. government, whether directly or through channel partners, also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements.
As an example, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the General Services Administration (GSA) have in the past pursued claims against and financial settlements with IT vendors, including us and several of our competitors and channel partners, under the False Claims Act and other statutes related to pricing and discount practices and compliance with certain provisions of GSA contracts for sales to the federal government.
Although the DOJ and GSA currently have no claims pending against us, we could face claims in the future.
Violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements, including with respect to data security, could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting.
We continuously seek to make our cost structure and business processes more efficient, including by moving our business activities from higher-cost to lower-cost locations, outsourcing certain business processes and functions, and implementing changes to our business information systems.
These efforts involve a significant investment of financial and human resources and significant changes to our current operating processes.
In addition, as we move operations into lower-cost jurisdictions and outsource certain business  



49 



processes, we become subject to new regulatory regimes and lose control of certain aspects of our operations and, as a consequence, become more dependent upon the systems and business processes of third-parties.
As of July 26, 2019, we had $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness for our senior notes that mature at specific dates in calendar years 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2024, and we had an aggregate of $30 million of commercial paper notes outstanding with a maturity of 29 days.
We may incur additional indebtedness in the future under existing credit facilities and/or enter into new financing arrangements.
We may fail to pay these or additional future obligations, as and when required.
Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s Rating Services may adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the terms of such financing and reduce the market capacity for our commercial paper.
Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon any potential future financing, then interest expense related to the refinance indebtedness would increase.
In addition, all our debt and credit facility arrangements subject us to continued compliance with restrictive and financial covenants.
If we do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts borrowed under these agreements.
We are exposed to credit risks and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.
We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities.
Credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors.
As a result, the value and liquidity of our investments may fluctuate substantially.
Therefore, although we have not recently realized any significant losses on our investments, future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss.
Our failure to adjust to emerging standards in the storage and data management industry may harm our business.
Emerging standards in the storage and data management markets may adversely affect the UNIX®, Windows® and World Wide Web server markets upon which we depend.
For example, we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services, healthcare, pharmaceutical and government market segments, industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access, reliability and permanence in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate.
If our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard, customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products, and we may not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates which we have forecasted.
Some of our products are subject to U.S. export control laws and other laws affecting the countries in which our products and services may be sold, distributed, or delivered, and any violation of these laws could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and the trade and economic sanctions regulations administered by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
The U.S., through the BIS and OFAC, places restrictions on the sale or export of certain products and services to certain countries and persons.
Violators of these export control and sanctions laws may be subject to significant penalties, which may include significant monetary fines, criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees, a denial of export privileges, and suspension or debarment from selling products to the federal government.
Our products could be shipped to those targets by third parties, including potentially our channel partners, despite our precautions.
Even if we were not found to have violated such laws, the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause us significant expense and reputational harm.
Changes in regulations relating to our products or their components, or the manufacture, sourcing, distribution or use thereof, may harm our business and operating results.
50 



The laws and regulations governing the manufacturing, sourcing, distribution and use of our products have become more complex and stringent over time.
For example, in addition to various environmental laws relating to carbon emissions and the use and discharge of hazardous materials, the SEC adopted regulations concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries.
We incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements of this law and may realize other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products.
Further, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins of the minerals used in the products we sell.
As the laws and regulations governing our products continue to expand and change, our costs are likely to rise, and the failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could subject us to business interruptions, litigation risks and reputational harm.
Our success depends significantly upon developing, maintaining and protecting our proprietary technology.
We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with employees, resellers, strategic partners and customers, to protect our proprietary rights.
We currently have multiple U.S. and international patent applications pending and multiple U.S. and international patents issued.
The pending applications may not be approved, and our existing and future patents may be challenged.
If such challenges are brought, the patents may be invalidated.
In addition, a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive condition.
Any such litigation may be time-consuming and costly.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
Such claims may be made against our products and services, our customers’ use of our products and services, or a combination of our products and third-party products.
We also may be subject to claims and indemnification obligations from customers and resellers with respect to third-party intellectual property rights pursuant to our agreements with them.
If we refuse to indemnify or defend such claims, even in situations in which the third-party’s allegations are meritless, then customers and resellers may refuse to do business with us.
Patent litigation is particularly common in our industry.
We have been, and continue to be, in active patent litigations with non-practicing entities.
We expect that companies in the network storage and data management markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps.
Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.
Many of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties.
Such third-party software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and software licensed under public open source licenses.
We have internal processes to manage our use of such third-party software.
In the case of open-source software licensed under certain “copyleft” licenses, the license itself may require, or a court-imposed remedy for non-compliant use of the open source

software may require, that proprietary portions of our own software be publicly disclosed or licensed.
We are exposed to the credit and non-payment risk of our customers, resellers and distributors, especially during times of economic uncertainty and tight credit markets, which could result in material losses.
Most of our sales to customers are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days.
We may experience losses due to a customer’s inability to pay.
Beyond our open credit arrangements, some of our customers have entered into recourse and non-recourse financing leasing arrangements using third-party leasing companies.
Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing companies in the event of end-user customer default.
During periods of economic uncertainty, our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases.
In addition, our exposure to credit risks of our customers may increase further if our customers and their customers or their lease financing sources are adversely affected by global economic conditions.
Our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters, terrorist acts or other catastrophic events.
We depend on the ability of our personnel, inventories, equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world.
Any political, military, terrorism, global trade, world health or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions.
Furthermore, any economic failure or other material disruption caused by natural disasters, including fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanoes; power loss or shortages; environmental disasters; telecommunications or business information systems failures or break-ins and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business.
Our headquarters is located in Northern California, an area susceptible to earthquakes and wildfires.
Our ability to pay quarterly dividends and to continue to execute our stock repurchase program as planned will be subject to, among other things, our financial condition and operating results, available cash and cash flows in the U.S., capital requirements, and other factors.
Future dividends are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors, and our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares.
Additionally, price volatility of our stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock’s market price at a given point in time.
