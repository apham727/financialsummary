Impact of New Lease Accounting Pronouncement 



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASC 842”), which requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than twelve months on its balance sheet.
We adopted the ASU in January of 2019, utilizing the effective date method of transition.
Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to our Financial Statements for further detail regarding the adoption of ASC 842.

Management Overview of Quarterly Results 



First Quarter Highlights.
Revenues.
Revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $244.8 million, a 21% increase when compared to revenues of $201.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the additional revenues generated from the acquisitions of Forte on October 1, 2018 and Business Ink on February 28, 2018, and the continued growth in our cloud solutions and managed service arrangements.
Operating income for the first quarter of 2019 was $32.1 million, or a 13.1% operating margin percentage, compared to $25.8 million, or a 12.8% operating margin percentage for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in operating income is primarily a result of the higher revenues generated in the first quarter of 2019, as reflected by our relatively consistent operating margin percentage.
Diluted EPS.
Diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2019 was $0.59 compared to $0.42 for the first quarter of 2018, reflective of the higher operating income for the first quarter of 2019.
Cash and Cash Flows.
As of March 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $141.9 million, as compared to $162.9 million as of December 31, 2018.
Our cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter of 2019 were $12.8 million.
See the Liquidity section below for further discussion of our cash flows.
Significant Client Relationships  



Client Concentration.
A large percentage of our historical revenues have been generated from our two largest clients, which are Comcast and Charter Corporation Inc. (“Charter”).
Comcast.
Comcast continues to be our largest client, generating 22% of our total revenues for the first quarter of 2019.
In November 2018, Comcast exercised the first of their two one-year renewal options extending the term of their agreement through June 30, 2020.
Terms of the extension remain consistent with the financial terms and obligations under the existing agreement.
Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, Comcast has the right to exercise an additional one-year renewal option no later than January 1, 2020, to extend the term of the Agreement through June 30, 2021.
We are currently engaged in discussions with Comcast regarding contract renewal terms.
Although we believe our operating relationship with Comcast is good, there can be no assurances around the timing and/or terms of any renewal arrangements at this time.
A copy of the Comcast agreement and related amendments, with confidential information redacted, is included in the exhibits to our periodic filings with the SEC.
Risk of Client Concentration.
Critical Accounting Policies  



The preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to select appropriate accounting policies, and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies.
Those critical accounting policies were determined by considering the accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments.
Total revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $244.8 million, a 21% increase when compared to $201.7 million for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in revenues can be mainly attributed to the following: (i) the additional revenues generated from the Forte acquisition on October 1, 2018; (ii) the additional revenues from the Business Ink acquisition on February 28, 2018 (as the first quarter of 2019 has a full quarter of revenues as compared to only one month of revenues for the first quarter of 2018); and (iii) continued growth in our cloud solutions and managed services arrangements.
The components of total revenues, discussed in more detail below, are as follows (in thousands):

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Cloud and Related Solutions Revenues.
Cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $219.6 million, a 24% increase when compared to $177.5 million for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in cloud and related solutions revenues between periods is primarily due to the additional revenues generated from the acquired Business Ink and Forte businesses, discussed above, and to a lesser degree, the execution of and performance under managed services and Ascendon arrangements.
Software and Services Revenues.
Software and services revenues for the first quarter of 2019 were $13.0 million, a 9% increase when compared to $12.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the timing of work performed and execution of software license agreements.
Maintenance Revenues.
Maintenance revenues were consistent between the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, coming in at $12.2 million for both periods.
Total Expenses.
Our operating expenses for the first quarter of 2019 were $212.7 million, a 21% increase when compared to $175.9 million for the first quarter of 2018.

The components of cost of revenues, discussed in more detail below, are as follows (in thousands): 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Cost of Cloud and Related Solutions (Exclusive of Depreciation).
The cost of cloud and related solutions for the first quarter of 2019 increased 32% to $114.7 million, from $86.9 million for the first quarter of 2018.
This increase can be mainly attributed to the cloud and related solutions expense of the acquired Business Ink and Forte businesses included in our results, to include acquisition amortization, and increased employee-related costs.
Total cloud and related solutions cost as a percentage of cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 were 52.2% and 49.0%, respectively (with the first quarter of 2019 reflective of the transaction fees of $17.1 million).

As a percentage of total revenues, R&D expense for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 were approximately 13.3% and 14.6%, respectively.
Our R&D efforts are focused on the continued evolution of our solutions that enable service providers worldwide to provide a more personalized customer experience while introducing new digital products and services.
Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expense.
SG&A expense for the first quarter of 2019 increased 13% to $45.9 million, from $40.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, with the increase primarily due to the SG&A costs related to Forte business.
Our SG&A costs as a percentage of total revenues for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 were approximately 18.8% and 20.2%, respectively, with the decrease reflective of the higher revenues for the period, mainly resulting from the Forte acquisition.
Depreciation.
Depreciation expense for the first quarter of 2019 increased 31% to $5.1 million, from $3.9 million for the first quarter of 2018.
Operating Income.
Operating income for the first quarter of 2019 was $32.1 million, or 13.1% of total revenues, compared to $25.8 million, or 12.8% of total revenues for the first quarter of 2018.
The increase in operating income is a result of the higher revenues generated in the first quarter of 2019, as reflected by our relatively consistent operating margin percentage.

20 



Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances as of the end of the indicated periods were located in the following geographical regions (in thousands):  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 We generally have ready access to substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances, but may face limitations on moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions due to currency controls.
As of March 31, 2019, we had $3.0 million of cash restricted as to use primarily to collateralize outstanding letters of credit.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities  



We calculate our cash flows from operating activities in accordance with U.S. GAAP, beginning with net income, adding back the impact of non-cash items or non-operating activity (e.g., depreciation, amortization, amortization of OID, impairments, gain/loss from debt extinguishments, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation, etc.
), and then factoring in the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities.
See our 2018 10-K for a description of the primary uses and sources of our cash flows from operating activities.
Our 2019 and 2018 net cash flows from operating activities, broken out between operations and changes in operating assets and liabilities, for the indicated quarterly periods are as follows (in thousands): 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 reflect the negative impacts of the payment of the 2018 and 2017 year-end accrued employee incentive compensation in the first quarter subsequent to the year-end accrual for these items.
Additionally, cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter of 2019 were negatively impacted by the timing around a certain recurring client payment at quarter-end.
This amount was subsequently collected in April 2019.
21 



Significant fluctuations in key operating assets and liabilities between 2019 and 2018 that impacted our cash flows from operating activities are as follows:  



Billed Trade Accounts Receivable 



Management of our billed accounts receivable is one of the primary factors in maintaining consistently strong quarterly cash flows from operating activities.
Our gross and net billed trade accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts receivable (“Allowance”) as of the end of the indicated quarterly periods, and the related DBOs for the quarters then ended, are as follows (in thousands, except DBOs):  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of March 31, 2019, approximately 95% of our billed accounts receivable balance is less than 60 days past due.
As a global provider of software and professional services, a portion of our accounts receivable balance relates to clients outside the U.S.
This diversity in the geographic composition of our client base may adversely impact our DBOs as longer billing cycles (i.e., billing terms and cash collection cycles) are an inherent characteristic of international software and professional services transactions.
For example, our ability to bill (i.e., send an invoice) and collect arrangement fees may be dependent upon, among other things: (i) the completion of various client administrative matters, local country billing protocols and processes (including local cultural differences), and/or non-client administrative matters; (ii) us meeting certain contractual invoicing milestones; or (iii) the overall project status in certain situations in which we act as a subcontractor to another vendor on a project.
Accrued Employee Compensation 



Accrued employee compensation decreased $9.6 million to $51.5 million as of March 31, 2019, from $61.1 million as of December 31, 2018, due primarily to the payment of the 2018 employee incentive compensation that was fully accrued at December 31, 2018, offset to a certain degree by the accrual for the 2019 employee incentive compensation.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities 



Our typical investing activities consist of purchases/sales of short-term investments and purchases of property and equipment, which are discussed below.
Additionally, during the first quarter of 2018 we acquired Business Ink for approximately $70 million ($68.6 million, net of cash acquired), and in the first quarter of 2019, as discussed in Note 2 to our Financial Statements, made an additional investment in a payment technology and services company for $4.0 million, which is included in our cash flows from investing activities.
Purchases/Sales of Short-term Investments.
For the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, we purchased $14.2 million and $15.1 million, respectively, and sold (or had mature) $19.6 million and $79.5 million, respectively, of short-term investments.
Software, Property and Equipment.
Our capital expenditures for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 for software, property and equipment were $8.3 million and $12.2 million, respectively, and consisted principally of investments in: (i) statement production equipment; (ii) computer hardware, software, and related equipment; and (iii) facilities and internal infrastructure items.
22 



Cash Flows from Financing Activities  



Our financing activities typically consist of activities associated with our common stock and our long-term debt.
Cash Dividends Paid on Common Stock.
During the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, the Board approved dividend payments totaling $7.4 million and $7.1 million, respectively, of which $7.6 million and $7.4 million, respectively, had been paid through March 31, 2019 and 2018 (with the differences attributed to unvested incentive shares that are paid upon vesting).
During the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 0.2 million and 0.1 million shares of our common stock, respectively, under the guidelines of our Stock Repurchase Program for $9.3 million and $5.7 million, respectively.
Long-term Debt.
During the first quarter of 2019, we made principal repayments of $1.9 million.
During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement and as a result, we repaid the outstanding principal balance of $120.0 million and borrowed $150.0 million under the 2018 Credit Agreement, resulting in a net increase of available cash of $30.0 million.
As part of the refinancing, we paid $1.4 million of deferred financing costs.
Capital Resources  



The following are the key items to consider in assessing our sources and uses of capital resources:  



Current Sources of Capital Resources.
•  



Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments.
As of March 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $141.9 million, of which approximately 62% is in U.S.
Dollars and held in the U.S. We have $3.0 million of restricted cash, used primarily to collateralize outstanding letters of credit.
For the remainder of the monies denominated in foreign currencies and/or located outside the U.S., we do not anticipate any material amounts being unavailable for use in running our business.
•  



Operating Cash Flows.
As described in the Liquidity section above, we believe we have the ability to generate strong cash flows to fund our operating activities and act as a source of funds for our capital resource needs.
•  



Revolving Credit Facility.
As of March 31, 2019, we had a $200 million revolving loan facility (2018 Revolver).
Uses/Potential Uses of Capital Resources.
Below are the key items to consider in assessing our uses/potential uses of capital resources:  



•  



Common Stock Repurchases.
As of March 31, 2019, we had 5.3 million shares authorized for repurchase remaining under our Stock Repurchase Program.
In September 2018, we announced an increase in our planned share repurchases of up to $150 million under our Stock Repurchase Program over the next three years.
Under our Stock Repurchase Program, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including through an accelerated stock repurchase plan or under a SEC Rule 10b5-1 plan.
Our common stock repurchases are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to our Financial Statements.
•  



Cash Dividends.
During the first quarter of 2019, the Board declared dividends totaling $7.4 million.
Going forward, we expect to pay cash dividends each year in March, June, September, and December, with the amount and timing subject to the Board’s approval.
•  



Acquisition.
On October 1, 2018, we acquired Forte, a leading provider of advanced payment solutions headquartered in Allen, Texas for a purchase price of approximately $93 million, (approximately $85 million, excluding cash acquired), and held back approximately $13 million in cash subject to certain tax filings.
The purchase agreement includes provisions for $18.8 million of potential future earn-out payments over a four-year measurement period.
The earn-out payments are tied to performance-based goals and continued employment by the eligible recipients.
•  



Equity Method Investment.
In the first quarter of 2019, we made an additional $4 million investment in a payment technology and services company that enables omni-channel digital payments in Latin America.
As of March 31, 2019, we held an 8% noncontrolling interest with a carrying value of $6.7 million.
•  



Capital Expenditures.
During the first quarter of 2019, we spent $8.3 million on capital expenditures.
As of March 31, 2019, we had committed to purchase approximately $6.5 million of equipment.
•  



Stock Warrants.
In 2014, we issued Stock Warrants with an exercise price of $26.68 per warrant to Comcast as an incentive for Comcast to convert new customer accounts to ACP.
Once vested, Comcast may exercise the Stock Warrants and elect either physical delivery of common shares or net share settlement (cashless exercise).
As of March 31, 2019, approximately 1.4 million Stock Warrants are outstanding, of which 0.4 million are vested.
The Stock Warrants are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to our Financial Statements.
•  



Long-Term Debt.
As of March 31, 2019, our long-term debt consisted of the following: (i) 2016 Convertible Notes with a par value of $230.0 million; and (ii) 2018 Credit Agreement term loan borrowings of $142.5 million.
2016 Convertible Notes 



During the next twelve months, there are no scheduled conversion triggers on our 2016 Convertible Notes.
As a result, we expect our required debt service cash outlay during the next twelve months for the 2016 Convertible Notes to be limited to interest payments of $9.8 million.
2018 Credit Agreement 



Our 2018 Credit Agreement mandatory repayments and the cash interest expense (based upon current interest rates) for the next twelve months is $7.5 million, and $6.3 million, respectively.
In summary, we expect to continue to have material needs for capital resources going forward, as noted above.
