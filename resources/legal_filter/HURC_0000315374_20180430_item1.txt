NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 



(Unaudited) 



 1.GENERAL 



The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Hurco Companies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We design, manufacture and sell computerized (i.e., Computer Numeric Control) machine tools, consisting primarily of vertical machining centers (mills) and turning centers (lathes), to companies in the metal cutting industry through a worldwide sales, service and distribution network.
Although the majority of our computer control systems and software products are proprietary, they predominantly use industry standard personal computer components.
Our computer control systems and software products are primarily sold as integral components of our computerized machine tool products.
We also provide machine tool components, software options, control upgrades, accessories and replacement parts for our products, as well as customer service and training support.
The condensed financial information as of April 30, 2018 and for the three and six months ended April 30, 2018 and April 30, 2017 is unaudited.
Currently, the only risk that we manage through the use of derivative instruments is foreign currency risk, for which we enter into derivative instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a major financial institution.
We enter into these forward exchange contracts to reduce the potential effects of foreign exchange rate movements on our net equity investment in one of our foreign subsidiaries, to reduce the impact on gross profit and net earnings from sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, and to reduce the impact on our net earnings of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies that are different than the subsidiaries’ functional currency.
We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in Euros, Pounds Sterling, Indian Rupee, South African Rand, Singapore Dollars, Chinese Yuan, Polish Zloty, and New Taiwan Dollars.
We record all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities at fair value.
Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments 



We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts periodically to hedge certain forecasted inter-company sales and purchases denominated in the following foreign currencies: the Pound Sterling, Euro and New Taiwan Dollar.
These forward contracts have been designated as cash flow hedge instruments and are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value in Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities.
8  



We had forward contracts outstanding as of April 30, 2018, denominated in Euros, Pounds Sterling and New Taiwan Dollars with set maturity dates ranging from May 2018 through April 2019.
The contract amounts, expressed at forward rates in U.S.
Dollars at April 30, 2018, were $41.0 million for Euros, $10.9 million for Pounds Sterling and $41.8 million for New Taiwan Dollars.
At April 30, 2018, we had approximately $1.4 million of losses, net of tax, related to cash flow hedges deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Included in this amount were $339,000 of unrealized losses, net of tax, related to cash flow hedge instruments that remain subject to currency fluctuation risk.
The majority of these deferred losses will be recorded as an adjustment to Cost of sales and service in periods through April 2019, when the corresponding inventory that is the subject of the related hedge contracts is sold, as described above.
To manage this risk, we entered into a forward contract with a notional amount of €3.0 million in November 2017.
We designated this forward contract as a hedge of our net investment in Euro denominated assets.
The forward method requires all changes in the fair value of the contract to be reported as a cumulative translation adjustment in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, in the same manner as the underlying hedged net assets.
This forward contract matures in November 2018.
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 



We also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies.
These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under the FASB guidance and, as a result, changes in their fair value are reported currently as Other expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income consistent with the transaction gain or loss on the related receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies.
We had forward contracts outstanding as of April 30, 2018, denominated in Euros, Pounds Sterling, South African Rand, and New Taiwan Dollar with set maturity dates ranging from May 2018 through October 2018.
The contract amounts, expressed at forward rates in U.S.
Dollars at April 30, 2018, totaled $58.1 million.
Fair Value of Derivative Instruments 



We recognize the fair value of derivative instruments as assets and liabilities on a gross basis on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We recognized a gain of $32,000 for the three months ended April 30, 2017 as a result of contracts closed early that were deemed ineffective for financial reporting purposes and did not qualify as cash flow hedges.
We recognized a gain of $168,000 for the six months ended April 30, 2017 as a result of contracts closed early that were deemed ineffective for financial reporting purposes and did not qualify as cash flow hedges.
The 2016 Equity Plan replaced the Hurco Companies, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2008 Plan”) and is the only active plan under which equity awards may be made by us to our employees and non-employee directors.
No further awards will be made under our 2008 Plan.
The total number of shares of our common stock that may be issued pursuant to awards under the 2016 Equity Plan is 856,048, which includes 386,048 shares remaining available for future grants under the 2008 Plan as of March 10, 2016, the date our shareholders approved the 2016 Equity Plan.
The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors has the authority to determine the officers, directors and key employees who will be granted awards under the 2016 Equity Plan; designate the number of shares subject to each award; determine the terms and conditions upon which awards will be granted; and prescribe the form and terms of award agreements.
No stock option may be exercised more than ten years after the date of grant or such shorter period as the Compensation Committee may determine at the date of grant.
A summary of stock option activity for the six-month period ended April 30, 2018, is as follows: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the six months ended April 30, 2018 was approximately $790,000.
Summarized information about outstanding stock options as of April 30, 2018, all of which are vested and currently exercisable, are as follows: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The intrinsic value of an outstanding stock option is calculated as the difference between the stock price as of April 30, 2018 and the exercise price of the option.

On November 15, 2017, the Compensation Committee granted a total of 2,364 shares of time-based restricted stock to our non-executive employees.
The restricted shares vest in thirds over three years from the date of grant provided the recipient remains employed through that date.
The grant date fair value of the restricted shares was based upon the closing sales price of our common stock on the date of grant, which was $42.30 per share.
On January 3, 2018, the Compensation Committee determined the degree to which the long-term incentive compensation arrangement approved for the fiscal 2015-2017 performance period was attained, and the resulting payout level relative to the target amount for each of the metrics that were established by the Compensation Committee in 2015.
The vesting date fair value of the performance shares was based on the closing sales price of our common stock on the vesting date, which was $42.20 per share.
On January 3, 2018, the Compensation Committee also approved a long-term incentive compensation arrangement for our executive officers in the form of restricted shares and performance stock units (“PSUs”) under the 2016 Equity Plan, which will be payable in shares of our common stock if earned and vested.
The awards were 25% time-based vesting and 75% performance-based vesting.
The three-year performance period for the PSUs is fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020.
On that date, the Compensation Committee granted a total of 14,810 shares of time-based restricted stock to our executive officers.
The restricted shares vest in thirds over three years from the date of grant provided the recipient remains employed through that date.
The grant date fair value of the restricted shares was based upon the closing sales price of our common stock on the date of grant, which was $42.20 per share.
On January 3, 2018, the Compensation Committee also granted a total target number of 20,734 PSUs to our executive officers designated as “PSU – TSR”.
These PSUs were weighted as approximately 40% of the overall 2018 executive long-term incentive compensation arrangement and will vest and be paid based upon the total shareholder return of our common stock over the three-year period of fiscal 2018-2020, relative to the total shareholder return of the companies in a specified peer group over that period.
Participants will have the ability to earn between 50% of the target number of the PSUs – TSR for achieving threshold performance and 200% of the target number of the PSUs – TSR for achieving maximum performance.
The grant date fair value of the PSUs – TSR was $45.68 per PSU and was calculated using the Monte Carlo approach.
On January 3, 2018, the Compensation Committee also granted a total target number of 21,891 PSUs to our executive officers designated as “PSU – ROIC”.
These PSUs were weighted as approximately 35% of the overall 2018 executive long-term incentive compensation arrangement and will vest and be paid based upon the achievement of pre-established goals related to our average return on invested capital over the three-year period of fiscal 2018-2020.
Participants will have the ability to earn between 50% of the target number of the PSUs - ROIC for achieving threshold performance and 200% of the target number of the PSUs - ROIC for achieving maximum performance.
The grant date fair value of the PSUs – ROIC was based on the closing sales price of our common stock on the grant date, which was $42.20 per share.
On March 15, 2018, the Compensation Committee granted a total of 9,114 shares of time-based restricted stock to our non-employee directors.
The restricted shares vest in full one year from the date of grant provided the recipient remains on the board of directors through that date.
The grant date fair value of the restricted shares was based on the closing sales price of our common stock on the grant date, which was $46.05 per share.
A reconciliation of the Company’s restricted stock, performance shares, PSUs activities and related information for the six-month period ended April 30, 2018 is as follows: 



 13  



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



During the first six months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, we recorded $1.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, as stock-based compensation expense related to grants under our equity plans.
As of April 30, 2018, there was an estimated $4.0 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost that we expect to recognize by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
4.EARNINGS PER SHARE 



Per share results have been computed based on the average number of common shares outstanding over the period in question.
The computation of basic and diluted net income per share is determined using net income applicable to common shareholders as the numerator and the number of shares outstanding as the denominator as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 5.ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 



Accounts receivable are net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $730,000 as of April 30, 2018 and $639,000 as of October 31, 2017.
6.INVENTORIES 



In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance on simplifying the measurement of inventory.
The guidance, which applies to inventory that is measured using any method other than the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) or retail inventory method, requires that entities measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
The Company adopted the provisions of this guidance prospectively in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
14  



Inventories, priced at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value, are summarized below (in thousands): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 7.SEGMENT INFORMATION  



We operate in a single segment: industrial automation equipment.
Our computer control systems and software products are primarily sold as integral components of our computerized machine tool products.
We also provide machine tool components, software options, control upgrades, accessories and replacement parts for our products, as well as customer service and training support.
8.GUARANTEES AND PRODUCT WARRANTIES  



From time to time, our subsidiaries guarantee third party payment obligations in connection with the sale of machines to customers that use financing.
We follow FASB guidance for accounting for guarantees (codified in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 460).
As of April 30, 2018, we had 27 outstanding third party payment guarantees totaling approximately $0.9 million.
The terms of these guarantees are consistent with the underlying customer financing terms.
Upon shipment of a machine, the customer assumes the risk of ownership.
The customer does not obtain title, however, until the customer has paid for the machine.
A retention of title clause allows us to recover the machine if the customer defaults on the financing.
We accrue liabilities under these guarantees at fair value, which amounts are insignificant.
We provide warranties on our products with respect to defects in material and workmanship.
The terms of these warranties are generally one year for machines and certain components and shorter periods for service parts.
We recognize a reserve with respect to this obligation at the time of product sale, with subsequent warranty claims recorded against the reserve.
15  



 9.DEBT AGREEMENTS  



On December 7, 2012, we entered into an agreement, which was subsequently amended on May 9, 2014, June 5, 2014, December 5, 2014 and December 6, 2016 (as amended, the “U.S.
credit agreement”) with a financial institution that provided us with an unsecured revolving credit and letter of credit facility.
The U.S. credit agreement permits us to pay certain cash dividends, so long as we are not in default under the U.S. credit agreement before and after giving effect to such dividends.
Borrowings under our U.S. credit agreement bear interest either at a LIBOR-based rate or a floating rate, in each case with an interest rate floor of 0.00%.
The floating rate equals the greatest of (a) a one month LIBOR-based rate plus 1.00% per annum, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% per annum, (c) the prevailing prime rate and (d) 0.00%.
The rate we must pay for that portion of the U.S. credit agreement which is not utilized is 0.05% per annum.
On December 6, 2016, we entered into a fourth amendment to our U.S. credit agreement to, among other things, increase the unsecured revolving credit facility from $12.5 million to $15.0 million, to increase the cash dividend allowance from $4.0 million per calendar year to $5.0 million per calendar year, and to extend the scheduled maturity date to December 31, 2018.
The U.S. credit agreement, as amended, provides for the issuance of up to $5.0 million in letters of credit.
We also amended the U.S. credit agreement to increase the minimum working capital and minimum tangible net worth requirements from $90.0 million to $105.0 million and $120.0 million to $125.0 million, respectively.
On February 16, 2017, we amended our credit facility in China to decrease the credit facility from 40.0 million Chinese Yuan to 20.0 million Chinese Yuan (approximately $3.2 million).
On February 14, 2018, we renewed this facility with an expiration date of February 13, 2019.
We had $1.6 million and $1.5 million of borrowings under our China credit facility at each of April 30, 2018 and October 31, 2017, respectively, which bears interest at variable rates of 4.7% and 4.4% annually, respectively.
We also have a £1.0 million revolving credit facility in the United Kingdom and a €1.5 million revolving credit facility in Germany.
We had no other debt or borrowings under any of our other credit facilities at either of those dates.
All of our credit facilities are unsecured.
At April 30, 2018, we had unutilized credit facilities of $19.8 million.
Our effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was 48% compared to 31% for the same period in fiscal 2017.
The effective tax rate for the six months ended April 30, 2018 is a blended rate reflecting the estimated benefit of approximately four months of the federal tax rate reductions for fiscal 2018, a one-time provisional charge of $2.5 million related to the transition tax on deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign income and a one-time non-cash tax charge of $0.4 million related to the revaluation of net deferred tax assets.
16  



The $2.5 million transition tax on deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign income is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment date, as provided by recent SEC guidance.
Any additional impacts from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act will be recorded as they are identified during the remainder of the measurement period as provided for in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118.
Our unrecognized tax benefits were $1.2 million as of April 30, 2018 and $1.1 million as of October 31, 2017, and in each case included accrued interest.
As of April 30, 2018, the gross amount of interest accrued, reported in Accrued expenses and other, was approximately $75,000, which did not include the federal tax benefit of interest deductions.
The statutes of limitations with respect to unrecognized tax benefits will expire between July 2018 and July 2020.
11.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  



FASB fair value guidance established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which categorizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exist, therefore, requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
In accordance with this guidance, the following table represents the fair value hierarchy for our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of April 30, 2018 and October 31, 2017 (in thousands): 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Included in Level 1 assets are mutual fund investments under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
We estimate the fair value of these investments on a recurring basis using market prices that are readily available.
Included in Level 2 fair value measurements are derivative assets and liabilities related to gains and losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts entered into with a third party.
We estimate the fair value of these derivatives on a recurring basis using foreign currency exchange rates obtained from active markets.
Derivative instruments are reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements at fair value.
We have derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts as described in Note 2 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The U.S. Dollar equivalent notional amounts of these contracts was $156.5 million and $134.3 million at April 30, 2018 and October 31, 2017, respectively.
17  



The fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the related currency positions are subject to offsetting market risk resulting from foreign currency exchange rate volatility.
The counterparty to the forward exchange contracts is a substantial and creditworthy financial institution.
We maintain insurance policies for such matters, and we record insurance recoveries when we determine such recovery to be probable.
13.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  



Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: 



In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and provide related footnote disclosures.
ASU No.
2014-15 is effective for our fiscal year 2018, including interim periods within the fiscal year.
As such, we adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
ASU 2015-11 is effective for our fiscal year 2018, with early adoption permitted and should be applied prospectively.
As such, we adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 on a prospective basis.
For additional information, see Note 6: Inventories.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.

18  



New Accounting Pronouncements: 



In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), establishing a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
This standard provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized.
The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
We have the option of applying this new standard retrospectively to each prior period presented (“full retrospective approach”) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized in retained earnings as of the date of adoption (“modified retrospective approach”).
Between August 2015 and December 2016, the FASB issued five additional updates to Topic 606: 1) ASU No.
2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date, 2) ASU No.
2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), 3) ASU No.

2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in each case to provide further guidance and clarification in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
Topic 606 and these updates will be effective for our fiscal year 2019, including interim periods within the fiscal year.
In connection with its adoption, we will compute required transition adjustments and expand our consolidated financial statement disclosures related to our implementation of this new accounting standard in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which establishes a comprehensive new lease accounting model.
ASU 2016-02 clarifies the definition of a lease, requires a dual approach to lease classification similar to current lease classifications, and requires lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use asset for leases with a lease-term of more than twelve months.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for our fiscal year 2020, including interim periods within the fiscal year, and requires modified retrospective application.
Early adoption is permitted.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which simplifies the application of hedge accounting and enables companies to better portray the economics of their risk management activities in their financial statements.
ASU 2017-12 is effective for our fiscal year 2020, including interim periods within the fiscal year, and requires modified retrospective application.
Early adoption is permitted.
In February 2018, FASB issued ASU No.
This standard also requires certain disclosures about stranded tax effects.

2018-03, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, that clarifies the guidance in ASU No.
2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10), which clarifies the guidance in ASU No.
2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10) on certain issues related to financial instruments including, among other things, forward contracts and presentation requirements.
ASU 2018-03 will be effective for our fiscal year 2019, including interim periods within the fiscal year.
