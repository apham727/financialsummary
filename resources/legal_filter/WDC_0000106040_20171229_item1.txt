Note 2.Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (“ASU 2016-15”).
ASU 2016-15 provides amendments that address eight specific cash flow classification issues for which there exists diversity in practice: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.
The Company adopted ASU 2016-15 in the second quarter of 2018 on a modified retrospective basis as required by the standard.
The Company’s adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-09, “Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”).
The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach.
This adoption resulted in a one-time net increase to beginning retained earnings of $70 million, consisting of a $58 million cumulative adjustment for the previously unrecognized windfall tax benefits related to previous vesting and exercises of stock-based awards, and a $19 million cumulative adjustment related to the change in accounting policy for estimated forfeitures and share cancellations, partially offset by a decrease of $7 million for the related tax impacts of change in forfeiture policy.
In addition, under the new standard, the Company will prospectively reflect the tax deficiencies and benefits as an operating activity, rather than as a financing activity under the previous standard, in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-07, “Investments- Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting” (“ASU 2016-07”).
ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment.
The Company adopted this standard in the second quarter of 2018.
The Company’s adoption of ASU 2016-07 did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015‑11, “Inventory (Topic 330) - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory” (“ASU 2015‑11”), which dictates that an entity should measure inventory within the scope of this update at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2018.
The Company’s adoption of ASU 2015‑11 did not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

 (Unaudited) 



The aggregate purchase price of acquisitions during the six months ended December 29, 2017 was $99 million in cash, with net assets acquired primarily consisting of developed technology and other intangibles assets, of which $61 million was allocated to goodwill.
Goodwill is primarily attributable to the benefits the Company expects to derive from diversifying product offerings to its Data Center Devices and Solutions and Client Solutions end markets as well as the acquired workforce.
Goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes because the acquisitions were structured as asset acquisitions but accounted for as business combinations.
Concurrent with these acquisitions, the Company received $36 million in proceeds on previously outstanding notes receivable due from these acquired entities.
During the six months ended December 29, 2017, the Company incurred $6 million of transaction expenses related to these acquisitions, which are primarily included within Selling, General and Administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Revenues and earnings related to these acquisitions was not material.
IPR&D is initially accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset.
During the three months ended December 29, 2017, two IPR&D projects reached technological feasibility totaling $616 million and commenced amortization over an estimated useful life of 4 years.

Note 8.Commitments, Contingencies and Related Parties



Flash Ventures



The Company’s business ventures with Toshiba Memory Corporation (“TMC”) consist of three separate legal entities: Flash Partners Ltd. (“Flash Partners”), Flash Alliance Ltd. (“Flash Alliance”), and Flash Forward Ltd. (“Flash Forward”), collectively referred to as “Flash Ventures”.
In connection with a settlement agreement with Toshiba, in December 2017, the Company entered into a facility agreement (“Y6 Facility Agreement”) with TMC related to the construction and operation of a new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Yokkaichi, Japan, referred to as “Fab 6”, which is primarily intended to provide cleanroom space to continue the transition of existing 2D NAND manufacturing capacity to BiCS 3D NAND manufacturing capacity.
See also Note 13, Legal Proceedings.
The following table presents the notes receivable from, and equity investments in, Flash Ventures as of December 29, 2017 and June 30, 2017:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



During the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, the Company made net payments to Flash Ventures of $1.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, for purchased flash-based memory wafers and net loans.
The Company aggregates its Flash Ventures’ notes receivable into one class of financing receivables due to the similar ownership interest and common structure in each Flash Venture entity.
For all reporting periods presented, no loans were past due and no loan impairments were recorded.
The Company’s notes receivable from each Flash Ventures entity, denominated in Japanese yen, are secured by equipment owned by that Flash Ventures entity.
The Company assesses financing receivable credit quality through financial and operational reviews of the borrower and creditworthiness, including credit rating agency ratings, of significant investors of the borrower, where material or known.
There were no such impairments in the three and six months ended December 29, 2017 and December 30, 2016.
As of December 29, 2017 and June 30, 2017, the Company had accounts payable balances due to Flash Ventures of $250 million and $206 million, respectively.

The Company’s maximum reasonably estimable loss exposure (excluding lost profits) as a result of its involvement with Flash Ventures, based upon the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate at December 29, 2017, is presented below.
Investments in Flash Ventures are denominated in Japanese yen and the maximum possible loss exposure excludes any cumulative translation adjustment due to revaluation from the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The Company is committed to purchase its provided three-month forecast of Flash Ventures’ NAND wafer supply, which generally equals 50% of Flash Ventures’ output.
The Company is not able to estimate its total wafer purchase commitment obligation beyond its rolling three-month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost of producing the semiconductor wafers.
In addition, the Company is committed to fund 49.9% to 50.0% of each Flash Ventures entity’s investments to the extent that each Flash Ventures entity’s operating cash flow is insufficient to fund these investments.
Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities



Flash Ventures sells and leases back from a consortium of financial institutions a portion of its tools and has entered into equipment lease agreements of which the Company guarantees half of the total outstanding obligations.
The lease agreements contain customary covenants for Japanese lease facilities.
In addition to containing customary events of default related to Flash Ventures that could result in an acceleration of Flash Ventures’ obligations, the lease agreements contain acceleration clauses for certain events of default related to the guarantors, including the Company.
The following table presents the Company’s portion of the remaining guarantee obligations under the Flash Ventures’ lease facilities in both Japanese yen and U.S. dollar-equivalent, based upon the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate as of December 29, 2017.

(1) Weighted average service period assumes the performance metrics are met for the PSUs.
Stock Repurchase Program



The Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) has authorized $5.00 billion for the repurchase of the Company’s common stock.
The stock repurchase program is effective until February 3, 2020.
The Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the three months ended December 29, 2017.
The remaining amount available to be purchased under the Company’s stock repurchase program as of December 29, 2017 was $2.10 billion.
Dividends to Shareholders



On September 13, 2012, the Company announced that the Board had authorized the adoption of a quarterly cash dividend policy.
Under the cash dividend policy, holders of the Company’s common stock receive dividends when and as declared by the Board.
The cash dividend aggregating $149 million was paid on January 16, 2018 to the Company’s shareholders of record as of December 29, 2017.
On January 27, 2018, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2018, which will be paid on April 16, 2018.
The Company may modify, suspend or cancel its cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time.
For the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, the Company has not finalized the accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Act.
Additional information regarding the significant provisions of the 2017 Act that are expected to impact the Company is provided below.
Re-measurement of deferred taxes



The provisional income tax benefit of $88 million recorded for the three and six months ended December 29, 2017 related to the re-measurement of the Company’s deferred tax balance is based on the rates at which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse in the current and future fiscal years, which are generally 29% and 22%, respectively.
As such, the provisional amount may change during the one-year measurement period when the Company finalizes the calculation of post-1986 foreign earnings and profits and the amount of foreign earnings held in cash or other specified assets.
This provision is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 which for the Company would be the fiscal year beginning on June 30, 2018 (fiscal year 2019).
Excluding these items, the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended December 29, 2017 would be approximately 4%.
The windfall tax benefits are a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which requires the Company to now recognize $5 million and $27 million of windfall tax benefits related to vesting and exercises of stock-based awards as a component of its income tax expense for the three and six months ended December 29, 2017, respectively.
The windfall tax benefits for the three and six months ended December 30, 2016 were recorded within stockholders’ equity.
The primary drivers for the difference between the effective tax rate for the six months ended December 30, 2016 and the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% are these discrete items, the current year generation of tax credits and tax holidays in Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand that expire at various dates during fiscal years 2018 through 2030.
During the six months ended December 29, 2017, the Company recorded a net increase of $7 million in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties).
As of December 29, 2017, the Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits (excluding accrued interest and penalties) was approximately $529 million.
Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 29, 2017 was approximately $94 million.
Meetings with the IRS Appeals Office began in March 2017.
The Company computes basic income (loss) per common share using net income (loss) and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted income (loss) per common share is computed using net income (loss) and the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.
Potentially dilutive common shares include dilutive outstanding employee stock options, RSUs and PSUs, and rights to purchase shares of common stock under the Company’s ESPP.

Toshiba Matters



In December 2017, the Company entered into a Confidential Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (the “Toshiba Settlement Agreement”) with Toshiba and TMC.
Under the Toshiba Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed to withdraw and seek dismissal of the litigation and arbitration proceedings discussed below.
Further information about the Toshiba Settlement Agreement is set forth below under “Settlement Agreement.”



Proceedings



In July 2017, the Company received a petition for provisional disposition that was filed by Toshiba and TMC in the Tokyo District Court.
The petition requested injunctive relief.
In August 2017, the Company received a complaint filed by Toshiba and TMC in the Tokyo District Court seeking a permanent injunction and damages of 120 billion Japanese yen.
The complaint was based on the same allegations as the petition for provisional disposition.
In May 2017, several of the Company’s SanDisk subsidiaries (the “SanDisk Subsidiaries”) filed a request for arbitration with the ICC International Court of Arbitration seeking an order requiring Toshiba to unwind the transfer of its interests in Flash Ventures to its affiliate, TMC, and injunctive relief preventing Toshiba from further breaching the Flash Ventures agreements in violation of the SanDisk Subsidiaries’ consent rights.
In June 2017, the SanDisk Subsidiaries sought preliminary injunctive relief in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Francisco in aid of that arbitration.
Among other things, SanDisk asked the Superior Court to prevent Toshiba from transferring its interests in Flash Ventures until the SanDisk Subsidiaries could seek injunctive relief in the arbitration to prevent a transfer.
SanDisk LLC also sought injunctive relief, a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order, in aid of that arbitration from the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Francisco.
In July 2017, SanDisk LLC amended its request for arbitration to, among other things, add TMC as a defendant.
In September 2017, the SanDisk Subsidiaries filed a request for arbitration with the ICC International Court of Arbitration against Toshiba in relation to Toshiba's announced decision to invest unilaterally in manufacturing equipment for the Fab 6 clean room at the joint venture operations in Yokkaichi, Japan.
The SanDisk Subsidiaries sought, among other things, a permanent injunction preventing Toshiba from making unilateral investments in capacity expansions and conversions for 3‑dimensional (“3D”) NAND technology, which we refer to as BiCS 3D NAND-flash memory, including investments in manufacturing equipment for Fab 6, without first complying with its obligations with respect to giving the SanDisk Subsidiaries the opportunity to make comparable investments.
Settlement Agreement



In December 2017, the Company, the SanDisk Subsidiaries, Toshiba and TMC entered into the Toshiba Settlement Agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to withdraw and seek dismissal of the proceedings above and mutually release each other from all claims relating to, among other things, (i) the transfer of Toshiba’s equity interests in Flash Ventures to TMC, (ii) the Access Restrictions, (iii) TMC’s decision to invest unilaterally in Phase I of Fab 6 and (iv) the sale of TMC to K.K.
Pangea (“Pangea”), which will be owned, as of the closing of the sale, by certain members of a consortium of investors led by Bain Capital (as defined below).
In addition, the Company agreed to consent to the transfer of Toshiba’s interests in Flash Ventures to TMC, the assignment of all agreements relating to Flash Ventures by Toshiba to TMC and the sale of TMC to Pangea.
Toshiba and TMC have also agreed to end the Access Restrictions.
Pursuant to the Toshiba Settlement Agreement, the Company and the SanDisk Subsidiaries also entered into certain other agreements with TMC related to the operation of Flash Ventures, including an agreement regarding the construction and operation of Fab 6 and the extension of the term of Flash Alliance.
In December 2017, the Company and the SanDisk Subsidiaries also entered into a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release with Bain Capital Private Equity, L.P., BCPE Pangea Cayman, L.P., BCPE Pangea Cayman2, Ltd., Bain Capital Fund XII, L.P., Bain Capital Asia Fund III, L.P. and Pangea (together, “Bain Capital”) on terms substantially similar to the terms of the Toshiba Settlement Agreement, subject to certain transfer restrictions on Bain Capital.

Copyright



In December 2011, the German Central Organization for Private Copying Rights (Zentralstelle für private Überspielungsrechte) (“ZPÜ”), an organization consisting of several copyright collecting societies, instituted arbitration proceedings against WD’s German subsidiary (“WD Germany”) before the Copyright Arbitration Board (“CAB”) claiming copyright levies for multimedia hard drives, external hard drives and network hard drives sold or introduced into commerce in Germany by WD Germany from January 2008 through December 2010.
In February 2013, WD Germany filed a declaratory relief action against ZPÜ in the Higher Regional Court of Munich (the “Higher Court”), seeking an order from the Higher Court to determine the copyright levy issue.
In May 2013, ZPÜ filed a counter-claim against WD Germany with the Higher Court, seeking copyright levies for multimedia hard drives, external hard drives and network hard drives sold or introduced into commerce from January 2008 through December 2010 based on tariffs published by ZPÜ in November 2011.
In January 2015, the Higher Court ruled in favor of ZPÜ.
In its ruling, the Higher Court declared that WD Germany must pay certain levies on certain products which it sold in Germany between January 2008 and December 2010.
The judgment specified levy amounts on certain products sold from January 2008 through December 2010 and directed WD Germany to disclose applicable sales data to ZPÜ.
The exact amount of the judgment had not been determined.
ZPÜ and WD Germany filed appeals with the German Federal Court of Justice in February 2015.
In March 2017, the German Federal Court of Justice rendered a judgment affirming ZPÜ’s claim concerning the disclosure of WD Germany’s sales data regarding HDDs sold between January 2008 and December 2010.
The German Federal Court of Justice also set aside the Higher Court’s decision on the levy amounts and referred the case back to the Higher Court for further fact finding and decision on the levy amounts.
The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.
In December 2014, ZPÜ submitted a pleading to the CAB seeking copyright levies for multimedia hard drives, external hard drives and network hard drives sold or introduced into commerce in Germany by WD Germany between January 2012 and December 2013.
The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter.
