ITEM 2.  
We are a leading provider of advanced communications solutions for both commercial and government customers worldwide. Our solutions fulfill our customers’ needs for secure wireless communications in some of the most demanding environments, including those where traditional communications are unavailable or cost-prohibitive, and in mission-critical and other scenarios where performance is crucial. 
•Commercial Solutions - serves commercial customers and smaller government customers, such as state and local governments, that require advanced communication technologies to meet their needs. This segment also serves certain large government customers (including the U.S. government) that have requirements for off-the-shelf commercial equipment. We believe this segment is a leading provider of satellite communications (such as satellite earth station modems and traveling wave tube amplifiers ("TWTA")), public safety systems (such as next generation 911 ("NG911") technologies) and enterprise application technologies (such as messaging and trusted location-based technologies). 
•Government Solutions - serves large government end-users (including those of foreign countries) that require mission critical technologies and systems. We believe this segment is a leading provider of command and control applications (such as the design, installation and operation of data networks that integrate computing and communications (including both satellite and terrestrial links)), ongoing network operation and management support services (including telecom expense management, project management and fielding and maintenance solutions related to satellite ground terminals), troposcatter communications (such as digital troposcatter multiplexers, digital over-the-horizon modems, troposcatter systems, and frequency converter systems) and RF power and switching technologies (such as solid state high-power broadband amplifiers, enhanced position location reporting system (commonly known as "EPLRS") amplifier assemblies, identification friend or foe amplifiers, and amplifiers used in the counteraction of improvised explosive devices).
We consider certain accounting policies to be critical due to the estimation process involved in each.
Revenue Recognition. We earn revenue from the sale of advanced communication solutions to customers around the world. Sales of advanced communication solutions can consist of any one or a combination of items required by our customer including hardware, technology platforms and related support. A large portion of our revenue from advanced communication solutions is derived from contracts relating to the design, development or manufacture of complex electronic equipment to a buyer’s specification or to provide services relating to the performance of such contracts and is recognized in accordance with FASB ASC 605-35. For these contracts, we primarily apply the percentage-of-completion accounting method and generally recognize revenue based on the relationship of total costs incurred to total projected costs, or, alternatively, based on output measures, such as units delivered or produced. Profits expected to be realized on such contracts are based on total estimated sales for the contract compared to total estimated costs, including warranty costs, at completion of the contract.
We also derive a portion of our revenues for advanced communication solutions from contracts and purchase orders where revenue is recorded on delivery of products or performance of services. Such revenues are recognized in accordance with the authoritative guidance contained in FASB ASC 605-25 "Revenue Recognition - Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements" ("FASB ASC 605-25") and, as applicable, FASB ASC 605-20 "Revenue Recognition - Services" ("FASB ASC 605-20") and Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2009-14 (FASB ASC Topic 985) "Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements." Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements. In summary, we recognize revenue for each separate unit of accounting when the applicable revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met. We allocate revenue to each separate unit of accounting in a multi-element arrangement based on the relative fair value of each element, using vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of their fair values, if available. VSOE is generally determined based on the price charged when an element is sold separately. In the absence of VSOE of fair value, the fee is allocated among each element based on third-party evidence ("TPE") of fair value, which is determined based on competitor pricing for similar deliverables when sold separately. When we are unable to establish fair value using VSOE or TPE, we use estimated selling price ("ESP") to allocate value to each element. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold separately. We determine ESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices we charge for similar offerings, market conditions, competitive landscape, and pricing practices. For multiple element arrangements that contain only software and software-related elements, we allocate the fees to each element based on the VSOE of fair value of each element. Due to the nature of some of the agreements it may be difficult to establish VSOE of separate elements of an agreement; in these circumstances the appropriate recognition of revenue may require the use of judgment based on the particular facts and circumstances.
In accordance with FASB ASC 350 "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other," we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods. If we fail the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment ("quantitative assessment"), pursuant to our adoption of FASB ASU No. 2017-04 in fiscal 2017, we would be required to recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value; however, any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
In performing the quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approaches. The income approach, also known as the discounted cash flow ("DCF") method, utilizes the present value of cash flows to estimate fair value. The future cash flows for our reporting units were projected based on our estimates, at that time, of future revenues, operating income and other factors (such as working capital and capital expenditures). For purposes of conducting our impairment analysis, we assumed revenue growth rates and cash flow projections that are below our actual long-term expectations. The discount rates used in our DCF method were based on a weighted-average cost of capital ("WACC") determined from relevant market comparisons, adjusted upward for specific reporting unit risks (primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows). A terminal value growth rate was applied to the final year of the projected period and reflected our estimate of stable, perpetual growth. We then calculated a present value of the respective cash flows for each reporting unit to arrive at an estimate of fair value under the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimated a fair value based on comparable companies' market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and factored in a control premium. Finally, we compared our estimates of fair values to our August 1, 2017 total public market capitalization and assessed implied control premiums based on our common stock price of $18.47 as of August 1, 2017. 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness, as determined by our review of our customers’ current credit information. Generally, we will require cash in advance or payment secured by irrevocable letters of credit before an order is accepted from an international customer that we do not do business with regularly. In addition, we seek to obtain insurance for certain domestic and international customers.
We monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. In light of ongoing tight credit market conditions, we continue to see requests from our customers for higher credit limits and longer payment terms. Because of our strong cash position and the nominal amount of interest we are earning on our cash and cash equivalents, we have, on a limited basis, approved certain customer requests.
•Net sales of $147.9 million;
•Operating income of $14.0 million; 
•Net income of $8.2 million;
•Adjusted EBITDA (a Non-GAAP financial measure discussed below) of $23.5 million.
During the three months ended April 30, 2018, our Commercial Solutions segment received a large strategic multi-year contract award from the U.S. Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command in the amount of $59.0 million to purchase our SLM-5650B satellite modems, upgrade kits and related services. We have received initial funding of approximately $8.2 million and given the U.S. Navy's pressing operational needs, we shipped most of these orders during our third quarter, which positively impacted our operating income. We originally expected to begin shipments of this satellite earth station equipment during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Although timing for U.S. government orders are generally difficult to predict, we are optimistic that we will receive and ship additional orders for this equipment during the remainder of fiscal 2018. In addition to strong demand from our U.S. Navy customer, we continue to see signs that our HeightsTM Dynamic Network Access Technology ("HEIGHTS" or "HDNA") solutions are gaining traction. During the third quarter, Orange Business Services, one of the largest telecommunications operations and IT services company in the world, selected HEIGHTS to support relief projects in two African countries. This award is a testament to our HEIGHTS products and bodes well for future orders from this and other similar customers. Our Commercial Solutions segment was awarded a $10.1 million multi-year contract to provide one of the largest wireless carriers in the U.S. with a hosted, advanced location services platform. During our third quarter, we were also awarded a two-year multi-million dollar contract to provide Next Generation ("NG") Text to 911 emergency services for the state of Maryland. Through this contract award, 911 call centers located across the state of Maryland will be outfitted to receive and respond to text messages sent to 911.
Given our expectations for the fourth quarter, we expect fiscal 2018 to be a year of net sales and Adjusted EBITDA growth. Excluding a number of favorable adjustments throughout fiscal 2017, which aggregated $18.8 million and which are more fully discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC, fiscal 2018 is also expected to be a year of operating income growth.
•an annual net sales growth rate of close to 5.0% as compared to fiscal 2017;
•consolidated operating income, as a percentage of net sales, of approximately 5.2% which compares favorably with the 3.3% of consolidated net sales we achieved in fiscal 2017 (excluding the $18.8 million of favorable adjustments that are more fully discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC); 
•Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, of close to 13.0%. 
From a timing perspective, our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 is still expected to be the peak quarter for both consolidated net sales and Adjusted EBITDA but our third quarter of fiscal 2018 is now expected to be the peak quarter of consolidated operating income. As discussed above, our operating income for the third quarter reflects the benefit of shipments of satellite earth station equipment to the U.S. Navy that were previously expected to occur in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Our fourth quarter net sales assumptions now reflect this and other changes in product mix (including lower expected sales of higher margin cyber training software solutions). As we did last year, we intend to pay certain fiscal 2018 non-equity incentive awards in the form of fully vested share units which will result in an increase in amortization of stock-based compensation in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. This amortization expense is included in the calculation of operating income but is excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA financial measure. Based on the type of awards currently outstanding and awards expected to be issued during the remainder of fiscal 2018, total amortization of stock-based compensation is expected to be higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017. If order flow remains strong and we are able to achieve all of our fiscal 2018 business goals, it is possible that our fiscal 2018 net sales and Adjusted EBITDA growth rates could be higher than our targeted amounts. We expect our GAAP net income to be higher in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to the benefits associated with H.R.1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform") which was enacted on December 22, 2017.
On June 6, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable on August 17, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 16, 2018. Future dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, as well as Board approval. 
Net Sales. Consolidated net sales were $147.9 million and $127.8 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of $20.1 million, or 15.7%. The period-over-period increase in net sales was due primarily to higher net sales in both our Commercial Solutions segment and Government Solutions segment. Net sales by operating segment are discussed below. 
Net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment were $89.9 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018, as compared to $79.4 million for the three months ended April 30, 2017, an increase of $10.5 million, or 13.2%. Our Commercial Solutions segment represented 60.8% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018 as compared to 62.1% for the three months ended April 30, 2017. 
Bookings during the three months ended April 30, 2018 were solid. Although bookings were lower than the amount we achieved during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, bookings increased as compared to the three months ended April 30, 2017. Our second quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected the benefit of a large multi-year strategic contract valued at $134.0 million to provide one of the largest wireless carriers in the U.S. with enhanced 911 ("E911") services. Our book-to-bill ratio (a measure defined as bookings divided by net sales) for the three months ended April 30, 2018 was 0.93. As further discussed below, we have a growing pipeline of opportunities and expect that the book-to-bill ratio in this segment will exceed 1.00 for fiscal 2018. We continue to see strong demand in almost all of our Commercial Solutions product lines, which are further discussed below. 
Net sales of our satellite earth station products in fiscal 2018 also reflect the benefit of orders received for our HeightsTM Dynamic Network Access Technology ("HEIGHTS" or "HDNA") solutions. We continue to see signs that our HEIGHTS solutions are gaining traction. We believe HEIGHTS is a revolutionary technology that is designed to deliver the highest Internet Protocol bits per Hertz in its class, as well as robust reliability. HEIGHTS has been and will continue to be a cornerstone of our future research and development efforts. Although the sales cycle for this product line is longer than our historical satellite earth station product line sales cycle, to-date, we have announced several important customer wins for this product line and our pipeline of opportunities continues to grow. For example, during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced that Orange Business Services, one of the largest telecommunications operations and IT services companies in the world, selected HEIGHTS to help them support relief projects in two African countries. We believe this order bodes well for the future given the purchasing influence that Orange Business Services has in other countries. 
Net sales during the three months ended April 30, 2018 of both enterprise technology solutions (such as our location and messaging platforms) and safety and security technology solutions (such as our wireless and next generation 911 ("NG911") platforms) were higher as compared to the net sales we achieved during the three months ended April 30, 2017. During our third quarter of fiscal 2018, we were awarded a $10.1 million multi-year contract to provide one of the largest wireless carriers in the U.S. with a hosted, advanced location services platform which leverages our Position Determining Engine ("PDE"). Under this competitively awarded contract, the U.S. wireless carrier is expected to migrate existing location services from a competitive solution to our more advanced, secure and reliable technologies. Also, we were awarded a two-year multi-million dollar contract to provide Next Generation ("NG") Text to 911 emergency services for the state of Maryland. Through this contract award, 911 call centers located across the state of Maryland will be outfitted to receive and respond to text messages sent to 911. In our view, these contract awards validate that our enterprise technology solutions and safety and security technology solutions are more advanced, secure and reliable than any existing competitive technology. Market conditions remain favorable and we expect that aggregate net sales of these solutions in fiscal 2018 will be higher than in fiscal 2017.
Net sales in our Government Solutions segment were $57.9 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018 as compared to $48.4 million for the three months ended April 30, 2017, an increase of $9.5 million, or 19.6%. Our Government Solutions segment represented 39.2% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018, as compared to 37.9% for the three months ended April 30, 2017. 
Net sales of our command and control solutions (which include the design, installation and operation of secure wireless communication networks, cyber intelligence solutions and blue-force tracking solutions) during the three months ended April 30, 2018 were significantly higher than the three months ended April 30, 2017. Our most recent quarter benefited from sales to a major U.S. space contractor to source and test space level Electrical, Electronic and Electromechanical ("EEE") parts in support of critical NASA programs and from an international space agency for the design, development and installation of multiple launch vehicle tracking stations in the South Pacific. We continue to work with the U.S. Army on our recently awarded $11.7 million order to provide several thousand of our next generation MT-2025 mobile satellite transceivers to support the U.S. Army's BFT-2 system. The BFT-2 system, which is part of the U.S. Army's JBC-P program, provides global real-time situational awareness and networking capabilities for U.S. warfighters and is the successor to the BFT-1 system. We expect initial shipments of MT-2025 transceivers to start during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and additional orders for our MT-2025 transceivers are ultimately expected.
Although net sales of our over-the-horizon microwave systems products this quarter were lower than the comparative quarter ended April 30, 2017, business activity in our over-the-horizon microwave systems product line continues to pick-up. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we shipped certain troposcatter equipment to support U.S. Army activities throughout the Korean Peninsula. We believe demand for our over-the-horizon microwave systems will increase and have recently submitted a proposal to supply a significant quantity of our over-the-horizon microwave systems to the U.S. Army. We teamed with a large prime contractor and we are hopeful that we can win this multi-million dollar award in fiscal 2019.
Sales to U.S. government customers include sales to the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as sales directly to or through prime contractors. 
Domestic sales include sales to commercial customers, as well as to U.S. state and local governments. Included in domestic sales, are sales to Verizon Communications Inc. ("Verizon"), which represented 9.8% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018. Sales to Verizon were less than 10.0% of consolidated net sales for the comparable prior year period. 
International sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $36.3 million and $34.1 million, respectively. Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10.0% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017. 
Gross Profit. Gross profit was $62.4 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018 as compared to $52.5 million for the three months ended April 30, 2017, an increase of $9.9 million. This increase in gross profit dollars was largely driven by higher net sales in both our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions segments, offset in part by the absence of $1.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, was 42.2% for the three months ended April 30, 2018 as compared to 41.1% for the three months ended April 30, 2017. Gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, is further discussed below.
Our Commercial Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the three months ended April 30, 2018 was higher than the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher net sales and overall favorable product mix changes (including earlier than expected shipments of satellite earth station equipment to the U.S. Navy) during the most recent fiscal quarter. Given timing and other product mix changes, gross profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 in this segment is expected to decline from the level achieved in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Overall, we expect gross profit in this segment, as a percentage of related fiscal 2018 net sales, to be comparable to the percentage achieved in fiscal 2017.
Our Government Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the three months ended April 30, 2018 was slightly lower when compared to the prior year period, but an improvement over the first two quarters of fiscal 2018. Our third quarter of fiscal 2018 reflects the absence of $1.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees that benefited the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2017, as discussed above. Although we expect net sales in the fourth quarter in this segment to increase as compared to our most recent quarter, we have updated our product mix assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2018 which now reflect lower expected sales of higher margin cyber training software solutions, offset by other anticipated command and control solution sales. Sales cycles for cyber training software solutions are generally long and timing of related awards is difficult to predict. As a result of our updated product mix assumptions, we believe that gross profit (both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales in this segment) will be lower in the fourth quarter as compared to our third quarter of fiscal 2018. Overall, given the absence of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees in fiscal 2018, we expect gross profit in this segment, both in dollars and as a percentage of related net sales, to be lower than the respective metrics achieved in fiscal 2017. However, over time, we believe the implementation of our strategy of shifting our Government Solutions segment away from bidding on large commodity service contracts and toward pursuing contracts for our niche solutions will result in higher gross margins in this segment.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $30.4 million and $25.9 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of $4.5 million. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 20.6% and 20.3% for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in spending, both in dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net sales, is primarily attributable to the recovery of certain legal expenses from a third party during the three months ended April 30, 2017. Our results for the most recent quarter reflect the benefits of prior cost reduction actions. We continue to evaluate and implement cost reduction initiatives to reduce unnecessary spending, reduce the size and cost of our facilities and improve our productivity. Our Business Outlook for Fiscal 2018 does not consider the financial impact of any actions we may take.
Amortization of stock-based compensation expense recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses was $1.0 million and $0.9 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2018 selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be comparable to fiscal 2017. 
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $12.8 million and $13.0 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing a decrease of $0.2 million, or 1.5%. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 8.7% and 10.2% for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, was due primarily to the higher net sales during the most recent fiscal quarter, as discussed above. 
For the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, research and development expenses of $11.3 million and $10.7 million, respectively, related to our Commercial Solutions segment and $1.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively, related to our Government Solutions segment. The remaining research and development expenses of $0.1 million for both the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the amortization of stock-based compensation expense. 
We continue to invest in enhancements to existing products as well as in new products across almost all of our product lines. Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2018 research and development expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be comparable to fiscal 2017.
Amortization of Intangibles. Amortization relating to intangible assets with finite lives was $5.3 million (of which $4.4 million was for the Commercial Solutions segment and $0.8 million was for the Government Solutions segment) for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and $5.5 million (of which $4.4 million was for the Commercial Solutions segment and $1.0 million was for the Government Solutions segment) for the three months ended April 30, 2017. The decrease is a result of certain intangibles that became fully amortized in fiscal 2017. As such, we anticipate amortization of intangibles in fiscal 2018 to be lower than in fiscal 2017.
Settlement of Intellectual Property Litigation. During the three months ended April 30, 2017, we recorded a favorable adjustment to operating income of $2.0 million, net of estimated legal fees, to reflect a lower loss than originally estimated for a TCS intellectual property matter which was settled during that period. There was no comparable adjustment in the three months ended April 30, 2018.
The increase during the most recent fiscal quarter in our Commercial Solutions segment’s operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to higher net sales, overall favorable product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above. Given earlier than expected shipments of satellite earth station equipment to the U.S. Navy, our third quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be the peak quarter of operating income for this segment. Overall, we expect fiscal 2018 operating income in our Commercial Solutions segment, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to increase as compared to fiscal 2017.
The increase during the most recent fiscal quarter in our Government Solutions segment's operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to higher net sales, overall product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, offset in part by the absence of $1.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above. Based on the strength of our third quarter performance, an assessment of timing associated with our current backlog and updated product mix assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2018 (including lower expected sales of higher margin cyber training software solutions), we expect this segment's operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to be comparable to the amount we achieved during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Overall, operating income for this segment, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, is expected to be higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017.
Unallocated operating expenses for the three months ended April 30, 2018 were $5.4 million as compared to operating income of $0.2 million for the three months ended April 30, 2017 (which includes a favorable adjustment of $2.0 million, as discussed above). Excluding the $2.0 million adjustment, unallocated operating expenses would have been $1.8 million for the three months ended April 30, 2017. The increase to $5.4 million from $1.8 million is primarily attributable to the recovery of certain legal expenses from a third party during the three months ended April 30, 2017. Unallocated operating expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter includes the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated.
Unallocated operating expenses for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 include amortization of stock-based compensation of $1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Amortization of stock-based compensation expense can fluctuate from period-to-period based on the type and timing of stock-based awards. Given the timing of anticipated fiscal 2018 awards, amortization of stock-based compensation is expected to be significantly higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to our most recent quarter. Based on the type of awards currently outstanding and awards expected to be issued during the remainder of fiscal 2018, amortization of stock-based compensation is also expected to be higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017.
Looking forward, we expect our unallocated operating expenses in fiscal 2018 to significantly increase as compared to the $5.6 million of unallocated operating expenses for fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2017, unallocated operating expenses were offset by a number of favorable adjustments throughout the fiscal year, which aggregated $18.8 million and which are more fully discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC. Excluding the $18.8 million of favorable adjustments, unallocated operating expenses in fiscal 2017 would have been $24.4 million. Given the success of our cost reduction actions taken to date and current spending plans, we expect our unallocated operating expenses in fiscal 2018 to be lower than the $24.4 million of unallocated operating expenses incurred in fiscal 2017, prior to the favorable adjustments discussed above.
On a consolidated basis, we are targeting to achieve operating income, as a percentage of net sales, of approximately 5.2% in fiscal 2018, which compares favorably with the 3.3% of consolidated net sales we achieved in fiscal 2017 (excluding the $18.8 million of favorable adjustments to operating income discussed above). Based on the strength of our third quarter performance, an assessment of timing associated with our current backlog and updated product mix assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we now expect consolidated operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to be the peak quarter for the fiscal year.
Interest Expense. Interest expense was $2.5 million and $2.8 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decline in interest expense primarily reflects lower total indebtedness, which declined from $235.4 million as of April 30, 2017 to $186.4 million as of April 30, 2018. Interest expense for both periods primarily reflects interest on our Secured Credit Facility, as amended. Based on the type, terms, amount of outstanding debt (including capital leases and other obligations) and current interest rates, we estimate that our effective interest rate (including amortization of deferred financing costs) will approximate 5.4% in fiscal 2018. Our actual cash borrowing rate (which excludes the amortization of deferred financing costs) currently approximates 4.3%.
Interest (Income) and Other. Interest (income) and other for both the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 was nominal. All of our available cash and cash equivalents are currently invested in bank deposits and money market deposit accounts which, at this time, are currently yielding a blended annual interest rate of approximately 0.64%.
Provision For Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes was $3.1 million and $2.9 million for the three months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 27.2% for the three months ended April 30, 2018, as compared to 39.5% for the three months ended April 30, 2017. 
During the three months ended April 30, 2018, we recorded a net discrete tax expense of less than $0.1 million. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended April 30, 2017 reflects a net discrete tax expense of $0.3 million. Excluding discrete tax items for the three months ended April 30, 2018, our estimated effective tax rate would have been 27.0%. Our effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax items, for the three months ended April 30, 2017 was 36.0%. The decrease from 36.0% to 27.0% is principally attributable to the passage of Tax Reform which reduced the statutory income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, or a blended income tax rate of approximately 27.0%.
Net Income. During the three months ended April 30, 2018, consolidated net income was $8.2 million as compared to $4.4 million during the three months ended April 30, 2017. 
The increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA during the three months ended April 30, 2018 as compared to the three months ended April 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to higher net sales and overall favorable product mix changes, offset in part by higher operating expenses during the three months ended April 30, 2018 as a result of the increased sales activity during the period. Also, selling, general and administrative expenses during the three months ended April 30, 2017 included a recovery of certain legal expenses from a third party, as discussed above.
The increase in our Commercial Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, during the most recent fiscal quarter was primarily due to higher net sales, overall favorable product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
The increase in our Government Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, during the most recent fiscal quarter was primarily due to higher net sales, overall product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, offset in part by an absence of $1.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above. As a result of the aforementioned change in product mix assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2018, our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA in this segment is expected to be lower than the amount we reported in our most recent period.
Looking forward, we anticipate consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to increase in the fourth quarter as compared to the amount we achieved in the third quarter. 
Given our year-to-date performance, we are targeting fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA to grow close to 6.0% over the $70.7 million we achieved in fiscal 2017. In addition, despite the absence of $6.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees (which the U.S. Army is no longer obligated to pay us to support the BFT-1 system), we expect Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of fiscal 2018 consolidated net sales, to be close to 13.0%, which is slightly higher than the 12.8% we achieved in fiscal 2017. We believe these targeted financial metrics demonstrate the strength of our business. If order flow remains strong and we are able to achieve all of our fiscal 2018 business goals, it is possible that our fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA financial metrics could be higher than our targeted amounts. 
Net Sales. Consolidated net sales were $403.2 million and $402.6 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing an increase of $0.6 million, or 0.1%. The period-over-period increase in net sales was due primarily to higher net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment offset by lower net sales in our Government Solutions segment. Net sales by operating segment are discussed below. 
Net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment were $251.9 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2018, as compared to $237.7 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2017, an increase of $14.2 million, or 6.0%. Our Commercial Solutions segment represented 62.5% of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 as compared to 59.0% for the nine months ended April 30, 2017. 
Bookings during the nine month period in fiscal 2018 were strong and reflect strength in almost all of our Commercial Solutions product lines. Our book-to-bill ratio (a measure defined as bookings divided by net sales) for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 was 1.40. As further discussed below, we have a growing pipeline of opportunities and expect that the book-to-bill ratio in this segment will exceed 1.00 for fiscal 2018. 
Net sales of our satellite earth station products in fiscal 2018 also reflect the benefit of orders received for our HeightsTM Dynamic Network Access Technology ("HEIGHTS" or "HDNA") solutions. We continue to see signs that our HEIGHTS solutions are gaining traction. We believe HEIGHTS is a revolutionary technology that is designed to deliver the highest Internet Protocol bits per Hertz in its class, as well as robust reliability. HEIGHTS has been and will continue to be a cornerstone of our future research and development efforts. Although the sales cycle for this product line is longer than our historical satellite earth station product line sales cycle, to-date, we have announced several important customer wins for this product line and our pipeline of opportunities continues to grow. For example, during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced that Orange Business Services, one of the largest telecommunications operations and IT services companies in the world, selected HEIGHTS to help them support relief projects in two African countries. We believe this order bodes well for the future given the purchasing influence that Orange Business Services has in other countries. 
Net sales in our Government Solutions segment were $151.3 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 as compared to $164.9 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2017, a decrease of $13.6 million, or 8.2%. Our Government Solutions segment represented 37.5% of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2018, as compared to 41.0% for the nine months ended April 30, 2017. 
Net sales of our command and control solutions (which include the design, installation and operation of secure wireless communication networks, cyber intelligence solutions and blue-force tracking solutions) during the nine months ended April 30, 2018 were higher than the nine months ended April 30, 2017. Our most recent nine month period benefited from sales to a major U.S. space contractor to source and test space level Electrical, Electronic and Electromechanical ("EEE") parts in support of critical NASA programs and from an international space agency for the design, development and installation of multiple launch vehicle tracking stations in the South Pacific. We continue to work with the U.S. Army on our recently awarded $11.7 million order to provide several thousand of our next generation MT-2025 mobile satellite transceivers to support the U.S. Army's BFT-2 system. The BFT-2 system, which is part of the U.S. Army's JBC-P program, provides global real-time situational awareness and networking capabilities for U.S. warfighters and is the successor to the BFT-1 system. We expect initial shipments of MT-2025 transceivers to start during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and additional orders for our MT-2025 transceivers are ultimately expected.
Although net sales of our over-the-horizon microwave systems products for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 were lower than the comparative period of the prior year, business activity in our over-the-horizon microwave systems product line continues to pick-up. During the nine months ended April 30, 2018, we shipped certain troposcatter equipment to support U.S. Army activities throughout the Korean Peninsula. We believe demand for our over-the-horizon microwave systems will increase and have recently submitted a proposal to supply a significant quantity of our over-the-horizon microwave systems to the U.S. Army. We teamed with a large prime contractor and we are hopeful that we can win this multi-million dollar award in fiscal 2019.
Sales to U.S. government customers include sales to the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as sales directly to or through prime contractors. 
Domestic sales include sales to commercial customers, as well as to U.S. state and local governments. Included in domestic sales, are sales to Verizon Communications Inc. ("Verizon"), which represented 10.6% of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2018. Sales to Verizon were less than 10.0% of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2017. 
International sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $100.0 million and $116.6 million, respectively. Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10.0% of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017. 
Gross Profit. Gross profit was $161.0 million and $157.8 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase of $3.2 million in gross profit dollars was largely driven by higher net sales and overall favorable product mix changes in our Commercial Solutions segment, offset by significantly lower net sales of over-the-horizon microwave systems products and the absence of $6.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees in our Government Solutions segment, as discussed above. Gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, increased from 39.2% for the nine months ended April 30, 2017 to 39.9% for the nine months ended April 30, 2018. The increase in gross profit percentage is largely attributable to a greater percentage of our consolidated net sales during the nine months ended April 30, 2018 occurring in our Commercial Solutions segment, which historically achieves higher gross margins than our Government Solutions segment, as well as a favorable warranty settlement during the nine months ended April 30, 2018 that resulted in a $0.7 million reduction to cost of sales (which is reflected in our unallocated segment). Gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, is further discussed below.
Our Commercial Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 was higher than the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher net sales and overall favorable product mix changes (including earlier than expected shipments of satellite earth station equipment to the U.S. Navy) during the most recent nine month period. Given timing and other product mix changes, gross profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 in this segment is expected to decline from the level achieved in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Overall, we expect gross profit in this segment, as a percentage of related fiscal 2018 net sales, to be comparable to the percentage achieved in fiscal 2017.
Amortization of stock-based compensation expense recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses was $2.6 million for both the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The most recent nine month period includes a $0.4 million reversal of stock-based compensation expense related to certain performance shares previously expected to be earned. 
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2018 selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be comparable to fiscal 2017. 
Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $40.0 million and $40.4 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing a decrease of $0.4 million. As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 9.9% and 10.0% for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
For the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, research and development expenses of $34.5 million and $33.4 million, respectively, related to our Commercial Solutions segment and $5.3 million and $6.8 million, respectively, related to our Government Solutions segment. The remaining research and development expenses of $0.2 million for both the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the amortization of stock-based compensation expense. 
We continue to invest in enhancements to existing products as well as in new products across almost all of our product lines. Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2018 research and development expenses, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be comparable to fiscal 2017.
Amortization of Intangibles. Amortization relating to intangible assets with finite lives was $15.8 million (of which $13.3 million was for the Commercial Solutions segment and $2.5 million was for the Government Solutions segment) for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and $17.6 million (of which $13.3 million was for the Commercial Solutions segment and $4.3 million was for the Government Solutions segment) for the nine months ended April 30, 2017. The decrease is a result of certain intangibles that became fully amortized in fiscal 2017. As such, we anticipate amortization of intangibles in fiscal 2018 to be lower than in fiscal 2017.
Settlement of Intellectual Property Litigation. During the nine months ended April 30, 2017, we recorded a favorable adjustment to operating income of $12.0 million, net of estimated legal fees, to reflect a lower loss than originally estimated for a TCS intellectual property matter which was settled during that period. There was no comparable adjustment in the nine months ended April 30, 2018.
The increase during the most recent nine month period in our Commercial Solutions segment’s operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily due to higher net sales, overall favorable product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above. Given earlier than expected shipments of satellite earth station equipment to the U.S. Navy, our third quarter of fiscal 2018 is expected to be the peak quarter of operating income for this segment. Overall, we expect fiscal 2018 operating income in our Commercial Solutions segment, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to increase as compared to fiscal 2017.
The decrease during the most recent nine month period in our Government Solutions segment's operating income, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was driven by lower net sales, most notably significantly lower over-the-horizon microwave systems sales and the absence of $6.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above. Based on the strength of our third quarter performance, an assessment of timing associated with our current backlog and updated product mix assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2018 (including lower expected sales of higher margin cyber training software solutions), we expect this segment's operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to be comparable to the amount we achieved during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Overall, operating income for this segment, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, is expected to be higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017.
Unallocated operating expenses for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 were $13.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Excluding a $0.7 million favorable warranty settlement and a $12.0 million adjustment (both as discussed above), unallocated operating expenses for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 were $13.7 million and $13.5 million, respectively. Unallocated operating expenses for the nine months ended April 30, 2017 includes a recovery of certain legal expenses from a third party. Unallocated operating expenses for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 includes the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated.
Unallocated expenses for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 include amortization of stock-based compensation of $2.9 million and $3.0 million, respectively. Stock-based compensation for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 includes a reversal of $0.4 million of stock-based compensation expense related to certain performance shares that were previously expected to be earned. Amortization of stock-based compensation expense can fluctuate from period-to-period based on the type and timing of stock-based awards. Given the timing of anticipated fiscal 2018 awards, amortization of stock-based compensation is expected to be significantly higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to our most recent quarter. Based on the type of awards currently outstanding and awards expected to be issued during the remainder of fiscal 2018, amortization of stock-based compensation is also expected to be higher in fiscal 2018 than in fiscal 2017.
Looking forward, we expect our unallocated operating expenses in fiscal 2018 to significantly increase as compared to the $5.6 million of unallocated operating expenses for fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2017, unallocated operating expenses were offset by a number of favorable adjustments throughout the fiscal year, which aggregated $18.8 million and which are more fully discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC. Excluding the $18.8 million of favorable adjustments, unallocated operating expenses in fiscal 2017 would have been $24.4 million. Given the success of our cost reduction actions taken to date and current spending plans, we expect our unallocated operating expenses in fiscal 2018 to be lower than the $24.4 million of unallocated operating expenses incurred in fiscal 2017, prior to the favorable adjustments discussed above.
On a consolidated basis, we are targeting to achieve operating income, as a percentage of net sales, of approximately 5.2% in fiscal 2018, which compares favorably with the 3.3% of consolidated net sales we achieved in fiscal 2017 (excluding the $18.8 million of favorable adjustments to operating income discussed above). Based on the strength of our third quarter performance, an assessment of timing associated with our current backlog and updated mix assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2018, we now expect consolidated operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to be the peak quarter for the fiscal year.
Interest Expense. Interest expense was $7.6 million and $8.9 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decline in interest expense primarily reflects lower total indebtedness, which declined from $235.4 million as of April 30, 2017 to $186.4 million as of April 30, 2018. Interest expense for both periods primarily reflects interest on our Secured Credit Facility, as amended. Based on the type, terms, amount of outstanding debt (including capital leases and other obligations) and current interest rates, we estimate that our effective interest rate (including amortization of deferred financing costs) will approximate 5.4% in fiscal 2018. Our actual cash borrowing rate (which excludes the amortization of deferred financing costs) currently approximates 4.3%.
Interest (Income) and Other. Interest (income) and other for both the nine months ended April 30, 2018 and 2017 was nominal. All of our available cash and cash equivalents are currently invested in bank deposits and money market deposit accounts which, at this time, are currently yielding a blended annual interest rate of approximately 0.64%.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2018, we recorded an estimated net discrete tax benefit of $14.1 million which, as a result of Tax Reform, primarily related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities associated with non-deductible amortization related to intangible assets. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended April 30, 2017 reflects a net discrete tax expense of less than $0.1 million. Excluding discrete tax items for the nine months ended April 30, 2018, our estimated effective tax rate was 27.0%. Our effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax items, for the nine months ended April 30, 2017 was 36.0%. The decrease from 36.0% to 27.0% is principally attributable to the passage of Tax Reform which reduced the statutory income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, or a blended income tax rate of approximately 27.0%.
Net Income. During the nine months ended April 30, 2018, consolidated net income was $22.3 million as compared $8.5 million during the nine months ended April 30, 2017. 
The increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA during the nine months ended April 30, 2018 as compared to the nine months ended April 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to overall favorable product mix changes (including a higher percentage of consolidated net sales occurring in the Commercial Solutions segment as compared to the prior year period), the benefit of cost reduction actions previously taken and a favorable warranty settlement during the nine months ended April 30, 2018 that resulted in a $0.7 million reduction to cost of sales, as discussed above. 
The increase in our Commercial Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, during the most recent nine month period, was primarily attributable to higher net sales, overall favorable product mix changes and the benefit of cost reduction actions previously initiated, as discussed above.
The decrease in our Government Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, during the most recent nine month period was primarily driven by lower net sales, most notably significantly lower sales of over-the-horizon microwave systems products and the absence of $6.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees, as discussed above. As a result of the aforementioned change in product mix assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2018, our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA in this segment is expected to be lower than the amount we reported in our most recent period.
Looking forward, we anticipate consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to increase in the fourth quarter as compared to the amount we achieved in the third quarter.
Given our year-to-date performance, we are targeting fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA to grow close to 6.0% over the $70.7 million we achieved in fiscal 2017. In addition, despite the absence of $6.7 million of BFT-1 intellectual property license fees (which the U.S. Army is no longer obligated to pay us to support the BFT-1 system), we expect Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of fiscal 2018 consolidated net sales, to be close to 13.0%, which is slightly higher than the 12.8% we achieved in fiscal 2017. We believe these targeted financial metrics demonstrate the strength of our business. If order flow remains strong and we are able to achieve all of our fiscal 2018 business goals, it is possible that our fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA financial metrics could be higher than our targeted amounts. 
Our investment policy relating to our cash and cash equivalents is intended to minimize principal loss while at the same time maximize the income we receive without significantly increasing risk. To minimize risk, we generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in money market mutual funds (both government and commercial), certificates of deposit, bank deposits, and U.S. Treasury securities. Many of our money market mutual funds invest in direct obligations of the U.S. government, bank securities guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, certificates of deposit and commercial paper and other securities issued by other companies. While we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, we believe our investment policies are appropriate in the current environment. Ultimately, the availability of our cash and cash equivalents is dependent on a well-functioning liquid market.
On September 27, 2017, December 6, 2017 and March 7, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, which were paid on November 17, 2017, February 16, 2018 and May 18, 2018, respectively. On June 6, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable on August 17, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 16, 2018. Future dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, as well as Board approval.
We continue to receive (and approve on a limited basis) requests from our customers for higher credit limits and longer payment terms. We also continue to monitor our accounts receivable credit portfolio and have not had material negative customer credit experiences historically.
We have historically met both our short-term and long-term cash requirements with funds provided by a combination of cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operating activities and cash generated from financing transactions. Based on our anticipated level of future sales and operating income, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, our cash generated from operating activities and amounts potentially available under the Revolving Loan Facility under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, will be sufficient to meet both our currently anticipated short-term and long-term operating cash requirements. 
The Revolving Loan Facility is primarily used for working capital and other general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the issuance of letters of credit. Borrowings under the Secured Credit Facility, pursuant to terms defined in the Secured Credit Facility, shall be either (i) Alternate Base Rate ("ABR") borrowings, which bear interest from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to (x) the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 0.50% per annum and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate on such day (or, if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) plus 1.00% per annum (provided that if the LIBO Rate is less than 1.00%, then the LIBO Rate shall be deemed to be 1.00%), plus (y) the Applicable Rate, or (ii) Eurodollar borrowings, which bear interest from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to (x) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such interest period (provided that if the LIBO Rate is less than 1.00%, then the LIBO Rate shall be deemed to be 1.00%) plus (y) the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate is determined based on a pricing grid that is dependent upon our leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Secured Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants and customary negative covenants, subject to negotiated exceptions, on (i) liens, (ii) investments, (iii) indebtedness, (iv) significant corporate changes, including mergers and acquisitions, (v) dispositions, (vi) restricted payments, including stockholder dividends, and (vii) certain other restrictive agreements. The Secured Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants and customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate), such as payment defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency, the occurrence of a defined change in control and the failure to observe the negative covenants and other covenants related to the operation of our business. 
As of April 30, 2018, our Leverage Ratio was 2.43x TTM Consolidated EBITDA compared to the maximum allowable Leverage Ratio of 3.10x TTM Consolidated EBITDA. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the maximum allowable Leverage Ratio will decrease to 3.00x TTM Consolidated EBITDA, with no further reductions thereafter. Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as of April 30, 2018 was 2.36x compared to the minimum required Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.25x. The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will not change for the remaining term of the Secured Credit Facility, as amended. Given our expected future business performance, we anticipate maintaining compliance with the terms and financial covenants in our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, for the foreseeable future. 
The obligations under the Secured Credit Facility, as amended, are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary Guarantors"). As collateral security for amounts outstanding under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, and the guarantees thereof, we and our Subsidiary Guarantors have granted to an administrative agent, for the benefit of the lenders, a lien on, and first priority security interest in, substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth for such terms in the Secured Credit Facility, dated as of February 23, 2016, and the First Amendment of the Secured Credit Facility, dated as of June 6, 2017, both of which have been documented and filed with the SEC.
As discussed further in "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (9) - Secured Credit Facility," on June 6, 2017, we entered into the June 2017 Amendment to our Secured Credit Facility. In connection with this amendment, the balloon or final payment of the Term Loan Facility, which is not due until February 23, 2021, was reduced by $22.5 million through increased borrowings from the Revolving Loan Facility which is not required to be repaid in full until February 23, 2021.
As discussed further in "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (17) - Stockholders’ Equity," on June 6, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable on August 17, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 16, 2018. Future dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, as well as Board approval.
We have change in control agreements, severance agreements and indemnification agreements with certain of our executive officers and certain key employees. All of these agreements may require payments by us, in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, a change in control of our Company or an involuntary termination of employment without cause. 
We are required to prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") which is the source for all authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which is commonly referred to as "GAAP." The FASB ASC is subject to updates by the FASB, which are known as Accounting Standards Updates ("ASUs"). 
•FASB ASU No. 2016-09, which amends several aspects of the accounting for and reporting of share-based payment transactions. Our adoption of this ASU, on August 1, 2017, did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. See "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement - Note (12) - Stock-Based Compensation" for further information regarding our adoption of this ASU. 
•FASB ASU No. 2017-09, which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in ASC Topic 718. An entity would not be required to account for changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification if there were no changes to the award’s fair value, vesting conditions and classification. Our adoption of this ASU on February 1, 2018 did not have any impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
•FASB ASU No. 2016-13, issued in June 2016, which requires the measurement of expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date to be based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (our fiscal year beginning on August 1, 2020), including interim periods within those fiscal years. All entities may adopt the amendments in this ASU earlier as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Except for a prospective transition approach required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date, an entity will apply the amendments in this ASU through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (that is, on a modified-retrospective approach). We are evaluating the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
•FASB ASU No. 2016-16, issued in October 2016, as amended by ASU 2018-05 in March 2018, which eliminates a prior exception and now requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory (for example, intellectual property and property, plant and equipment) when the transfer occurs. These ASU's are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (our fiscal year beginning on August 1, 2018), and interim periods within those fiscal years and shall be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of these ASU's are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
•FASB ASU No. 2017-11, issued in July 2017, which provides guidance on the accounting for certain financial instruments with embedded features that result in the strike price of the instrument or embedded conversion option being reduced on the basis of the pricing of future equity offerings (commonly referred to as "down round" features).

•FASB ASU No. 2017-12, issued in August 2017, which expands and refines hedge accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and simplifies and aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 (our fiscal year beginning on August 1, 2019) and for interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements and disclosures; however, we do not expect the adoption to have any effect given that we historically have not engaged in hedge transactions.
