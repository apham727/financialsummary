Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from borrowings under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended. Based on the amount of outstanding debt under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, a hypothetical change in interest rates by 10% would change interest expense by $0.8 million over a one-year period. Although we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes, we may choose to do so in the future in connection with our Secured Credit Facility, as amended.
