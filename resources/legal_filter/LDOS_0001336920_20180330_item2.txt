Our domestic customers include the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, several other U.S. government civil agencies and state and local government agencies.
Business Environment and Trends



U.S. Government Markets



During the quarter ended March 30, 2018, we generated approximately 85% of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. government.
Accordingly, our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. government spending, especially on national security, homeland security and intelligence, and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the U.S. government.
On March 23, 2018, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Omnibus Appropriation Bill thereby funding the federal government through the end of the 2018 government fiscal year ("GFY").
All 12 Appropriation bills were funded and no federal department or agency is now operating under a continuing resolution.
The budget legislation passed earlier in the year suspended budget caps and included a two-year budget agreement that provides $300 billion in sequestration relief for defense and non-defense spending.
Defense programs will see additional funding of $80 billion and $85 billion in GFY 2018 and GFY 2019, respectively, and non-defense spending will increase by $63 billion and $68 billion in GFY 2018 and GFY 2019, respectively, over the caps established in the Budget Control Act of 2011.
The legislation also suspends the debt ceiling until March 2019.
Congress is now addressing GFY 2019 spending and the passage of all 12 Appropriation bills for the year beginning October 1, 2018.



International Markets



Sales to customers in international markets represented approximately 10% of total revenues for the quarter ended March 30, 2018.
Our international business increases our exposure to international markets and the associated international regulatory and geopolitical risks.
Lockheed Martin Transaction



On August 16, 2016, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leidos Holdings, Inc. merged with the Information Systems & Global Solutions business (the "IS&GS Business") of Lockheed Martin in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the "Transactions").
The acquired IS&GS Business was renamed Leidos Innovations Corporation.

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.



On January 10, 2018, the final amount of the net working capital of the IS&GS Business was determined through a binding arbitration proceeding in accordance with the Separation Agreement with Lockheed Martin.
On January 18, 2018, the final working capital amount of $105 million was paid to Lockheed Martin.
We incurred integration costs of $11 million and $18 million during the three months ended March 30, 2018, and March 31, 2017, respectively, and expect to incur additional integration costs in connection with the Transactions through fiscal 2020.
We recognized restructuring expenses of $6 million and $13 million during the three months ended March 30, 2018, and March 31, 2017, respectively, related to this program.
We anticipate this restructuring program to last through fiscal 2024 and expect to incur a total of approximately $85 million in connection with these restructuring activities.
Key Performance Measures



The primary financial performance measures we use to manage our business and monitor results of operations are revenue, operating income, cash flows from operations and diluted EPS.
The decrease in revenues in constant currency(1) for the three months ended March 30, 2018, was 5.7% as compared to an actual decrease in revenues of 5.3%.
There was a foreign currency benefit attributable to our U.K. business in the Civil segment as compared to the same period in the prior year.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________



(1) The non-GAAP measure of constant currency revenues is used to assess the performance of revenue activity without the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
We calculate revenues on a constant currency basis by translating current period revenue using the comparable period's foreign currency exchange rates.
This calculation is performed for all subsidiaries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.
The decrease in revenues for the three months ended March 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily attributable to timing of revenue recognition on certain contracts, the completion of certain contracts and net volume decreases, partially offset by revenues from new awards.
The increase in operating income for the three months ended March 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was due to net profit write-downs in the prior year quarter and stronger program performance in the current year quarter.
The increase in operating income for the three months ended March 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to stronger program performance and lower intangible asset amortization during the prior year quarter.

NM - Not meaningful



The increase in operating loss for the three months ended March 30, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, was primarily attributable to an asset impairment charge of $7 million and higher corporate costs due to bid and proposal, business development and marketing.
This was partially offset by lower acquisition and integration costs of $8 million and restructuring expenses of $7 million.
Non-Operating Expense, net



Non-operating expense, net of $34 million for the three months ended March 30, 2018, was consistent as compared to $33 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

We received net bookings worth an estimated $2.5 billion during the three months ended March 30, 2018, compared to $1.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The estimated value of our total backlog was as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Total backlog at March 30, 2018 included $88 million of benefit due to the exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the British pound.
Our total backlog consists of remaining performance obligations (see "Note 4–Revenue") and unexercised option periods.

Summary of Cash Flows



 The following table summarizes cash flow information for the periods presented:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Net cash provided by operating activities increased $93 million for the three months ended March 30, 2018, when compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher advance contract payments from customers, timing of collections of receivables and lower payments for integration and restructuring costs, partially offset by cash paid of $24 million related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&GS Business.
Net cash used in investing activities increased $91 million for the three months ended March 30, 2018, when compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to cash paid of $81 million related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&GS Business and higher purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Net cash used in financing activities increased $13 million for the three months ended March 30, 2018, when compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the repurchase of shares of common stock under the share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of $10 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



We have outstanding performance guarantees and cross-indemnity agreements in connection with certain aspects of our business.
We also have letters of credit outstanding principally related to performance guarantees on contracts and surety bonds outstanding principally related to performance and payment bonds as described in "Note 21–Commitments" of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
For a discussion of these items, see "Note 20–Contingencies" and "Note 21–Commitments" of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Revenue Recognition



Our revenues from contracts with customers are from offerings including cybersecurity; data analytics; enterprise IT modernization; operations and logistics; sensors, collection and phenomenology; software development; and systems engineering, primarily with the U.S. government and its agencies.
We perform under various types of contracts, which include firm-fixed-price ("FFP"), time-and-materials ("T&M"), fixed-price-level-of-effort ("FP-LOE"), cost-plus-fixed-fee ("CPFF"), cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee and fixed-price-incentive-fee ("FP-IF") contracts.

To determine the proper revenue recognition, we first evaluate whether it has a duly approved and enforceable contract with a customer, in which the rights of the parties and payment terms are identified, and collectability is probable.
In addition, we assess contract modifications to determine whether the changes to existing contracts should be accounted for as part of the original contract or as a separate contract.
Contract modifications for us generally relate to changes in contract specifications and requirements and do not add distinct services, and therefore are accounted for as part of the original contract.
If contract modifications add distinct goods or services and increase the contract value by the standalone selling price, those modifications are accounted for as separate contracts.
Most of our contracts comprise multiple promises including the design and build of software-based systems, integration of hardware and software solutions, running and maintaining of IT infrastructure and procurement services.
We generally separate multiple promises in a contract as separate performance obligations if those promises are distinct, both individually and in the context of the contract.
If multiple promises in a contract are highly interrelated or comprise a series of distinct services performed over time, they are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation.
Our contracts with the U.S. government often contain options to renew existing contracts for an additional period of time (generally a year at a time) under the same terms and conditions as the original contract, and generally do not provide the customer any material rights under the contract.
We account for renewal options as separate contracts when they include distinct goods or services at standalone selling prices.
Contracts with the U.S. government are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") and priced on an estimated or actual costs of providing the goods or services.
The FAR provides guidance on types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided to the U.S. government and its agencies.
Each contract is competitively priced and bid separately.
Pricing for non-U.S. government agencies and commercial customers is based on specific negotiations with each customer.
We exclude any taxes collected or imposed when determining the transaction price.
Certain of our cost-plus and fixed-price contracts contain award fees, incentive fees or other provisions that may either increase or decrease the transaction price.
These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion.
We allocate the transaction price of a contract to our performance obligations in the proportion of its respective standalone selling prices.
The standalone selling price of our performance obligations is generally based on an expected cost-plus margin approach, in accordance with the FAR.
For certain product sales, we use prices from other standalone sales.
Substantially none of our contracts contain a significant financing component, which would require an adjustment to the transaction price of the contract.
We recognize revenue on our services contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as we perform the promised services.
For U.S. government contracts, continuous transfer of control to the customer is evidenced by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work-in-process.

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.



On FFP contracts, revenue recognized over time generally uses a method that measures the extent of progress towards completion of a performance obligation, principally using a cost-input method (referred to as the cost-to-cost method).
Under the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total cost incurred to estimated total costs at completion ("EAC").
On certain other contracts, principally T&M, FP-LOE, and cost-plus, revenue is recognized using the right-to-invoice practical expedient as we are contractually able to invoice the customer based on the control transferred to the customer.
Additionally, on maintenance (generally FFP) performance obligations, revenue is recognized over time using a straight-line method as the control of the services is provided to the customer evenly over the period of performance.
In such cases, we recognize revenue on a net basis.
We do not incur significant incremental costs to acquire contracts.
Contract costs incurred for U.S. government contracts, including indirect costs, are subject to audit and adjustment by the Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA").
