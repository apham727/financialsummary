Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
Foreign Currency 
We translate all assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency, at the period-end exchange rate and translate sales and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. The net effect of these translation adjustments is recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as Comprehensive Income. The translation adjustment was a gain of approximately $600 and $700 for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Translation adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Net foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in other income, net amounted to a loss of $138 and $70 for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to our most significant foreign currency net assets would have had an impact of approximately $6,300 on our foreign net assets as of March 31, 2018. 
Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 1.50%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 0.50%), in each case depending on the CompanyÂ’s ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA. We use interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 (representing 50% of the Term Loan balance at that time) that amortize quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at maturity. The notional amount changes over time as loan payments are made. As a requirement of the debt refinance, one of the swaps was liquidated. In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022.
