Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
Based on managementÂ’s evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2018, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
The Company implemented a financial reporting system, Hyperion Financial Management (HFM), as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes. The implementation occurred in phases throughout 2017 and was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company utilized and relied on HFM during the first quarter of 2018. 
As a result of the HFM implementation, certain changes to our processes and procedures have and will continue to occur. These changes will result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. While HFM is designed to strengthen our internal financial controls by automating certain manual processes and standardizing business processes and reporting across our organization, management will continue to evaluate and monitor our internal controls as each of the affected areas evolve.
