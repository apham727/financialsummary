Interest rates on our Revolving Facility are based on the LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 2.25% (currently 1.50%) or the Prime Rate plus a margin of 0% to 1.25% (currently 0.50%), in each case depending on the CompanyÂ’s ratio of total funded indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA. We use interest rate derivatives to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. We primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. During October 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $25,000 that amortized quarterly to a notional of $6,673 at the September 2018 maturity. Neither of these interest rate swaps is currently active, one was liquidated as part of the 2016 debt refinancing and the other matured in September 2018. In February 2017, we entered into three interest rate swaps with a combined notional of $40,000 that matures in February 2022 As of September 30, 2018, we had $62,480 outstanding under the Revolving Facility, of which $40,000 is currently being hedged. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our outstanding debt. A hypothetical one percentage point (100 basis points) change in the Base Rate on the $22,480 of unhedged floating rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2018 would have an impact of approximately $60 on our interest expense for the third quarter 2018 and $200 on our interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
