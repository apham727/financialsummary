Forward Looking Statements 
General Discussion 
We pursue a strategy of focusing primarily on quality control products and services, which are sold into niche markets that are driven by regulatory requirements. We prefer markets in which we can establish a strong presence and achieve high gross margins. We are organized into four divisions across nine physical locations. Our Sterilization and Disinfection Control Division (“SDC” Division) manufactures and sells biological, cleaning, and chemical indicators. Biological, cleaning, and chemical indicators are used to assess the effectiveness of sterilization and disinfection processes in the hospital, dental, medical device, and pharmaceutical industries. The division also provides testing and laboratory services, mainly to the dental industry. Our Instruments Division designs, manufactures, and markets quality control instruments and disposable products utilized in the healthcare, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, medical device, industrial hygiene, and environmental air sampling industries. Our Cold Chain Monitoring Division designs, develops, and markets systems which are used to monitor various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and differential pressure to ensure that critical storage and processing conditions are maintained in hospitals, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, blood banks, pharmacies, and laboratory environments. Our Cold Chain Packaging Division provides packaging development consulting services and thermal packaging products such as coolers, boxes, insulation materials, and phase-change products to control temperature during the customer’s transport of their own products. 
General Trends  
Our strategic objectives include growth both organically and through further acquisitions. During the six months ended September 30, 2018, we continued to build our infrastructure to prepare for future growth, including completing the relocation and sale of the old Bozeman manufacturing facility, moving those operations into the new Bozeman building, the addition of key personnel to our operations, sales and marketing, and research and development teams, and the continued rollout of phase three of our ERP implementation project (European operations). 
The markets for sterilization and disinfection control products remain strong, as the disposable nature of these products makes them less sensitive to general economic conditions. The worldwide market for sterilization and disinfection control products is growing as more countries focus on verifying the effectiveness of sterilization and disinfection processes. 
Overall revenues increased eight percent, while organic revenues increased three percent, for the three months ended September 30, 2018, resulting from organic increases of nine percent and three percent from the Instruments and SDC Divisions, respectively, partially offset by organic decreases of six percent and 11 percent for the Cold Chain Monitoring and Cold Chain Packaging Divisions, respectively. Overall revenues increased 10 percent, while organic revenues increased three percent, for the six months ended September 30, 2018, resulting from organic increases of 23 percent, five percent, and two percent from the Cold Chain Packaging, Instruments, and Cold Chain Monitoring Divisions, respectively, partially offset by an organic decrease of one percent for the SDC Division. 
Revenues 
Three and six months ended September 30, 2018 versus September 30, 2017 
Cold Chain Monitoring revenues decreased six percent and increased two percent for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. Revenues in this division fluctuate quarter over quarter due to the timing of performance obligations and the nature and timing of orders and installations within any given quarter. 
Cold Chain Packaging revenues decreased 11 percent and increased 24 percent for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, as a result of changes in the order rate of the division’s largest customer. During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the customer’s order rate was higher than usual, resulting in organic growth for the six months ended September 30, 2018. The higher-than-usual order rate was not sustained in the second quarter, resulting in organic growth declines for the three months ended September 30, 2018.  
Three and six months ended September 30, 2018 versus September 30, 2017 
Sterilization and Disinfection Control gross profit margin percentage increased for both the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 primarily as a result of $291 and $353 of moving expenses related to the Bozeman facility that were incurred during the three and six months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. Excluding the impact of the moving expenses, gross margin percentage for both periods was essentially flat as compared to the prior year. 
Instruments gross margin percentage was flat during the three months ended September 30, 2018. Instruments gross margin percentage increased during the six months ended September 30, 2018 due to favorable product and service mix, as well as a $163 increase in inventory reserve recorded in the six months ended September 30, 2017 as a result of the decision to discontinue the sale of certain instruments products. 
Cold Chain Monitoring gross profit margin percentage increased during the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to efficiency gains as well as a one-time incremental inventory reserve charge of $216 recorded in the six months ended September 30, 2017. 
Selling 
Three and six months ended September 30, 2018 versus September 30, 2017 
Selling expense is driven primarily by labor costs, including salaries and commissions; accordingly, it may vary with sales levels. Selling expense for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 decreased 21 percent and 26 percent, respectively, primarily due to timing of the reduction and replacement of selling personnel. As a percentage of revenues, selling expense was seven percent for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to 10 percent and 11 percent for the three and six months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. We plan to continue to strategically reinvest in sales and marketing resources in an effort to further increase organic revenues growth. 
General and Administrative 
Three and six months ended September 30, 2018 versus September 30, 2017 
Labor costs, including non-cash stock-based compensation, and amortization of intangible assets drive the substantial majority of general and administrative expense. General and administrative expenses increased $1,081 during the three months ended September 30, 2018, due primarily to $718 of increases in non-cash stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets. General and administrative costs increased $1,824 during the six months ended September 30, 2018, due primarily to $1,198 of increases in non-cash stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets. 
Research and Development 
Three and six months ended September 30, 2018 versus September 30, 2017 
Three and six months ended September 30, 2018 versus September 30, 2017 
During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded a $3,300 estimated legal settlement expense; see Note 9. “Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 1. Financial Statements. 
Other Expense 
Other expense for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 is composed primarily of interest expense associated with our Credit Facility, offset by a $288 gain recorded on the sale of our Bozeman facility; see Note 4. “Facility Relocation” within Item 1. Financial Statements for more information. 
Net Income 
Our sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, working capital, capacity under our Credit Facility, and potential equity and debt offerings. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term needs. Our more significant uses of resources have historically included long-term capital equipment expenditures, payment of debt obligations, quarterly dividends to shareholders, and acquisitions. Working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. We had working capital of $14,059 and $14,698 at September 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively. 
Given our cash flow projections and unused capacity on our line of credit that is available until March 1, 2022, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements for our general business needs. Interest-bearing debt of $33,375 and $46,625 was outstanding at September 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, respectively. The Term Loan requires 20 quarterly principal payments, which began on March 31, 2017, in the amount of $250,000 (increasing by $125,000 each year up to $750,000 in the fifth year). The remaining balance of principal and accrued interest are due on March 1, 2022. We were in compliance with all loan agreements at September 30, 2018 and for all prior years presented and have met all debt payment obligations. 
As of June 30, 2018, our previously-announced move of our Omaha, Traverse City, and old Bozeman manufacturing facilities to our new facility in Bozeman, Montana was complete. We also completed the sale of our old Bozeman facility during the period ended September 30, 2018, which resulted in a gain of $288. 
Dividends 
In October 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock, payable on December 17, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2018.
