We pursue a strategy of focusing primarily on quality control products and services, which are sold into niche markets that are driven by regulatory requirements. We prefer markets where we can establish a strong presence and achieve high gross margins. We are organized into four divisions across ten physical locations. Our Instruments Division designs, manufactures and markets quality control instruments and disposable products utilized in the healthcare, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, medical device, industrial hygiene and environmental air sampling industries. Our Sterilization and Disinfection Control Division (formerly named the Biological Indicators Division) provides testing services, along with the manufacturing and marketing of both biological and cleaning indicators, and the marketing of chemical indicators used to assess the effectiveness of sterilization and disinfection processes in the hospital, dental, medical device and pharmaceutical industries. Our Cold Chain Monitoring Division designs, develops and markets systems which are used to monitor various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and differential pressure to ensure that critical storage and processing conditions are maintained in hospitals, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, blood banks, pharmacies and other laboratory and industrial environments. Our Cold Chain Packaging Division provides packaging development consulting services and thermal packaging products such as coolers, boxes, insulation materials and phase-change products to control temperature during transport. 
In April 2016, we completed a business combination (the “ATS Acquisition”) whereby we acquired substantially all the assets (other than cash and certain inventories and fixed assets) and certain liabilities of Autoclave Testing Services, Inc. and Autoclave Testing Supplies, Inc., (collectively, “ATS”). ATS was in the business of supplying products and services for dental sterilizer testing in both the U.S. and Canada; and 
Our strategic objectives include growth both organically and through further acquisitions. During the year ending March 31, 2018, we continue to build our infrastructure to prepare for future growth, including the relocation of our Omaha, Traverse City and old Bozeman manufacturing facilities into the new Bozeman building, the addition of key personnel to our operations, sales and marketing, and research and development teams and the rollout of phase three of our ERP implementation project (European operations).  
The markets for sterilization and disinfection control products remain strong, as the disposable nature of these products makes them less sensitive to general economic conditions. The worldwide market for sterilization and disinfection control products is growing as more countries focus on verifying the effectiveness of sterilization and disinfection processes.  
Overall revenues declined one percent, while organic revenues declined four percent, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, resulting from organic decreases of nine and 36 percent from the Instruments and Cold Chain Packaging Divisions, respectively, partially offset by increases of seven and three percent for the Sterilization and Disinfection Control and Cold Chain Monitoring Divisions, respectively. Overall revenues were flat, while organic revenues declined two percent, for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 resulting from organic decreases of four, four and 36 percent from the Instruments, Cold Chain Monitoring and Cold Chain Packaging Divisions, respectively, partially offset by an increase of nine percent for the Sterilization and Disinfection Control Division. 
During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we elected to discontinue for sale certain products in our Instruments, Cold Chain Monitoring and Sterilization and Disinfection Control Divisions due to the recent introduction of new or modified products and the consolidation of other product sets. As part of this process, we analyzed the remaining inventories associated with these products to determine future usability and reserved against what we believed to be excess or obsolete, resulting in an increase in our inventory reserve of $406,000 (of which $216,000 related to the Cold Chain Monitoring Division). At this time, we also established a plan to liquidate certain Cold Chain Monitoring raw material components related to the above-mentioned discontinued products. During both the three months ended September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, we subjected additional inventories to our liquidation program due to the discontinuance or winding-down of additional older product sets resulting from the release of our new ViewPoint operating platform. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, it became evident that our liquidation program was ineffective, and we determined that a significant amount of these inventories was not recoverable as previously planned. As such, we increased our Cold Chain Monitoring inventory reserve by $1,700,000. Company-wide gross margin percentage for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 was 54 and 56 percent, respectively but would have been 61 and 59 percent, respectively without the impact of these additional inventory reserves. 
During the nine months ended December 31, 2017, revenues in our Cold Chain Packaging Division decreased significantly as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a significant decrease in revenues from our largest customer and the loss of the business of one of our larger customers. Due to these two events, we believe that revenues for this segment will now be approximately $2,250,000 to $2,750,000 lower for the year ending March 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2017. During the three months ended December 31, 2017 we completed a detailed review of the cold chain packaging business and concluded that long and difficult sales-cycles associated with this product set, when coupled with higher than previously contemplated costs for operating and expanding the necessary infrastructure to support revenues growth, have resulted in a forecast of lower than expected revenues, gross margin percentages and overall profitability as compared to our original model for this business. Based on these facts, we concluded that we had a triggering event requiring assessment of impairment for certain of our long-lived assets associated with the Cold Chain Packaging Division. As a result, we reviewed the long-lived assets associated with this reporting segment and recorded a $13,819,000 impairment charge related to goodwill, which is included in impairment charge of goodwill on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017.  
Sterilization and Disinfection Control revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 increased primarily due to the 2018 Acquisitions and organic growth of seven and nine percent, respectively which was achieved through existing customers, expansion into new markets, price increases and the continued strengthening of the Euro.  
Instruments revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 decreased due to organic decreases of nine and four percent, respectively. The decrease for both the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the slower than expected adoption of an updated medical product. We realized a normalization of the adoption rate of this product towards the end of the quarter and as such we ramped up production to meet anticipated future demand. 
Cold Chain Monitoring revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased primarily due to organic growth of three percent and the FreshLoc Acquisition. Cold Chain Monitoring revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 increased primarily due to the FreshLoc Acquisition, partially offset by organic decreases of four percent. Revenues in this division fluctuate quarter over quarter due to the timing of customer acceptance of certain installations and the nature and timing of orders within any given quarter. 
Sterilization and Disinfection Control gross profit margin percentage increased for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to volume based efficiencies associated with increased revenues and the impact of using internally manufactured biological indicators for our dental sterilizer testing business as opposed to the prior year where we were contractually committed to purchase a significant portion of those biological indicators from an outside supplier at a significantly higher price. 
Selling expense for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 decreased primarily due to reductions of selling personnel, trade show activities and outside commissions. As a percentage of revenues, selling expense was eight and 10 percent for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, respectively as compared to 10 and 11 percent for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016. 
Historically selling expense approximates 10 percent to 12 percent of revenues. 
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased primarily due to acquisition related and amortization expenses, partially offset by a decrease in personnel expenses. 
General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 increased primarily due to increased personnel, employee moving, acquisition related and amortization expenses, partially offset by decreases in professional services expenses. 
Research and development expenses for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 decreased due to a streamlining of the necessary engineers and materials and supplies required to support existing businesses during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017. 
Impairment loss on goodwill for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 is associated with our Packaging Division. See General Trends and Outlook above for additional discussion. 
Other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 is comprised primarily of interest expense associated with our Credit Facility. 
Other expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 is comprised primarily of interest expense associated with our Credit Facility and $300,000 related to an additional accrual for the PCD earn-out (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional discussion), partially offset by a $116,000 gain from the sale of our Omaha facility. 
Our income tax rate varies based upon many factors (please see Note 12, Item 1. Financial Statements for additional discussion). Net income for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 was also significantly impacted by a $13,819,000 impairment loss on goodwill  (see General Trends and Outlook above for additional discussion), $772,000 of facility relocation costs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources), $300,000 in PCD earn-out accruals, $256,000 of employee moving expenses not related to the Bozeman facility relocation and a $2,106,000 expense related to a reserve for inventory due to operational decisions to end of life certain products and other slow moving inventory. Otherwise, net income for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 varied with the changes in revenues, gross profit and operating expenses (which includes $5,062,000 of non-cash amortization of intangible assets). 
Our sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, working capital, capacity under our Credit Facility and potential equity and debt offerings. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term needs. Our more significant uses of resources include quarterly dividends to shareholders, payment of debt obligations, long-term capital equipment expenditures and potential acquisitions.  
Due to continued organic and acquisition related growth, we outgrew the capacity of our current building in Bozeman, Montana and as a result, we built a new facility in the same general area. Construction began in July 2015 and was completed in September 2017. We spent $17,650,000 on the development of the building and the related land, which is included in property, plant and equipment, net on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
In August 2016, we announced that we plan to shut down both our Omaha and Traverse City manufacturing facilities and relocate those operations to the new Bozeman building. The move of these two facilities, along with the current Bozeman operations, began in March 2017 and is estimated to be completed by June 30, 2018. We estimate that the total costs of the relocation will be $2,100,000 (which is comprised primarily of facility moving expenses, retention bonuses for existing personnel and payroll costs for duplicative personnel during the transition period) of which $725,000 was incurred during the year ended March 31, 2017 and $772,000 was incurred during the nine months ended December 31, 2017, which is reflected in cost of revenues in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations (other than $269,000 which is included in general and administrative).  
In July 2017, we completed the move from the Omaha facility and subsequently sold that building for $1,116,000 (net of commission costs). After completing the move of the old Bozeman facility, we expect to be able to sell that building for approximately $2,500,000. 
Working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. We had working capital of $19,692,000 and $19,218,000 respectively, at December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.  
On March 1, 2017, we entered into a five-year agreement (the “Credit Facility”) for a $80,000,000 revolving line of credit (“Line of Credit”), a $20,000,000 term loan (“Term Loan”) and up to $2,500,000 of letters of credit with a banking syndicate comprised of four banks. In addition, the Credit Facility provides a post-closing accordion feature which allows the Company to request to increase the Line of Credit or Term Loan up to an additional $100,000,000. 
The Term Loan requires 20 quarterly principal payments (the first due date was March 31, 2017) in the amount of $250,000 (increasing by $125,000 each year up to $750,000 in the fifth year). The remaining balance of principal and accrued interest are due on March 1, 2022. 
The Credit Facility is secured by all of our assets and requires us to maintain a ratio of funded debt to our trailing four quarters of EBIDTA (the “Leverage Ratio”), as defined in the agreement, of less than 3.0 to 1.0, provided that, we may once during the term of the Credit Facility, in connection with a Permitted Acquisition for which the aggregate consideration paid or to be paid in respect thereof equals or exceeds $20,000,000, elect to increase the maximum Leverage Ratio permitted hereunder to (i) 3.50 to 1.00 for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such Permitted Acquisition occurs (the “Initial Holiday Period”) and (ii) 3.25 to 1.00 for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters immediately following the Initial Holiday Period. The Credit Facility also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of less than 1.25 to 1.0.  
As of January 31, 2018, we had $53,000,000 in outstanding indebtedness and unused capacity under our Credit Facility of $46,000,000 (subject to covenant restrictions). 
In April 2015, the SEC declared effective our Universal Shelf Registration Statement which allows us to sell, in one or more public offerings, common stock or warrants, or any combination of such securities for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to $130,000,000. The terms of any offering, including the type of securities involved, would be established at the time of sale. 
On November 7, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 300,000 shares of our outstanding common stock. Under the plan, the shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market at prevailing prices or in negotiated transactions off the market. Shares purchased will be canceled and repurchases will be made with existing cash reserves. We do not maintain a set policy or schedule for our buyback program. We have purchased 162,486 shares of common stock under this program from inception through December 31, 2017. 
In January 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share of common stock, payable on March 15, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2018. 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 increased primarily due to a $1,414,000 decrease of inventories (net of the impact of increases in the reserve for inventory) and, in the previous period, the payment of $5,076,000 of contingent consideration and an increase of $4,401,000 in accrued liabilities and taxes payable, partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other. 
Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 resulted from $15,433,000 associated with the 2018 Acquisitions and the purchase of $2,540,000 of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $1,133,000 of proceeds associated with the sale of the Omaha facility. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 resulted from $6,618,000 associated with the 2017 Acquisitions and the purchase of $9,367,000 of property, plant and equipment. 
Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 resulted from borrowings under our Credit Facility of $11,000,000 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $2,346,000, partially offset by the repayment of debt of $9,750,000 and the payment of dividends of $1,807,000. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 resulted from borrowings under our Credit Facility of $11,500,000 and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $2,815,000, partially offset by the repayment of debt of $3,750,000 and the payment of dividends of $1,760,000.  
At December 31, 2017, we had contractual obligations for open purchase orders of approximately $3,200,000 for routine purchases of supplies and inventory, which are payable in less than one year.  
Under the terms of the PCD Agreement, we were required to pay contingent consideration if the cumulative revenues for our process challenge device business for the three years subsequent to the acquisition met certain levels. The potential consideration payable ranged from $0 to $1,500,000 and was based upon a sliding scale of three-year cumulative revenues between $9,900,000 and $12,600,000, with payments made annually. Based upon both historical and projected growth rates, we initially recorded $300,000 of contingent consideration payable which represented our best estimate of the amount that would ultimately be paid. We paid $150,000 of the contingent consideration during the year ended March 31, 2016 (based upon the then current run rate projected over the entire three-year contingent consideration period).  
Since the initial payment, the revenues for these products significantly increased and as a result, during the year ended March 31, 2017 we recorded an additional $450,000 accrual (which was paid in our third quarter ending December 31, 2016). During the three months ended June 30, 2017 revenues continued to increase and after revising our forecast for the process challenge device (“PCD”) product revenues through the end of the earn-out period, we recorded an additional $300,000 accrual, which is included in other income, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2017. We paid the remaining contingent consideration due of $450,000 in November 2017.
