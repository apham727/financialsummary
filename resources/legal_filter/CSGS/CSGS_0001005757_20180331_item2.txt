Key Impact of U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
See Note 7 to our 2017 10-K for additional impacts of the Tax Reform Act. 
As discussed in Note 2 to our Financial Statements, in January 2018 we adopted ASU 606, a single comprehensive model which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP, utilizing the cumulative effect approach. Under the new guidance, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.  
Certain deferred contract costs that had been included in our client contracts and other current and non-current assets on our Balance Sheet were reclassified and presented separately as a non-current client contract asset, net of related amortization.  
Certain revenues and related costs previously recorded as software and services or maintenance on our Income Statement are now being classified as cloud and related solutions.  
Investments in client contracts on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows have been reclassified to operating activities from investing activities.  
As discussed in Note 5 to the Financial Statements, on February 28, 2017 we acquired Business Ink, a multi-channel communications company based in Austin, Texas, for approximately $70 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses. This represents a purchase price of slightly over one times historical revenues. For the first quarter of 2018, Business Ink contributed $5.2 million of cloud and related solutions revenues and was neutral to our results of operations for the quarter when factoring in acquired amortization expense. At this time, for the full year 2018 we expect that Business Ink will contribute approximately $50 million of revenue for the ten months of 2018 and decrease our results of operations by approximately 5%. After we complete our integration plan for Business Ink over the next year or so, we believe it will then be accretive to our earnings on a go forward basis.  
Stock-based compensation included in the table above excludes amounts that have been recorded in restructuring and reorganization charges. 
Operating Results. Operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $25.8 million, or a 12.8% operating income margin percentage, compared to $27.0 million, or a 14.0% operating income margin percentage for the first quarter of 2017, with the decreases in operating income and operating income margin percentage mainly attributed to the $2.4 million of Business Ink acquisition-related costs. 
Diluted EPS. Diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.42 compared to $0.62 for the first quarter of 2017, with the decrease mainly attributed to a lower effective income tax rate of 9% for the first quarter of 2017, compared to an effective income tax rate of 31% for the current quarter. The lower first quarter 2017 income tax rate of 9% was primarily the result of an approximately $5 million net income tax benefit resulting from Comcast’s exercise of 1.4 million vested stock warrants in January 2017. 
Cash and Cash Flows. As of March 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $222.1 million, as compared $261.4 million as of as of December 31, 2017. The quarterly decrease can be mainly attributed to the purchase of Business Ink for approximately $70 million. Our cash flows from operating activities for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $29.9 million. See the Liquidity section below for further discussion of our cash flows. 
The preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to select appropriate accounting policies, and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies. In applying our accounting policies, different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our Financial Statements. 
Cloud and Related Solutions Revenues. Cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $177.5 million, a 12% increase when compared to $158.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in cloud and related solutions revenues is primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606 which resulted in $7.0 million of revenue previously classified as software and services and maintenance revenue now being classified as cloud and related solutions revenues, and the $5.2 million of revenues generated by the acquired Business Ink business. The remaining increase is mainly attributed to the execution of additional managed services arrangements, an increase in ancillary services revenues, and the conversion of approximately four million customer accounts onto ACP over the past twelve months.  
Software and Services Revenues. Software and services revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $12.0 million, a 21% decrease when compared to $15.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in software and services revenues can be attributed mainly to the shift in our focus towards more recurring revenue arrangements, which are included in our cloud and related solutions revenues, and the adoption of ASC 606, which resulted in $1.6 million of revenue previously classified as software and services now being classified as cloud and related solutions.  
Maintenance Revenues. Maintenance revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $12.2 million, a 34% decrease when compared to $18.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, with the decrease mainly due to the adoption of ASC 606, which resulted in $5.1 million of revenue previously classified as maintenance now being classified as cloud and related solutions.  
The components of total expenses are discussed in more detail below. 
Cost of Revenues. See our 2017 10-K for a description of the types of costs that are included in the individual line items for cost of revenues. 
Cost of Cloud and Related Solutions (Exclusive of Depreciation). The cost of cloud and related solutions for the first quarter of 2018 increased 14% to $86.9 million, from $76.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. This increase relates almost entirely to the adoption of ASC 606, which resulted in $6.3 million of costs, previously classified as cost of software and services and maintenance, now being classified as cost of cloud and related solutions, and one month of cloud and related solutions expense from the acquired Business Ink business. Total cloud and related solutions cost as a percentage of cloud and related solutions revenues for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 were 49.0% and 47.9%, respectively, with the increase attributed to the reclassifications resulting from the adoption of ASC 606. 
Cost of Software and Services (Exclusive of Depreciation). The cost of software and services for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 24% to $8.5 million, from $11.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. This decrease is reflective of the decrease in revenues as personnel and the related costs previously allocated to professional services projects have been reassigned to other areas of the business. Total software and services cost as a percentage of our software and services revenues for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 were 71.4% and 74.9%, respectively. 
Cost of Maintenance (Exclusive of Depreciation). The cost of maintenance for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 46% to $5.7 million, from $10.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Total cost of maintenance as a percentage of our maintenance revenues for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 were 46.2% and 55.7%, respectively. These decreases can be attributed to the adoption of ASC 606, which resulted in $5.1 million of costs, previously classified as maintenance, now being classified as cost of cloud and related solutions.  
 Operating Income.  Operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $25.8 million, or 12.8% of total revenues, compared to $27.0 million, or 14.0% of total revenues for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in operating income and operating income margin percentage can be mainly attributed to the $2.4 million of acquisition-related costs. 
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. In March 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement (see Note 4 to our Financial Statements). As a result, we incurred a loss of $0.8 million related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. 
The lower first quarter 2017 effective income tax rate reflects an approximately $5 million net benefit resulting from Comcast’s exercise of 1.4 million vested stock warrants in January 2017, as the stock warrants appreciated in value since their vesting, resulting in an income tax benefit to us when exercised.  
As of March 31, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $222.1 million, as compared to $261.4 million as of as of December 31, 2017. We generally invest our excess cash balances in low-risk, short-term investments to limit our exposure to market and credit risks.  
During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement primarily to extend the term of the loan from February 2020 to March 2023 and obtain a reduction in the interest rate and other fees. The 2018 Credit Agreement increased our liquidity and capital resources position by approximately $30 million.  
As part of our 2018 Credit Agreement, we have a $200 million senior secured revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in March 2023. As of March 31, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding on the 2018 Revolver. The 2018 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and financial covenants. As of March 31, 2018, and the date of this filing, we believe that we are in compliance with the provisions of the 2018 Credit Agreement.  
We generally have ready access to substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances, but may face limitations on moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions due to currency controls. As of March 31, 2018, we had $2.7 million of cash restricted as to use primarily to collateralize outstanding letters of credit. 
The unbilled accounts receivable balances above are primarily the result of several transactions with various milestone and contractual billing dates which have not yet been reached. Unbilled accounts receivable are an inherent characteristic of certain software and professional services transactions and may fluctuate between quarters, as these types of transactions typically have scheduled invoicing terms over several quarters, as well as certain milestone billing events.  
As a result of the adoption of ASC 606, $1.5 million of investments in client contracts have been reclassified to operating activities from investing activities for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. 
Our financing activities typically consist of activities associated with our common stock and our long-term debt.  
Cash Dividends Paid on Common Stock. During the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, the Board approved dividend payments totaling $7.1 million and $6.7 million, respectively. During the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, we paid dividends of $7.4 million and $7.0 million, respectively (with the additional amounts attributed to dividends for incentive shares paid upon vesting).  
Repurchase of Common Stock. During the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, we repurchased 0.1 million shares of our common stock under the guidelines of our Stock Repurchase Program for $5.7 million and $5.4 million, respectively.  
During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement and as a result, we repaid the outstanding principal balance of $120.0 million and borrowed $150.0 million under the 2018 Credit Agreement, resulting in a net increase of available cash of $30.0 million. As part of the refinancing, we paid $1.4 million of deferred financing costs.  
Additionally, during the first quarter of 2017, we made principal repayments of $3.8 million. 
Long-Term Debt\Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement and as a result, we repaid the outstanding term loan principal balance of $120.0 million and borrowed $150.0 million, resulting in a net increase in cash of $30 million (the 2018 Credit Agreement). The 2018 Credit Agreement also includes a $200 million revolving loan facility (2018 Revolver). As of March 31, 2018, we had no borrowing outstanding on our 2018 Revolver and had the entire $200 million available to us. Our long-term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 4 to our Financial Statements. 
Our common stock repurchases are discussed in more detail in Note 9 to our Financial Statements. 
Cash Dividends. During the first quarter of 2018, the Board declared dividends totaling $7.1 million. Going forward, we expect to pay cash dividends each year in March, June, September, and December, with the amount and timing subject to the Board’s approval. 
Acquisitions. In February 2018, we acquired Business Ink, a privately-held multi-channel business communications company based in Austin, Texas for approximately $70 million. The acquisition was funded from currently available cash. Our acquisition of Business Ink is discussed in more detail in Note 5 to our Financial Statements. 
Capital Expenditures. During the  first quarter of 2018, we spent $12.2 million on capital expenditures. As of March 31, 2018, we had committed to purchase approximately $14 million of equipment.  
Stock Warrants. We have issued Stock Warrants with an exercise price of $26.68 per warrant to Comcast as an incentive for Comcast to convert new customer accounts to ACP. Once vested, Comcast may exercise the Stock Warrants and elect either physical delivery of common shares or net share settlement (cashless exercise). Alternatively, the exercise of the Stock Warrants may be settled with cash based solely on our approval, or if Comcast were to beneficially own or control in excess of 19.99% of the common stock or voting of the Company. As of March 31, 2018, approximately 1.4 million Stock Warrants are outstanding, of which 0.4 million are vested. 
The Stock Warrants are discussed in more detail in Note 9 to our Financial Statements.  
During the next twelve months, there are no scheduled conversion triggers on our 2016 Convertible Notes. As a result, we expect our required debt service cash outlay during the next twelve months for the 2016 Convertible Notes to be limited to interest payments of $9.8 million. 
Our 2018 Credit Agreement mandatory repayments and the cash interest expense (based upon current interest rates) for the next twelve months is $7.5 million, and $6.4 million, respectively. We have the ability to make prepayments on our 2018 Credit Agreement without penalty.  
Our long-term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 4 to our Financial Statements.
