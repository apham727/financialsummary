Key Impact of U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  
As discussed in Note 2 to our Financial Statements, in January 2018 we adopted ASU 606, a single comprehensive model which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP, utilizing the cumulative effect approach. Under the new guidance, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.  
Certain deferred contract costs that had been included in our client contracts and other current and non-current assets on our Balance Sheet were reclassified and presented separately as a non-current client contract asset, net of related amortization.  
Investments in client contracts on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows have been reclassified to operating activities from investing activities.  
As discussed in Note 5 to the Financial Statements, on February 28, 2017 we acquired Business Ink, a multi-channel communications company based in Austin, Texas, for approximately $70 million, excluding acquisition-related expenses. This represents a purchase price of slightly over one times historical revenues. For the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018, Business Ink contributed cloud and related solutions revenues of $15.7 million and $21.0 million, respectively, of and was slightly dilutive to our results of operations when factoring in acquired amortization expense.  
Stock-based compensation included in the table above excludes amounts that have been recorded in restructuring and reorganization charges. 
Operating Results. Operating income for the second quarter of 2018 was $24.1 million, or an 11.3% operating income margin percentage, compared to $24.2 million, or a 12.6% operating income margin percentage for the second quarter of 2017, with the decrease in operating margin reflective of costs associated with the integration of Business Ink and the continued increase in planned investments aimed at generating future long-term growth in our business. 
Diluted EPS. Diluted EPS for the second quarter of 2018 was $0.46 compared to $0.35 for the second quarter of 2017, with the increase mainly attributed a lower effective income tax rate, primarily resulting from the U.S. Tax Reform enacted in December 2017. 
Cash and Cash Flows. As of June 30, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $186.4 million, as compared to $222.1 million as of March 31, 2018 and $261.4 million as of as of December 31, 2017. Our cash flows from operating activities for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 were $(3.6) million, which were negatively impacted by an increase in accounts receivable primarily related to the timing around a recurring client payment that was delayed at quarter-end. See the Liquidity section below for further discussion of our cash flows. 
See our 2017 10-K for additional discussion of our business relationships and contractual terms with Comcast, Charter, and DISH. 
The components of total expenses are discussed in more detail below. 
Cost of Revenues. See our 2017 10-K for a description of the types of costs that are included in the individual line items for cost of revenues. 
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. In March 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement (see Note 4 to our Financial Statements). As a result, we incurred a loss of $0.8 million related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. 
The lower effective income tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017 reflects an approximately $5 million net benefit resulting from Comcast’s exercise of 1.4 million vested stock warrants in January 2017, as the stock warrants appreciated in value since their vesting, resulting in an income tax benefit to us when exercised.  
As of June 30, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $186.4 million, as compared to $222.1 million as of March 31, 2018 and $261.4 million as of as of December 31, 2017. We generally invest our excess cash balances in low-risk, short-term investments to limit our exposure to market and credit risks.  
During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement primarily to extend the term of the loan from February 2020 to March 2023 and obtain a reduction in the interest rate and other fees. The 2018 Credit Agreement increased our liquidity and capital resources position by approximately $30 million.  
As part of our 2018 Credit Agreement, we have a $200 million senior secured revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in March 2023. As of June 30, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding on the 2018 Revolver. The 2018 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and financial covenants. As of June 30, 2018, and the date of this filing, we believe that we are in compliance with the provisions of the 2018 Credit Agreement.  
We generally have ready access to substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances, but may face limitations on moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions due to currency controls. As of June 30, 2018, we had $2.0 million of cash restricted as to use primarily to collateralize outstanding letters of credit. 
Cash flows from operating activities for the second quarter of 2018 was negatively impacted primarily by the increase in the accounts receivable balance mainly related to the timing of a recurring payment from a significant client that was delayed and received subsequent to quarter-end. 
As a result of the application of ASC 606, $3.5 million of investments in client contracts have been included in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Previous to the adoption of ASC 606, investments in client contracts were included in investing activities. 
Our financing activities typically consist of activities associated with our common stock and our long-term debt.  
Cash Dividends Paid on Common Stock. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Board approved dividend payments totaling $14.2 million and $13.4 million, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we paid dividends of $14.4 million and $13.7 million, respectively (with the additional amounts attributed to dividends for incentive shares paid upon vesting).  
Repurchase of Common Stock. During the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we repurchased 0.3 million shares of our common stock under the guidelines of our Stock Repurchase Program for $11.3 million and $10.5 million, respectively.  
Outside of our Stock Repurchase Program, during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we repurchased from our employees and then cancelled 0.1 million and 0.2 million shares, respectively, of our common stock in each period for $7.0 million and $6.3 million, respectively, in connection with minimum tax withholding requirements resulting from the vesting of restricted common stock under our stock incentive plans. 
Long-term Debt. During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement and as a result, we repaid the outstanding principal balance of $120.0 million and borrowed $150.0 million under the 2018 Credit Agreement, resulting in a net increase of available cash of $30.0 million. As part of the refinancing, we paid $1.5 million of deferred financing costs.  
Long-Term Debt\Revolving Credit Facility. In March 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement and as a result, we repaid the outstanding term loan principal balance of $120.0 million and borrowed $150.0 million, resulting in a net increase in cash of $30 million (the 2018 Credit Agreement). The 2018 Credit Agreement also includes a $200 million revolving loan facility (2018 Revolver). As of June 30, 2018, we had no borrowing outstanding on our 2018 Revolver and had the entire $200 million available to us. Our long-term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 4 to our Financial Statements. 
During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we repurchased 0.3 million shares of our common stock for $11.3 million (weighted-average price of $44.25 per share).  
Our common stock repurchases are discussed in more detail in Note 10 to our Financial Statements. 
Cash Dividends. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Board declared dividends totaling $14.2 million. Going forward, we expect to pay cash dividends each year in March, June, September, and December, with the amount and timing subject to the Board’s approval. 
Acquisitions. In February 2018, we acquired Business Ink, a privately-held multi-channel business communications company based in Austin, Texas for approximately $70 million. The acquisition was funded from currently available cash. Our acquisition of Business Ink is discussed in more detail in Note 5 to our Financial Statements. 
Capital Expenditures. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we spent $26.7 million on capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2018, we had committed to purchase approximately $16 million of equipment.  
Stock Warrants. We have issued Stock Warrants with an exercise price of $26.68 per warrant to Comcast as an incentive for Comcast to convert new customer accounts to ACP. Once vested, Comcast may exercise the Stock Warrants and elect either physical delivery of common shares or net share settlement (cashless exercise). Alternatively, the exercise of the Stock Warrants may be settled with cash based solely on our approval, or if Comcast were to beneficially own or control in excess of 19.99% of the common stock or voting of the Company. As of June 30, 2018, approximately 1.4 million Stock Warrants are outstanding, of which 0.4 million are vested. 
The Stock Warrants are discussed in more detail in Note 10 to our Financial Statements.  
During the next twelve months, there are no scheduled conversion triggers on our 2016 Convertible Notes. As a result, we expect our required debt service cash outlay during the next twelve months for the 2016 Convertible Notes to be limited to interest payments of $9.8 million. 
Our 2018 Credit Agreement mandatory repayments and the cash interest expense (based upon current interest rates) for the next twelve months is $7.5 million, and $6.1 million, respectively. We have the ability to make prepayments on our 2018 Credit Agreement without penalty.  
Our long-term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 4 to our Financial Statements.
