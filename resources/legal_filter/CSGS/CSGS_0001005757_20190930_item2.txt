Impact of New Lease Accounting Pronouncement 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASC 842”), which requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than twelve months on its balance sheet. We adopted the ASU in January of 2019, utilizing the effective date method of transition. While the adoption of this standard resulted in a material gross-up of our Balance Sheet assets and liabilities, it did not have a material impact on our Income Statement or Statement of Cash Flows. 
Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to our Financial Statements for further detail regarding the adoption of ASC 842. 
Transaction fees are primarily comprised of interchange and other payment-related fees that we pay, in conjunction with the delivery of service to clients under our payment services contracts, to third-party payment processors and financial institutions. Because we control the integrated service provided under our payment services client contracts, these transaction fees are presented gross, and not netted against revenues. 
Stock-based compensation included in the table above excludes amounts that have been recorded in restructuring and reorganization charges. 
Revenues. Revenues for the third quarter of 2019 were $251.4 million, an 18% increase when compared to revenues of $213.1 million for the third quarter of 2018, with the increase mainly attributed to the additional revenues generated from the acquisition of Forte on October 1, 2018, and the continued growth in our cloud solutions and managed service arrangements. 
Operating Results. Operating income for the third quarter of 2019 was $33.4 million, or a 13.3% operating margin percentage, compared to $25.7 million, or a 12.0% operating margin percentage for the third quarter of 2018. The increase in operating income is primarily a result of higher revenues generated in the third quarter of 2019.  
Cash and Cash Flows. As of September 30, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $172.0 million, as compared to $131.5 million as of June 30, 2019 and $162.9 million as of December 31, 2018. Our cash flows from operating activities for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 were $79.1 million. See the Liquidity section below for further discussion of our cash flows. 
Client Concentration. A large percentage of our historical revenues have been generated from our two largest clients, which are Comcast and Charter Corporation Inc. (“Charter”). 
See our 2018 10-K for additional discussion of our business relationships and contractual terms with Comcast and Charter. 
Comcast. In November 2018, Comcast exercised the first of their two one-year renewal options extending the term of their agreement through June 30, 2020. Terms of the extension remain consistent with the financial terms and obligations under the existing agreement. Additionally, under the terms of the agreement, Comcast has the right to exercise an additional one-year renewal option no later than January 1, 2020, to extend the term of the Agreement through June 30, 2021.  
A copy of the Comcast agreement and related amendments, with confidential information redacted, is included in the exhibits to our periodic filings with the SEC.  
Critical Accounting Policies  
We continue to transition our focus towards more predictable recurring revenues models with our managed services arrangements and delivery of our cloud-based solutions and away from large transactional software and services deals with related maintenance agreements. 
The components of total expenses are discussed in more detail below. 
Cost of Revenues. See our 2018 10-K for a description of the types of costs that are included in the individual line items for cost of revenues. 
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. In March 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement, and as a result, we incurred a loss of $0.8 million related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. 
 Liquidity  
Cash and Liquidity 
As of September 30, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $172.0 million, as compared to $131.5 million as of June 30, 2019 and $162.9 million as of December 31, 2018. We generally invest our excess cash balances in low-risk, short-term investments to limit our exposure to market and credit risks.  
As part of our 2018 Credit Agreement, we have a $200 million senior secured revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in March 2023. As of September 30, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding on the 2018 Revolver. The 2018 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and financial covenants. As of September 30, 2019, and the date of this filing, we believe that we are in compliance with the provisions of the 2018 Credit Agreement.  
We generally have ready access to substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances, but may face limitations on moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions due to currency controls. As of September 30, 2019, we had $2.8 million of cash restricted as to use primarily to collateralize outstanding letters of credit. 
Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 reflect the negative impacts of the payment of the 2018 and 2017 year-end accrued employee incentive compensation in the first quarter subsequent to the year-end accrual for these items. Additionally, cash flows from operating activities for the first and second quarters of 2019, and the second quarter of 2018, were negatively impacted by the timing around certain recurring client payments that were received subsequent to quarter-end. 
Billed Trade Accounts Receivable  
As of September 30, 2019, nearly 95% of our billed accounts receivable balance was less than 60 days past due. 
Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
Repurchase of Common Stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, we repurchased approximately 485,000 and 395,000 shares of our common stock, respectively, under the guidelines of our Stock Repurchase Program for $20.6 million and $16.9 million, respectively, and paid $21.0 million and $16.8 million, respectively, through September 30, 2019 and 2018 (with the differences attributed to the timing of share settlement ).  
Long-term Debt.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, we made principal repayments of $5.6 million and $3.8 million respectively.  
During the first quarter of 2018, we refinanced our 2015 Credit Agreement and as a result, we repaid the outstanding principal balance of $120.0 million and borrowed $150.0 million under the 2018 Credit Agreement, resulting in a net increase of available cash of $30.0 million. As part of the refinancing, we paid $1.5 million of deferred financing costs.  
Operating Cash Flows. As described in the Liquidity section above, we believe we have the ability to generate strong cash flows to fund our operating activities and act as a source of funds for our capital resource needs.  
Revolving Credit Facility. We currently have a $200 million revolving loan facility, our 2018 Revolver. As of September 30, 2019, we had no borrowing outstanding on our 2018 Revolver and had the entire $200 million available to us. Our long-term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 4 to our Financial Statements. 
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of our common stock for $20.6 million (weighted-average price of $42.37 per share).  
Cash Dividends. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Board declared dividends totaling $22.0 million. Going forward, we expect to pay cash dividends each year in March, June, September, and December, with the amount and timing subject to the Board’s approval. 
Acquisition. On October 1, 2018, we acquired Forte, a leading provider of advanced payment solutions headquartered in Allen, Texas for a purchase price of approximately $93 million, (approximately $85 million, excluding cash acquired), and held back approximately $13 million in cash subject to certain tax filings, which was paid in July 2019. The purchase agreement includes provisions for $18.8 million of potential future earn-out payments over a four-year measurement period. The earn-out payments are tied to performance-based goals and continued employment by the eligible recipients. As of September 30, 2019, we have made no earn-out payments. 
Equity Method Investment. In the first quarter of 2019, we made an additional $4 million investment in a payment technology and services company that enables omni-channel digital payments in Latin America. As of September 30, 2019, we held an 8% noncontrolling interest with a carrying value of $6.6 million. 
Capital Expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we spent $27.7 million on capital expenditures. As of September 30, 2019, we have made no significant capital expenditure commitments.  
The Stock Warrants are discussed in more detail in Note 8 to our Financial Statements.  
During the next twelve months, there are no scheduled conversion triggers on our 2016 Convertible Notes. As a result, we expect our required debt service cash outlay during the next twelve months for the 2016 Convertible Notes to be limited to interest payments of $9.8 million. 
Our 2018 Credit Agreement mandatory repayments and the cash interest expense (based upon current interest rates) for the next twelve months is $9.4 million, and $5.4 million, respectively. We have the ability to make prepayments on our 2018 Credit Agreement without penalty.
