Overview



CDW Corporation is a Fortune 500 company and a leading provider of integrated information technology ("IT") solutions to small, medium and large business, and government, education and healthcare customers in the US, the UK and Canada.
Our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated IT solutions such as mobility, security, data center optimization, cloud computing, virtualization and collaboration.
We are technology "agnostic," with a broad portfolio including more than 100,000 products and services from more than 1,000 leading and emerging brands.
Our solutions are delivered in physical, virtual and cloud-based environments through over 6,000 customer-facing coworkers, including sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers.
We are a leading sales channel partner for many original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), software publishers and cloud providers (collectively, our "vendor partners"), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer.
We provide our vendor partners with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage, technical expertise and extensive customer access.
Our Corporate segment primarily serves US private sector business customers with more than 250 employees.
Our Small Business segment primarily serves US private sector business customers with up to 250 employees.
Our Public segment is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the US.
We also have two other operating segments: CDW UK and CDW Canada, each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category ("Other").
We may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer.
Each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements.
We also resell software for major software publishers.
Our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services.
In addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals.
A significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses are reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners.
This is particularly the case for our Corporate and Small Business customers, as their purchases tend to reflect confidence in their business prospects, which are driven by their discrete perceptions of business and general economic conditions.
There continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of the UK's planned withdrawal from the European Union ("EU") (referred to as "Brexit").
We have established a presence on the continent to support CDW UK's broader growth opportunities in the EU.
This also serves as a contingency plan to address future developments as needed around Brexit.

•Changes in spending policies, budget priorities and funding levels are a key factor influencing the purchasing levels of government, healthcare and education customers.
•Technology trends drive customer purchasing behaviors in the market.
These trends are driving customer adoption of solutions such as those delivered via cloud, software defined architectures and hybrid on-premise and off-premise combinations, as well as the evolution of the IT consumption model to more "as-a-service" offerings, including Device-as-a-Service ("DaaS") and managed services.
Effective January 1, 2019, we made a change to the Non-GAAP financial measures that we use to provide meaningful methods of evaluating our financial performance and have replaced EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin with Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP operating income margin.
We made this change due to the continuing evolution of the IT consumption model.
Non-GAAP operating income is also being used for the first time in 2019 as a key business metric for our annual incentive compensation programs.
In addition to Non-GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP operating income margin, we believe that the most important financial and non-financial measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per diluted share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, free cash flow, return on working capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable and certain receivables due from vendors plus days of supply in Merchandise inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable and Accounts payable-inventory financing, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit, sales per coworker and coworker turnover.
These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.
Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business.
For the definitions of Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes and Non-GAAP net income and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see "Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations."

Net sales



Net sales by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of total Net sales, and the year-over-year dollar and percentage change in Net sales are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Total Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased $444 million, or 10.6%, to $4,630 million, compared to $4,186 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018.

See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations" below for additional information regarding constant currency Net sales growth.
For additional details, see Note 12 (Segment Information) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Corporate segment Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased $150 million, or 8.7%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Growth was primarily driven by client devices and NetComm.
Small Business segment Net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased by $48 million, or 14.5%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018.
Growth was primarily driven by client devices.

Net sales to Healthcare customers increased 13.6% primarily driven by client devices.
Net sales in Education increased 8.7% primarily driven by video, client devices and NetComm.
The increase in Other was driven by Canada, which includes Scalar.
This increase was partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange of approximately 540 basis points, due to the unfavorable impact resulting from the British pound and Canadian dollar to US dollar translations.
Gross profit



Gross profit increased $78 million, or 11.2%, to $774 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $696 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 16.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2019.

37

Selling and administrative expenses



Selling and administrative expenses increased $39 million, or 10.2%, to $420 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $381 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
The increase was driven by higher payroll expenses due to increased coworkers and higher sales payroll expenses, including sales commissions, which are primarily driven by higher gross profit, the inclusion of Scalar expenses, and performance-based compensation consistent with higher attainment against goals.
Total coworker count was 9,783, up 866 from 8,917 at June 30, 2018, including the incremental headcount from Scalar.
Total coworker count was 9,019 at December 31, 2018.
As a percentage of total Net sales, Selling and administrative expenses remained flat at 9.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2019.
Operating income



During the first quarter of 2019, we evaluated our methodology for allocating certain depreciation and amortization expenses to each of our segments.
The evaluation resulted in a revision to the allocation of depreciation and amortization expenses from Headquarters to our reportable segments, effective January 1, 2019.
The prior period results have been recast to reflect these changes and present comparable information.
(2)Includes the financial results for our other operating segments, CDW UK and CDW Canada, which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds.
(3)Includes certain Headquarters' function costs that are not allocated to the segments.

Other operating margin percentage decreased 90 basis points to 3.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2019, from 4.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2018.
This decrease was primarily driven by higher payroll expenses partially offset by lower intangible asset amortization as a percentage of Net sales.
Income tax expense



Income tax expense was $65 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, compared to $57 million for the same period of the prior year.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations



We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income and Net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 below.
Non-GAAP operating income margin is defined as Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of Net sales.
Net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.
Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
Management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business.

Cash Flows



Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Operating Activities



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Includes items such as deferred income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and equity-based compensation expense.
(3)The change in Accounts receivable is primarily due to improved collections.
47

(4)The change in Merchandise inventory is due to higher customer-driven and strategic stocking positions.
(6)The change in Other is primarily driven by an increase in the receivables from vendors due to the growth in business and lower accrued compensation expense in 2019.
Components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of Accounts receivable, net at the end of the period, divided by average daily Net sales for the same three-month period.
Also incorporates components of other miscellaneous receivables.
(2)Represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of Merchandise inventory at the end of the period divided by average daily Cost of sales for the same three-month period.
(3)Represents the rolling three-month average of the combined balance of Accounts payable-trade, excluding cash overdrafts, and Accounts payable-inventory financing at the end of the period divided by average daily Cost of sales for the same three-month period.
The cash conversion cycle decreased to 16 days at June 30, 2019, compared to 17 days at June 30, 2018.
DSO, DIO and DPO increased 2, 1 and 4 days, respectively, compared to June 30, 2018.
The increase in DSO was primarily driven by higher Net sales and third-party services such as software as a service and warranties.
These sales have an unfavorable impact on DSO as the receivable is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the Consolidated Statement of Operations is recorded on a net basis.
In addition to the impact of these services on DPO, DPO also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms.
Additionally, DIO increased due to higher customer-driven and strategic stocking positions.
Investing Activities



Net cash used in investing activities increased by $85 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period of the prior year.
The increase was primarily due to the completion of our acquisition of Scalar on February 1, 2019.
Additionally, Capital expenditures were $44 million and $34 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to the timing of investments for improvements to our information technology systems.
Financing Activities



Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $33 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period of the prior year.
The decrease was primarily driven by further leveraging our inventory financing arrangements and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, which were partially offset by our share repurchases and increasing our dividends per share during the six months ended June 30, 2019.
Contractual Obligations



There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
