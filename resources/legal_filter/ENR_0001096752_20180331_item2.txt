Item 2.
(in millions, except per share data, unaudited)



The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on November 20, 2017.
While we report financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("reported" or "GAAP"), this discussion also includes Non-GAAP measures.
These Non-GAAP measures are referred to as "adjusted" or "organic" and exclude items such as the disposition of the Playtex gloves business, the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Jack Black, L.L.C.
("Jack Black"), restructuring charges and amortization of intangibles.
This Non-GAAP information is provided as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
We use this Non-GAAP information internally to make operating decisions and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of ongoing operating results.
This Non-GAAP information is a component in determining management's incentive compensation.
Finally, we believe this information provides a higher degree of transparency.
The following provides additional detail on our Non-GAAP measures:



•We analyze our net sales and segment profit on an organic basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods.
For the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, the impact of acquisitions includes net sales and segment profit activity for Jack Black, which was acquired in March 2018.
For the six months ended March 31, 2018, the impact of acquisitions also includes October 2017 net sales and segment profit for Bulldog Skincare Holdings Limited (“Bulldog”), which was acquired in October 2016.
•Adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share are defined as net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding items such as Jack Black integration costs, restructuring charges, the gain on the disposition of the gloves business, the related tax effects of these items and the impact of the Tax Act.
•Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flows less any capital expenditures in current year.
All comparisons are with the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise noted.
Industry and Market Data.
Unless we indicate otherwise, we base the information concerning our industry contained or incorporated by reference herein on our general knowledge of and expectations concerning the industry.
We have not independently verified data from industry analyses and cannot guarantee accuracy or completeness.
Retail sales for purposes of market size, market position and market share information are based on retail sales in United States ("U.S.") dollars.

Overview



Edgewell Personal Care Company, and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Edgewell"), is one of the world's largest manufacturers and marketers of personal care products in the wet shave, sun and skin care, feminine care and infant care categories.
We conduct our business in the following four segments:



•Wet Shave consists of products sold under the Schick®, Wilkinson Sword®, Edge®, Skintimate®, Shave Guard and Personna® brands, as well as non-branded products.
Our wet shave products include razor handles and refillable blades, disposable shave products and shaving gels and creams.
•Sun and Skin Care consists of Banana Boat® and Hawaiian Tropic® sun care products, Bulldog® and Jack Black® men's skin care products, Wet Ones® wipes and Playtex® household gloves until the sale of the gloves business in October 2017.
Refer to Note 2 of our Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the acquisition of Jack Black and Note 3 of our Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the sale of the Playtex household gloves business.
•Feminine Care includes tampons, pads and liners sold under the Playtex Gentle Glide® and Sport®, Stayfree®, Carefree® and o.b.® brands.
•All Other includes infant care products, such as bottles, cups and pacifiers, under the Playtex®, OrthoPro® and Binky® brand names, as well as the Diaper Genie® and Litter Genie® disposal systems.
The personal care product categories are highly competitive, both in the U.S. and on a global basis, as large manufacturers with global operations compete for consumer acceptance and, increasingly, limited retail shelf space.
Competition is based upon brand perception, product performance, customer service and price.
Our priority is to deliver our strategic objectives, focusing on maximizing sales and profit growth through innovation, product line extensions and share gains, and we continue to target improved working capital management as a key business objective.
Significant Events



Acquisitions



On March 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Jack Black, a leading U.S. based luxury men's skincare products company based in the United States, for approximately $90.3, net of cash acquired.
The acquisition will create opportunities to expand our personal care portfolio in growing categories in the U.S. and globally, while nurturing the brand equity of Jack Black.
The results of Jack Black for the post-acquisition period are included within the Company's results for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018.

On October 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Bulldog, a men's grooming and skincare products company based in the United Kingdom for $34.0, net of cash acquired.
The acquisition created opportunities to expand our personal care portfolio into a growing global category where we can leverage our international geographic footprint.
The acquisition was financed through available foreign cash.
The results of Bulldog for the post-acquisition period are included within our results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 and 2017.
Project Fuel



In February 2018, we launched Project Fuel, an enterprise-wide transformational initiative designed to address all aspects of our business and cost structure.
The project will incorporate our existing ZBS and global productivity initiatives and will include a new global restructuring initiative.
While we are incurring costs for Project Fuel beginning in fiscal 2018, the majority of costs and savings under Project Fuel are expected to take place during fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2021.
In addition to the expected cost savings and improved profitability, Project Fuel is designed to strengthen our challenger culture and reinforce our consumer-centric organizational focus.
It is also designed to simplify the organization and streamline ways of working in order to increase competitiveness, speed and agility, and ensure we have the skills, capabilities and investments needed to compete in a rapidly changing world.
For further information on our restructuring projects, see Note 4 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sale of Playtex Gloves Business



We completed the sale the Playtex® gloves business to a household products company for $19.0 on October 26, 2017.
The sale allows us to better focus and utilize resources on other product lines.
Total assets sold were approximately $3.1 resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $15.9.

Operating Results 



The following table presents changes in net sales for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, as compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal 2017, and provides a reconciliation of organic net sales to reported amounts.
Net Sales



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, net sales were $608.1, a 0.5% decrease when compared with the prior year period.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the Playtex gloves sale and currency movements, organic net sales decreased 3.4% versus the prior year period.
From a geographic perspective, organic net sales in North America declined 7%, while increasing 4% in total International markets.
Volumes were lower in North America Wet Shave, Infant Care and Feminine Care, offset in part by higher volumes in global Sun and Skin Care and International Wet Shave.
Price mix was unfavorable in the quarter due to higher Sun Care returns and an increase in Wet Shave promotional spend in North America.
For the first six months of fiscal 2018, net sales decreased 1.8%.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the Playtex gloves sale and currency movements, organic net sales decreased 4.2% versus the prior year period.
From a geographic perspective, organic net sales in North America declined 7%, while increasing 1% in total International markets.
The decline in organic net sales was primarily due to declines in Wet Shave, primarily in North America, driven by competitive pressure and category declines and Feminine Care volume declines, partially offset by growth in Skin Care in Bulldog and Wet Ones.
For further discussion regarding net sales, including a summary of reported versus organic changes, see "Segment Results."
Gross Profit 



Gross profit was $302.1 during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to $309.6 in the prior year period.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 49.7%, representing a 100 basis point decline over the prior year gross margin of 50.7%, primarily driven by unfavorable price mix due to increased Sun Care returns and higher promotional activity in support of new Wet Shave products.
Volume mix negatively impacted margin by 10 basis points, while cost mix had a 30 basis point negative impact, largely driven by unfavorable transactional currency.
Gross profit was $502.4 during the first six months of fiscal 2018, as compared to $537.6 in the prior year period.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was 46.7%, down 240 basis points as compared to the prior year period.
The decline was primarily driven by lower sales volumes in Wet Shave and Feminine Care, unfavorable price mix from Wet Shave promotions and Sun Care returns and higher product costs, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense



SG&A was $103.5 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, or 17.0% of net sales, as compared to $103.9 in the prior year period, or 17.0% of net sales.
Excluding $2.6 of acquisition and integration costs associated with Jack Black and unfavorable currency translation, SG&A as a percent of net sales improved 50 basis points over the prior year.
34



SG&A was $200.7 in the first six months of fiscal 2018, or 18.6% of net sales, as compared to $197.7 in the prior year period, or 18.0% of net sales.
The increase in the current year period was primarily related to the $2.6 of acquisition and integration costs associated with Jack Black.
Excluding the $2.6 million of acquisition and integration costs associated with Jack Black, SG&A as a percent of net sales increased 40 basis points over the prior year.
Advertising and Sales Promotion Expense



For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, A&P was $75.6, down $6.9 as compared to the prior year period.

A&P spending as a percent of net sales was 11.6%, as compared to 12.1% in the prior year period.
The decrease was driven by higher prior year spend in Wet Shave in support of new product innovation in men's Hydro® in North America, lower Feminine Care spend compared to the prior year period and an $8.5 million reduction in spend generated by our ZBS initiative to centralize creative asset development for our global brands.
Research and Development Expense



R&D for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $15.5, compared to spending of $17.5 in the prior year period.
As a percent of sales, R&D declined 40 basis points to 2.5% in the current quarter from 2.9% in the prior year period.

Interest expense associated with debt for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $18.2, an increase from the prior year period expense of $17.3.
For the first six months of fiscal 2018, interest expense was $36.0 compared to $34.7 in the prior year period.
The increase in interest expense primarily relates to increased interest rates for variable rate debt.
Other (Income) Expense, Net



Other (income) expense, net was income of $0.2 during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to income of $6.6 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Other (income) expense, net was expense of $2.8 during the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared to income of $8.5 during first six months of fiscal 2017.
The current year periods reflect the negative impact of foreign currency exchange contract gains and losses and the revaluation of nonfunctional currency balance sheet exposures.
Income Tax Provision



The effective tax rate for the second quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017 was 24.1% and 26.6%, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2018 and 2017 was 39.7% and 26.2%, respectively.
Excluding the gain on the sale of the Playtex gloves business, net tax expense from the Tax Act, costs related to the acquisition and integration of Jack Black and restructuring charges, the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.8% and 26.6% for the first six months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1)Includes adjustments for the impact of the Tax Act, the gain on sale of the Playtex gloves business, Jack Black acquisition and integration charges and restructuring charges.
See reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings.
Savings Initiatives



Our ZBS initiative was established to capture savings and establish cost-conscious spending policies consistent with our strategic needs.
Net cost savings from our ZBS initiative are anticipated to be between $25 to $30 in fiscal 2018, which will be reinvested into marketing spend and our strategic growth initiatives.
In February 2018, we launched Project Fuel, an enterprise-wide transformational initiative designed to address all aspects of our business and cost structure.
The project will incorporate our existing ZBS and global productivity initiatives and will include a new global restructuring initiative.
While we are incurring costs for Project Fuel beginning in fiscal 2018, the majority of costs and savings under Project Fuel are expected to take place during fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2021.
Project Fuel is expected to achieve an estimated $225 million in total gross savings through the end of the 2021 fiscal year.
These savings initiatives will materially affect Supply Chain, Operations, Commercial and Sales Organizations, and Corporate G&A, and will affect all business Segments.
It is expected that the savings generated will be used to fuel investments in strategic growth initiatives and brands, offset operational headwinds from inflation and other input costs, and improve our overall profitability.
In the second quarter, Project Fuel costs totaled $3.7 related to severance and consulting charges.
For fiscal year 2018, Project Fuel related restructuring charges and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $40 and $16, respectively.
We estimate one-time pre-tax charges related to Project Fuel to be approximately $120 to $130 million, with an additional capital investment of $60 to $70 million through the end of the 2021 fiscal year to implement the restructuring element of Project Fuel.
We anticipate that the majority of the one-time charges associated with these initiatives will be incurred by the end of the 2019 fiscal year.
Segment Results



Segment performance is evaluated based on segment profit, exclusive of general corporate expenses, share-based compensation costs, costs associated with restructuring initiatives and the amortization of intangible assets.
Financial items, such as interest income and expense, are managed on a global basis at the corporate level.
The exclusion of such charges from segment results reflects management's view on how it evaluates segment performance.
Our operating model includes some shared business functions across the segments, including product warehousing and distribution, transaction processing functions and, in most cases, a combined sales force and management teams.
We apply a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between the segments.
Such allocations are estimates, and do not represent the costs of such services if performed on a stand-alone basis.
The following tables present changes in segment net sales and segment profit for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, as compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal 2017, and provide a reconciliation of organic segment net sales and organic segment profit to reported amounts.
For a reconciliation of segment profit to Earnings before income taxes, see Note 16 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources



We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed.
We generally repatriate a portion of current year earnings from select non-US subsidiaries only if the economic cost of the repatriation is not considered material.
We utilized repatriated cash to invest in Jack Black and to reduce borrowings under the U.S. revolving credit facility.
The counterparties to deposits consist of a number of major financial institutions.
We consistently monitor positions with, and credit ratings of, counterparties both internally and by using outside ratings agencies.
Our total borrowings were $1,425.7 at March 31, 2018, including $307.8 tied to variable interest rates.
Our total borrowings at September 30, 2017 were $1,544.8.
As of March 31, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings of $123.0 under our unsecured revolving credit facility in the U.S. (the "Revolving Facility") and $8.0 of outstanding letters of credit.
Taking into account outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit at March 31, 2018, $594.0 remains available under the Revolving Facility.
At September 30, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings of $245.0 under the Revolving Facility.
As of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, we had approximately $185.0 outstanding under a term loan.
We had outstanding international borrowings, recorded in Notes payable, of $21.6 and $19.4 as of March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
The minimum required contribution to our pension plans in fiscal 2018 is $9.6; however, discretionary contributions may also be made.
During the first six months of fiscal 2018, we contributed $3.9 to our pension plans.
As of March 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with our debt agreements.
Cash Flows



A summary of our cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities is provided in the following table:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



41



Operating Activities



Cash flow from operating activities was $73.4 during the first six months of fiscal 2018, as compared to $15.1 during the same period in the prior year.
The improvement in operating cash flow was driven by changes in working capital, primarily in accounts receivable, inventory and other operating liabilities.
The Company expects that fiscal 2018 free cash flow will be above 100% of GAAP net earnings.
Investing Activities



Cash flow used by investing activities was $94.2 during the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to $58.5 during the same period in the prior year.
The change was primarily due to the $90.3 acquisition of Jack Black in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, slightly offset by the $19.0 sale of the Playtex gloves business in the first quarter fiscal 2018.
In the prior year we purchased Bulldog for $34.0.
Capital expenditures were $27.6 during the first six months of fiscal 2018 and $30.4 during the same period in the prior year.
Financing Activities



Net cash used by financing activities was $249.7 during the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to net cash from financing activities of $282.8 during the same period in the prior year.
The $33.1 decrease in net cash used by financing activities was driven by smaller net repayments related to the Revolving Facility in the current year compared to the repayment of our former Netherlands credit facility for approximately $277.0 in fiscal 2017.
The decline in net debt repayments was offset by an increase in repurchases of common shares of $65.9 in the six months ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the prior year period.
Share Repurchases



During the first six months of fiscal 2018, we repurchased 2.1 shares of our common stock for $124.4.
In January 2018, the Board approved an authorization to repurchase up to 10.0 shares of the Company's common stock, replacing the previous stock repurchase authorization from May 2015.
Commitments and Contingencies



Contractual Obligations



During the first six months of fiscal 2018, our net repayments on our revolving credit facilities were $122.0.
As of March 31, 2018, future repayments of debt are as follows: $185.0 in fiscal 2019, $123.0 in fiscal 2020, $600.0 in fiscal 2021 and $500.0 in fiscal 2022.
There have been no other material changes in our contractual obligations since the presentation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on November 20, 2017.
Environmental Matters



Our operations, like those of other companies, are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations intended to protect the public health and the environment.
These regulations relate primarily to worker safety, air and water quality, underground fuel storage tanks and waste handling and disposal.
It is difficult to quantify with certainty the cost of environmental matters, particularly remediation and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment.
Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact, and may proceed for protracted periods of time.
The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty.
We review our legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions.
We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated.
