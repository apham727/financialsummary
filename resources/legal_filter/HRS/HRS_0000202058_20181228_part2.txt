Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
Merger Litigation. As described in Note R — Legal Proceedings and Contingencies in the Notes, in connection with our pending merger with L3 (see Note S — Pending Merger in the Notes for additional information), two putative class action lawsuits and one individual lawsuit were filed against the L3 Parties in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York between December 19, 2018 and January 15, 2019, and a third putative class action lawsuit, Kent v. L3 Technologies, Inc., et al., was filed against the L3 Parties and the Harris Parties in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 4, 2019. The complaints in the lawsuits contain substantially similar allegations contending, among other things, that the registration statement on Form S-4 in support of the pending merger misstates or fails to disclose certain allegedly material information in violation of federal securities laws. The complaint in the Kent lawsuit further alleges that the Harris Parties are liable for these violations as “controlling persons” of L3 within the meaning of federal securities laws. The complaints in all four lawsuits generally seek injunctive relief enjoining the merger, damages and costs, among other remedies. Additional lawsuits in connection with the merger may be filed in the future. Although the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty, and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may cause the merger to be delayed or not to be completed, which could cause us not to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger, we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against them and any other lawsuits challenging the pending merger. Therefore, at this time, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on us or the merger. 
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
•The market price for shares of common stock of the combined company following the completion of the merger may be affected by factors different from, or in addition to, those that historically have affected or currently affect the market prices of shares of our common stock and L3 common stock.
•The shares of common stock of the combined company to be received by L3 stockholders as a result of the merger will have rights different from the shares of L3 common stock.
•Our stockholders and L3 stockholders will each have reduced ownership and voting interest in and will exercise less influence over management of the combined company.
•Until the completion of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, we and L3 are each prohibited from entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or L3 and our respective stockholders.
•Obtaining required approvals and satisfying closing conditions may prevent or delay completion of the merger.
•The merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be consummated.
•The termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact us or L3.

•We and L3 each will incur significant transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs in connection with the merger.
•Our stockholders and L3 stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in the merger.
•Litigation filed against the L3 Parties and the Harris Parties could prevent or delay the consummation of the merger or result in the payment of damages following completion of the merger.
•The combined company may not be able to retain customers or suppliers or customers or suppliers may seek to modify contractual obligations with the combined company, which could have an adverse effect on the combined company’s business and operations.
•The combined company may be exposed to increased litigation, which could have an adverse effect on the combined company’s business and operations.
•Third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships with us or L3.
•The combined company may be unable to retain our and L3 personnel successfully after the merger is completed.

These risks are discussed more fully in the registration statement on Form S-4 we filed with the SEC on December 14, 2018 that includes our and L3’s joint proxy statement that also constitutes our prospectus. Although the registration statement has not yet been declared effective, we urge you to read it and any amendments and supplements thereto, because they contain important information about the pending merger, including relevant risk factors.
