NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



(Unaudited)



Note 1.Basis of Presentation



The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, and should be read in conjunction with the Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx or the Company) consolidated financial statements filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
The interim financial statements are unaudited, but reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, of a normal, recurring nature necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented.
The Company uses a 52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31.
Fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 are both 52-week years ending on March 30, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively.
The quarters ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017 each consisted of 13 weeks.
The authoritative guidance provides a five-step process for recognizing revenue that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled, in exchange for those goods or services.
The new guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (Full Retrospective), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application.
The Company adopted the new guidance on April 1, 2018, using the Full Retrospective method and restated the comparative prior periods.
The Company implemented internal controls and certain system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption.
Previously, revenue was recognized upon reported resale of the product by the distributors to their customers (sell-through) as reduced by actual allowances for distributor price adjustments.
Revenue from software license agreements, software license renewals, and other contracts are recognized at point of sales, whereas previously these were deferred and recognized over the contractual term before the implementation of the authoritative guidance.
Revenue recognition related to the Company's other revenue streams, such as direct customers, remains unchanged.
The authoritative guidance does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans.
The authoritative guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.
The Company adopted this authoritative guidance on April 1, 2018 and recorded the balance of the unrealized losses of $11.0 million as of the end of fiscal 2018 from its investment in debt mutual funds and equity securities to retained earnings, less the related deferred taxes of $2.6 million.
Subsequent changes in fair value from such investments are recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of income.
The authoritative guidance is effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and requires the adoption be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.
The Company adopted this authoritative guidance on April 1, 2018.
Accordingly, $13.8 million of prepaid taxes associated with prior period intra-entity asset transfers was reclassified to retained earnings.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted



Leases



In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on leases.
Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation.
The new authoritative guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, which for Xilinx would be the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
Early adoption is permitted.
The new authoritative guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition with application of the new authoritative guidance for leases that existed at or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.
To help with the transition to the new guidance, certain practical expedients are provided.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new authoritative guidance on its condensed consolidated financial statements.
Note 3.Significant Customers and Concentrations of Credit Risk



Avnet, Inc. (Avnet), one of the Company’s distributors, distributes the Company’s products worldwide.
As of June 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, Avnet accounted for 70% and 61% of the Company’s total net accounts receivable, respectively.
Net revenues from Avnet accounted for 51% and 41% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Company expects its accounts receivable to be relatively higher than normal on a temporary basis as the Company partners with its distributors to manage their inventory requirements.
Xilinx is subject to concentrations of credit risk primarily in its trade accounts receivable and investments in debt securities to the extent of the amounts recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
The Company attempts to mitigate the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables through its credit evaluation process, collection terms, distributor sales to diverse end customers and through geographical dispersion of sales.
No end customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018.
The Company mitigates concentrations of credit risk in its investments in debt securities by currently investing approximately 91% of its portfolio in AA (or its equivalent) or higher grade securities as rated by Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s Investors Service.
The Company’s methods to arrive at investment decisions are not solely based on the rating agencies’ credit ratings.
Xilinx also performs additional credit due diligence and conducts regular portfolio credit reviews, including a review of counterparty credit risk related to the Company’s forward currency exchange and interest rate swap contracts.
Additionally, Xilinx limits its investments in the debt securities of a single issuer based upon the issuer’s credit rating and attempts to further mitigate credit risk by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer.
As of June 30, 2018, approximately 24% of the portfolio consisted of mortgage-backed securities.

Note 4.Fair Value Measurements



The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements established by the FASB defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The Company primarily uses a consensus price or weighted-average price for its fair value assessment.
For certain securities with short maturities, such as discount commercial paper and certificates of deposit, the security is accreted from purchase price to face value at maturity.
If a subsequent transaction on the same security is observed in the marketplace, the price on the subsequent transaction is used as the current daily market price and the security will be accreted to face value based on the revised price.
There have not been any changes to the Company’s fair value methodology during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and the Company did not adjust or override any fair value measurements as of June 30, 2018.
Fair Value Hierarchy



The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities.
The Company’s Level 1 assets consist of U.S. government securities, money market funds and marketable equity securities.
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
The Company’s Level 2 assets consist of financial institution securities, non-financial institution securities, U.S. agency securities, foreign government and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, debt mutual funds, asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities.
The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities also include foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts.
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The Company has no Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis



In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.
The following tables present information about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018:



10

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



11

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash held in banks, accounts receivable and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities, and are therefore excluded from the fair value tables above.
As of June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, the Company held no marketable securities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs.
Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis



The Company's $500.0 million principal amount of 2.125% notes due March 15, 2019 (2019 Notes), $500.0 million principal amount of 3.000% notes due March 15, 2021 (2021 Notes) and $750.0 million principal amount of 2.950% senior notes due June 1, 2024 (2024 Notes) are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis for disclosure purposes.
The fair values of the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes as of June 30, 2018 were approximately $498.0 million, $495.9 million and $713.4 million, respectively, based on the last trading price for the period (classified as Level 2 in fair value hierarchy due to relatively low trading volume).
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 



As of June 30, 2018, the Company had non-marketable equity securities in private companies of $49.6 million, which were classified as Level 3 assets.
Substantially all time deposits were issued by institutions outside the U.S. as of June 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018.
The gross unrealized losses that had been outstanding for more than twelve months were primarily related to debt mutual funds and mortgage-backed securities, which were primarily due to the general rising of the interest-rate environment and foreign currency movement.
Starting April 1, 2018, the Company records the change in the fair value of its investment in debt mutual funds and marketable equity securities as part of its interest and other income (expense), net.
This change in fair value was a net decrease of $6.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and resulted in an expense within interest and other income (expense) net for the period.
These investments are highly rated by the credit rating agencies, there have been no defaults on any of these securities and the company has received interest payments as they become due.
Therefore, the Company believes that it will be able to collect both principal and interest amount due to the Company.
Additionally, in the past several years a portion of the Company's investment in the mortgage-backed securities was redeemed or prepaid by the debtors at par.
Furthermore, the aggregate of individual unrealized losses that had been outstanding for twelve months or more was not significant as of June 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018.
The Company neither intends to sell these investments nor concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that it will have to sell them until recovery of their carrying values.
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable debt securities (financial institution securities, non-financial institution securities, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities), by contractual maturity, are shown in the table below.
Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations without call or prepayment penalties.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of June 30, 2018, $1.08 billion of marketable debt securities with contractual maturities of greater than one year were classified as short-term investments.
14

Certain information related to available-for-sale securities is as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The cost of securities matured or sold is based on the specific identification method.
Note 6.Derivative Financial Instruments



The Company’s primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk.
As a result of the use of derivative financial instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts may fail to meet their contractual obligations.
The Company manages counterparty credit risk in derivative contracts by reviewing counterparty creditworthiness on a regular basis, establishing collateral requirement and limiting exposure to any single counterparty.
The right of set-off that exists with certain transactions enables the Company to net amounts due to and from the counterparty, reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty default.
The outstanding forward currency exchange contracts expire at various dates through May 2020.
The net unrealized losses, which approximate the fair market value of the outstanding forward currency exchange contracts, are expected to be realized into net income within the next two years.
As of June 30, 2018, all of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the gain or loss on the forward contracts was reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into net income in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as hedges of anticipated transactions, for which a firm commitment has been attained and the hedged relationship has been effective, are deferred and included in income or expenses in the same period that the underlying transaction is settled.
15

The Company entered into interest rate swap contracts with certain independent financial institutions to manage interest rate risks related to fixed interest rate expenses from its 2024 Notes and floating interest rate income from its investments in marketable debt securities.
See “Note 10.
Debt and Credit Facility” for more discussion related to interest rate swap contracts.
The interest rate swap contracts were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the 2024 Notes, and were separately accounted for as a derivative.
The interest rate swap contracts and the 2024 Notes were initially measured at fair value.
Any subsequent changes in fair values of the interest rate swap contracts and the 2024 Notes will be recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the net change in fair values of the interest rate swap contracts and the underlying 2024 Notes was $7.4 million, which was recorded as a derivative liability for the interest rate swap contacts and also a reduction from the carrying amount of 2024 Notes.
There was no ineffectiveness during all periods presented.
The potential effect of rights of set-off associated with the derivative financial instruments was not material to the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.
Note 7.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans



The Company’s equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term retention programs that cover employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company.
These plans are intended to attract and retain talented employees, consultants and non-employee directors and to provide such persons with a proprietary interest in the Company.
Stock-Based Compensation



The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock awards granted under the Company’s equity incentive plans and rights to acquire stock granted under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP):



16

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Employee Stock Option Plans



The types of awards allowed under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (2007 Equity Plan) include incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), restricted stock and stock appreciation rights.
To date, the Company has issued a mix of non-qualified stock options and RSUs under the 2007 Equity Plan; however, there was no issuance of stock options during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and the entire fiscal 2018.
The Company's stock-based compensation expenses related to options during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and the number of options outstanding as of June 30, 2018 were not material.
As of June 30, 2018, 11.2 million shares remained available for grant under the 2007 Equity Plan.
The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017 was $220 thousand and $2.8 million, respectively.
This intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise.
RSU Awards



A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information is as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



17

The estimated fair values of RSUs were calculated based on the market price of Xilinx common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on Xilinx common stock prior to vesting.
The per share weighted-average fair value of RSUs granted during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was $65.69 ($57.99 for the first quarter of fiscal 2018), which were calculated based on estimates at the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSU awards vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that the Company pays in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of the Company's employees.
During the first three months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, the Company withheld $5.5 million and $25.6 million worth of RSU awards, respectively, to satisfy the employees’ tax obligations.
During the first three months of fiscal 2018, the Company realized tax benefits of $11.6 million.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan



The fair values of stock purchase plan rights under the Company’s ESPP were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Under the Company’s ESPP, shares are only issued during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year.
Therefore, no shares were issued during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 or 2018.
The next scheduled purchase under the ESPP is in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
As of June 30, 2018, 9.3 million shares were available for future issuance under the Company's ESPP.
Note 8.
Net Income Per Common Share



The computation of basic net income per common share for all periods presented is derived from information on the condensed consolidated statements of income, and there are no reconciling items in the numerator used to compute the diluted net income per common share.
The following table summarizes the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The total shares used in the denominator of the diluted net income per common share calculation include potentially dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding that are not included in basic net income per common share calculation.
The diluted shares were calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the impact of the equity incentive plans, the incremental shares issuable assuming conversion of the Company's $600.0 million principal amount of 2.625% convertible notes issued in June 2010 (2017 Convertible Notes), before its maturity on June 15, 2017, and exercise of warrants on a weighted-average outstanding basis, before the final settlements during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
The 2017 Convertible Notes matured during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and the Company exercised its call options to neutralize the dilutive effect of the incremental shares from the 2017 Convertible Notes.
Because the number of diluted shares in the above table for the three months ended July 1, 2017 was calculated based on a weighted-average outstanding basis, it included approximately 6.0 million shares of dilutive impact from the 2017 Convertible Notes through the maturity date.
Such impact will no longer be applicable in future periods.
18

Outstanding stock options and RSUs under the Company's stock award plans to purchase approximately 366 thousand and 152 thousand shares for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, were excluded from the diluted net income per common share calculation by applying the treasury stock method, as their inclusion would have been antidilutive.
These options and RSUs could be dilutive in the future if the Company’s average share price increases and is greater than the combined exercise prices and the unamortized fair values of these options and RSUs.
Note 9.Inventories



Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method), or market (estimated net realizable value) and are comprised of the following:

The Company received $745.2 million from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, after the debt discount and deduction of debt issuance costs.
As of June 30, 2018, the remaining term of the 2024 Notes is approximately 6.0 years.
In relation to the issuance of the 2024 Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts with certain independent financial institutions, whereby the Company pays on a semi-annual basis, a variable interest rate equal to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 91.43 bps, and receives on a semi-annual basis, interest income at a fixed interest rate of 2.950%.
The Company incurred a net interest expense of $851 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and earned a net interest income of $643 thousand for the three months ended July 1, 2017, from the interest rate swap contracts, which was included in interest and other income (expense), net on the condensed consolidated statements of income.
The following table summarizes the carrying value of the 2024 Notes as of June 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018:

Revolving Credit Facility



On December 7, 2016, the Company entered into a $400.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that, upon certain conditions, may be extended by an additional $150.0 million, with a syndicate of banks (expiring in December 2021).
Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a benchmark rate plus an applicable margin based upon the Company’s credit rating.
In connection with the credit facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial and nonfinancial covenants.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company had made no borrowings under this credit facility and was not in violation of any of the covenants.
Note 11.
Common Stock Repurchase Program



The Board of Directors (Board) has approved stock repurchase programs enabling the Company to repurchase its common stock in the open market or through negotiated transactions with independent financial institutions.
On May 16, 2016, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1.00 billion of the Company's common stock and debentures (2016 Repurchase Program).
The 2016 Repurchase Program has no stated expiration date.
On May 16, 2018, the Board authorized the 2018 Repurchase Program to repurchase the Company's common stock and debentures up to $500.0 million.
20

Through June 30, 2018, the Company had used $929.4 million of the $1.00 billion authorized under the 2016 Repurchase Program, leaving $70.6 million available for future repurchases.
The Company’s current policy is to retire all repurchased shares, and consequently, no treasury shares were held as of June 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for a total of $136.8 million and during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company repurchased 1.0 million shares of common stock for a total of $67.1 million.

Note 14.
Income Taxes



The Company recorded a tax provision of $22.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to $13.7 million in the same prior year period, representing effective tax rates of 11% and 8%, respectively.
The prior year balance has been restated to reflect the retrospective application of the current authoritative guidance for revenue recognition.
Please refer to "Note 2.
Recent Accounting Changes and Accounting Pronouncements" for additional detail.
In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, the Company has recorded provisional amounts recognizing the effect of the tax law changes in prior periods, but may adjust those provisional amounts during a measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company has not adjusted the provisional estimate recorded in prior periods for effects from the one-time transition tax.
The Company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2018, determined in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance for measuring uncertain tax positions, increased by $825 thousand in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to $126.0 million.
Another $85.5 million would increase additional paid-in capital.
The $85.5 million relates to an additional deduction claimed on federal and state amended tax returns for fiscal 2014 for repurchase premium paid in that year in connection with the early redemption of the Company’s 3.125% Junior Convertible debenture due March 15, 2037.

Commitments



Xilinx leases some of its facilities and office buildings under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through April 2029.
Additionally, Xilinx entered into a land lease in conjunction with the Company’s building in Singapore, which will expire in November 2035 and the lease cost was settled in an up-front payment in June 2006.
Some of the operating leases for facilities and office buildings require payment of operating costs, including property taxes, repairs, maintenance and insurance.
Most of the Company’s leases contain renewal options for varying terms.
Xilinx also leases cars under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through May 2022.
Approximate future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Aggregate future rental income to be received, which includes rents from both owned and leased property, totaled $12.0 million as of June 30, 2018.
Rent expense, net of rental income, under all operating leases was $1.0 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, respectively.
Rental income was not material for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 or 2018.
Other commitments as of June 30, 2018 totaled $136.5 million and consisted of purchases of inventory and other non-cancelable purchase obligations related to subcontractors that manufacture silicon wafers and provide assembly and some test services.
The Company expects to receive and pay for these materials and services in the next three to six months, as the products meet delivery and quality specifications.
Additionally, as of June 30, 2018, the Company also had $18.9 million of non-cancelable license obligations to providers of electronic design automation software and hardware/software maintenance and $33.7 million commitments primarily related to open purchase orders from ordinary operations.

Product Warranty and Indemnification



The Company generally sells products with a limited warranty for product quality.
As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and the end of fiscal 2018, the accrual balances of the product warranty liability were immaterial.
The terms and conditions of these indemnity obligations are limited by contract, which obligations are typically perpetual from the effective date of the agreement.
The Company has historically received only a limited number of requests for indemnification under these provisions and has not made any significant payments pursuant to these provisions.
