Earnings Per Share of Common Stock



Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.

New accounting standards not adopted as of June 30, 2018 



In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.
The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective.
The new standard is effective for the Company on October 1, 2018, and it does not plan to early adopt this ASU.
The standard outlines a five-step model whereby revenue is recognized as performance obligations within a contract are satisfied.
The standard also requires new, expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition.
The Company has selected the modified retrospective approach as its transition method.
Because the new standard will impact our business processes, systems and controls, we are developing a comprehensive change management project plan to guide the implementation.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, except for inventory measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method.
This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and requires prospective application, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
This ASU requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for most lease arrangements.
The new standard is effective for the Company on October 1, 2019.
The standard mandates a modified retrospective transition method for all entities and early adoption is permitted.
The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-08 (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) to clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.
The amendments in this update provides additional guidance on indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer and does not change the core principle of previously issued guidance.
The amendments in this Topic are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
This ASU will reduce diversity in practice for classifying cash payments and receipts in the statement of cash flows for a number of common transactions.
It will also clarify when identifiable cash flows should be separated versus classified based on their predominant source or use.
This ASU is effective for public 



14



business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.
If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.
An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.
This ASU requires the seller and buyer to recognize at the transaction date the current and deferred income tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers (except transfers of inventory).
Under current GAAP, the seller and buyer defer the consolidated tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer from the period of the transfer to a future period when the asset is transferred out of the consolidated group, or otherwise affects consolidated earnings.
For public entities, the new standard is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
An entity may early adopt the standard but only at the beginning of an annual period for which it has not issued or made available for issuance financial statements (interim or annual).
In January 2017, FASB issued ASU No.
2017-01, “Business Combinations Clarifying the Definition of a Business" (Topic 805) (“ASU No.
2017-01”).
ASU 2017-01 provides a framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business.

Additionally, only the service cost component of net periodic pension cost will be eligible for asset capitalization.
For public entities, the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that annual period.
Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made available for issuance.
This ASU should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the income statement and prospectively, on and after the effective date, for the capitalization of the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit in assets.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is permitted.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which works to improve on certain aspects of ASU No.

Under that transition method, an entity initially applies this ASU at the beginning of the earliest period presented in its financial statements.
ASU No.
2018-11 provides another adoption method, which allows entities to initially apply ASU No.
2016-02 at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption.
