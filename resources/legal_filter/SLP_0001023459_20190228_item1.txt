(Unaudited) 



NOTE 1: GENERAL 



This report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended February 28, 2019 should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on November 14, 2018.
As contemplated by the SEC under Article 8 of Regulation S-X, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been condensed and therefore do not contain all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles.
The interim financial data are unaudited; however, in the opinion of Simulations Plus, Inc. ("we", "our", "us"), the interim data includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.
Results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those to be expected for the full year.
Organization

Revenue Recognition 



In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09 and its related amendments regarding Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (ASC Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The standard provides principles for recognizing revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers with the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The standard also provides guidance on the recognition of incremental costs related to obtaining customer contracts.
We adopted ASC Topic 606, effective September 1, 2018, utilizing the modified retrospective method.
This approach was applied to contracts that were in process as of September 1, 2018, and the corresponding incremental costs of obtaining those contracts, which resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of adoption.
The reported results for fiscal year 2019 reflect the application of ASC Topic 606, while the reported results for fiscal year 2018 are not adjusted and continue to be reported under ASC Topic 605.
We generate revenue primarily from the sale of software licenses and providing consulting services to the pharmaceutical industry for drug development.
Sales commissions for new contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit.
Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period.
Most of our contracts are of a duration of one year or less, few, if any of the longer-term contracts have commissions associated with them.
Practical Expedients and Exemptions 



The Company has elected the following additional practical expedients in applying Topic 606: 



 • Commission Expense: We apply the practical expedient in ASC Topic 606 to expense costs as incurred for sales commissions when the period of benefit is one year or less.
Most of our contracts are of a duration of one year or less, few, if any of the longer term contracts have commissions associated with them.
ASC 606 provides certain practical expedients that limit the requirement to disclose the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations.
The Company applied the practical expedient to not disclose the amount of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations when the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.
7  



Cash and Cash Equivalents 



For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Accounts receivable are written off when all collection attempts have failed.
Amortization of capitalized software development costs is calculated on a product-by-product basis using the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the products (not to exceed five years).
Amortization of software development costs amounted to $344,714 and $335,723 for the three months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $683,787 and $621,032 for the six months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Property and Equipment 



Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Maintenance and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets 



The Company performs valuations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and recognizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair value.
Acquired intangible assets include customer relationships, software, trade names, and non-compete agreements.
The Company determines the appropriate useful life by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on historical experience of the acquired businesses.
Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, which approximates the pattern in which the majority of the economic benefits are expected to be consumed.
8  



Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets.
Goodwill is not amortized, instead it is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances change that would indicate that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below or the same as an operating segment.
As of February 28, 2019, the Company determined that it has three reporting units, Simulations Plus, Cognigen Corporation, and DILIsym Services, Inc.
When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform step one of a two-step annual goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit.
The Company is required to perform step one only if it concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value.
Should this be the case, the first step of the two-step process is to identify whether a potential impairment exists by comparing the estimated fair values of the Company's reporting units with their respective book values, including goodwill.
If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired, and no additional steps are necessary.
If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
The amount of the impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over its implied fair value.
If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
As of February 28, 2019, the entire balance of goodwill was attributed to two of the Company's reporting units, Cognigen Corporation and DILIsym Services.
Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.
The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Determining the fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the selection of appropriate valuation methodology, projected revenue, expenses and cash flows, weighted average cost of capital, discount rates, estimates of advertiser and publisher turnover rates, and estimates of terminal values.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 



Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Condensed Balance Sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.
The following table summarizes fair value measurements at February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018 for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 



February 28, 2019: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



August 31, 2018: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



As of February 28, 2019, and August 31, 2018, the Company has a liability for contingent consideration related to its acquisition of the DILIsym Services, Inc.
The fair-value measurement of the contingent consideration obligations is determined using Level 3 inputs.
The fair value of contingent consideration obligations is based on a discounted cash flow model using a probability-weighted income approach.
These fair-value measurements represent Level 3 measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market.
Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period.
Changes in the value of the contingent consideration obligations are recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The following is a reconciliation of contingent consideration value.
These costs include salaries, laboratory experiment, and purchased software that was developed by other companies and incorporated into, or used in the development of, our final products.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Amortization expense for each of the three-month and six-month periods ended February 28, 2019 and 2018 was $89,375 and $178,750, respectively.
According to policy, in addition to normal amortization, these assets are tested for impairment as needed.
11  



Earnings per Share 



We report earnings per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10.
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available.
Diluted earnings per share computation is similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.
The components of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Stock-Based Compensation 



Compensation costs related to stock options are determined in accordance with FASB ASC 718-10, “Compensation-Stock Compensation”, using the modified prospective method.
Under this method, compensation cost is calculated based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with FASB ASC 718-10, amortized on a straight-line basis over the options’ vesting period.
Stock-based compensation was $208,715 and $141,496 for the three months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, respectively and $408,744 and $271,717 for the six months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets 



The Company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long-lived assets in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other” and ASC 360, “Property and Equipment”.
We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the expected future undiscounted net cash flows generated by the asset.
No impairment losses were recorded during the six months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 



In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09).
The standard will eliminate the transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP) and replace it with a principles-based approach for determining revenue recognition.
ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
Early adoption is permitted for years beginning after December 15, 2016.
The revenue recognition standard is required to be applied retrospectively, including any combination of practical expedients as allowed in the standard.
The standard was adopted concurrently with the adoption of ASU 2016-10 which is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
12  



In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740) (“ASU 2015-17).
The pronouncement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
The Company has early adopted this pronouncement for the fiscal reporting period ended August 31, 2017 because it reduced complexity while maintaining the usefulness of the information.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in "Leases (Topic 840)" and generally requires all leases to be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted.
The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09).
This ASU affects entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees.
ASU 2016-09 will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.
The Company early adopted ASU No.
2016-09.
The adoption had no material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which amends certain aspects of the Board's new revenue standard, ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The standard was adopted concurrently with the adoption of ASU 2014-09 which is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
NOTE 3.
REVENUE RECOGNITION 



The Company adopted Topic 606 effective September 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method applying this guidance to all open contracts at the date of initial application, which resulted in an adjustment to retained earnings for the cumulative effect of applying this guidance.
The most significant impact of Topic 606 on revenue to the Company relates to the timing of revenue recognition for one of its payment contracts.
Under ASC 605 revenues were recognized as invoiced and certain costs were capitalized as development.
We generate revenue primarily from the sale of software licenses and providing consulting services to the pharmaceutical industry for drug development.
The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 13  



The Company accounts for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
Contracts generally have fixed pricing terms and are not subject to variable pricing.
The Company considers the nature and significance of each specific performance obligation under a contract when allocating the proceeds under each contract.
Accounting for contracts includes significant judgement in the estimation of estimated hours/cost to be incurred on consulting contracts, and the di minimis nature of the post sales costs associated with software sales.
Components of revenue 



The following is a description of principal activities from which the Company generates revenue.
As part of the accounting for these arrangements, the Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract.
Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells its services or goods.
Revenue Components   Typical payment terms 



Software Revenues: 



Software revenues are generated primarily from sales of software licenses at the time the software is unlocked and the term commences.
Should the customer need more than a di minimis amount of support they can choose to enter in to a separate contract for additional training.
Most software is installed on our customers servers and the Company has no control of the software once the sale is made.
For certain software arrangements the Company hosts the licenses on servers maintained by the Company, revenue for those arrangements are accounted as Software as a Service over the life of the contract.
These arrangements are a small portion of software revenues of the Company.
Payments are generally due upon invoicing on a net 30 basis unless other payment terms are negotiated with the customer based on customer history.
Typical industry standards apply.
Consulting Contracts:  



Consulting services provided to our customers are generally recognized over time as the contracts are performed and the services are rendered.
The company measures its consulting revenue based on time expended compared to total estimated hours to complete a project.
The Company believes the methods chosen for its contract revenue best depicts the transfer of benefits to the customer under the contracts.
Payment terms vary, depending on the size of the contract, credit history and history with the client and deliverables within the contract.
Consortium Member Based Services: 



The performance obligation is recognized on a time elapsed basis, by month, for which the services are provided, as the Company transfers control evenly over the contractual period.
Payment is due at the beginning of the period, generally on a net 30 or 60 basis.
Remaining performance obligations that do not fall under the expedients require the Company to perform various consulting and software development services and consortium memberships of approximately $3,300,000.
It is anticipated these revenues will be recognized within the next two and ½ years.
Contract liabilities 



During the three months and six months period ended February 28, 2019 the Company recognized $207,000 and $640,000 of revenue that was included in contract liabilities as of August 31, 2018.

NOTE 5: CONTRACTS PAYABLE 



DILIsym Acquisition Liabilities: 



On June 1, 2017, the Company acquired DILIsym Services, Inc.
The agreement provided for a working capital adjustment, an eighteen-month $1,000,000 holdback provision against certain representations and warrantees, and an Earn-out agreement of up to an additional $5,000,000 in Earn-out payments based on earnings over the next three years.
The Earn-out liability has been recorded at an estimated fair value.
Payments under the Earn-out liability started in FY 2019.
The first payment of $1,566,644 was made in September 2018, the holdback payment was made in December 2018.
It is estimated that approximately 40% of the original Earn-out liability will be paid in the second year and the remainder of the Earn-out will be paid in the following year.
As of February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018 the following liabilities have been recorded:
