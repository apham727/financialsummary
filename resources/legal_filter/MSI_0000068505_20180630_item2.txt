Item 2.
Executive Overview



Recent Developments



During the second quarter of 2018, we modified our internal reporting structure to better align the way financial information is reported to and analyzed by executive leadership in part as a result of recent acquisitions contributing to the growth within the newly aligned Services and Software segment.
Previously, we had two reporting segments: Products and Services.
The changes in reporting structure consist of Systems Integration related revenue and costs moving from the old Services segment into the newly presented Products and Systems Integration segment and Software related revenue and costs moving from the old Products segment into the newly presented Services and Software segment.
Our Business



We are a leading global provider of mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software, and services.
Our products and services help government, public safety and commercial customers improve their operations through increased effectiveness, efficiency, and safety of their mobile workforces.
We conduct our business globally and manage it by two segments:



Products and Systems Integration: The Products and Systems Integration segment offers an extensive portfolio of infrastructure, devices, accessories, video solutions, and the implementation, optimization, and integration of such systems, devices, and applications, including the Company’s: (i) “ASTRO” products, which meet the Association of Public Safety Communications Officials Project 25 standard, (ii) “Dimetra” products which meet the European Telecommunications Standards Institute Terrestrial Trunked Radio “TETRA” standard, (iii) Professional and Commercial Radio (“PCR”) products, (iv) broadband technology products, such as Long-Term Evolution (“LTE”), and (v) video solutions, such as video surveillance cameras.
The primary customers of the Products and Systems Integration segment are government, public safety and first-responder agencies, municipalities, and commercial and industrial customers who operate private communications networks and video solutions and manage a mobile workforce.
In the second quarter of 2018, the segment’s net sales were $1.2 billion, representing 68% of our consolidated net sales.
Services and Software: The Services and Software segment provides a full set of offerings for government, public safety and commercial communication networks.
Services includes a continuum of service offerings beginning with repair, technical support and maintenance.
More advanced offerings include monitoring, software updates and cybersecurity services.
Managed services offerings range from partial to full operation of customer or Motorola Solutions owned networks.
Software includes public safety and enterprise command center solutions, unified communications applications, and video software solutions, delivered both on premise and “as a service.” In the second quarter of 2018, the segment’s net sales were $571 million, representing 32% of our consolidated net sales.

The notes became fully convertible as of August 25, 2017.
The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 14.7476, as may be adjusted for dividends declared, per $1,000 principal amount (which is currently equal to a conversion price of $67.81 per share).
We intend to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash.

An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line.
The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if our credit rating changes.
We must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2017 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements



In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
2016-02, "Leases," which amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements.
The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2019 and interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted.
We will adopt the ASU on January 1, 2019, utilizing the modified retrospective method upon adoption.
We have begun to assess the impact of the ASU on our financial statements, including the package of available practical expedients, required disclosures, and changes to internal controls.
Based on the preliminary work completed, we expect a material impact to our balance sheet through the recording of right-of-use assets and lease obligations that were not required to be recorded within the balance sheet under current accounting standards.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
The ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2019 with adoption permitted immediately in any interim or annual period (including the current period).
The guidance related to cash flow and net investment hedges existing at the date of adoption should be applied using the modified retrospective method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
The guidance related to presentation and disclosure should be applied prospectively.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements



We adopted ASU No.
2016-16, “Accounting for Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory” on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method of adoption.
We recognized $30 million related to the cumulative effect of applying the ASU as an adjustment to our opening retained earnings balance.
The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under accounting standards in effect in those periods.
This ASU eliminates the prior application of deferring the income tax effect of intra-entity asset transfers, other than inventory, until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use.
We adopted ASU No.
2017-07, “Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) - Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective method of adoption.
The amendments in the ASU require that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic cost (benefit) and report that component in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period.
As a result of the ASU, the presentation of net periodic cost (benefit) has been updated to classify all components of our net periodic benefit, with the exception of the service cost component, within Other in Other income (expense) on the statement of operations.
We recorded $20 million and $4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, respectively, and $40 million and $1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2017, respectively.
We adopted ASU No.
2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," and all the related amendments (collectively “ASC 606”) on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.
We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to our opening retained earnings.
The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect in those periods.
We retained much of the same accounting treatment used to recognize revenue under ASC 606 as under accounting standards in effect in prior periods.
Services contracts continue to be recognized ratably over relevant contract terms as we stand ready to perform.
Finally, revenue on equipment sales continues to be recognized based on delivery terms as aligned with the transfer of control.
Under the new standard, we identified distinct promises to transfer goods and/or services within our contracts.
For contracts that are recognized under percentage of completion accounting, we considered the factors used to determine whether promises made in the contract are distinct and determined that devices and accessories represent distinct goods.
For the remaining promised goods and services within our system contracts, we continue to recognize revenue on these contracts using a cost-to-cost method based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer over time.
Under the new standard, revenue recognition for software sales is accelerated based on when control of software licenses and related support services are transferred to the customer.
Amounts deferred under previous software accounting rules due to a lack of vendor-specific objective evidence have been recognized as an adjustment through opening retained earnings.
40



 Historically, we presented transactions that involved a third-party sales representative on a net basis.
After considering the control concept and the remaining three indicators of gross presentation under the new standard, we have determined that we are the principal in contracts that involve a third-party sales representative.
Under prior accounting standards, we expensed sales commissions and other costs to obtain a contract as incurred.
However, under the new standard, we capitalize sales commissions and certain other costs as incremental costs to obtain a contract.
The new standard clarified the definition of a receivable and requires us to present our net position in a contract with a customer on the balance sheet.
The position is presented as either a receivable, contract asset, or a contract liability.
Under the new definition, accounts receivable are unconditional rights to consideration from a customer.
Contract assets represent rights to consideration from a customer in exchange for transferred goods and services that are conditional on events other than the passage of time.
Contract liabilities represent obligations to transfer goods and services for which we have received, or is due, consideration from a customer respectively.
We reclassified our customer positions to align with the new definitions and presentation guidance.
Accounts receivable which are not due from customers have been reclassified into Other current assets.
