NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



(Unaudited)



Note 1.Basis of Presentation



The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, and should be read in conjunction with the Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx or the Company) consolidated financial statements filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2017.
The interim financial statements are unaudited, but reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, of a normal, recurring nature necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented.
The Company uses a 52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31.
Fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017 are both 52-week years ending on March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017, respectively.
The quarters ended on December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 each consisted of 13 weeks.
The authoritative guidance provides a five-step process for recognizing revenue that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The new authoritative guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application.
The Company is currently evaluating the full impact of this new authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements, including selection of the transition method.
Upon adoption, the Company currently expects that it will record the balance of the deferred revenue (subject to true-ups) under Sell-Through to retained earnings, and the impact would be offset by the recognition of revenue on shipments post adoption under Sell-In.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2019 as the Company decided not to early adopt it in fiscal year 2018.
In January 2016, the FASB issued the final authoritative guidance regarding how companies measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method and how they present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option.
The authoritative guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for Xilinx would be the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
In February 2016, the FASB issued the authoritative guidance on leases.
Accordingly, a lessee will recognize a lease asset for its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability for the corresponding lease obligation.
The new authoritative guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, which for Xilinx would be the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
Early adoption is permitted.
The new authoritative guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients.
In addition, the transition will 



7

require application of the new authoritative guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for cash flow classification.
The new authoritative guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statement of cash flows.
The new authoritative guidance will be effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years, which for Xilinx would be the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In May 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarifies the scope of modification accounting for share-based compensation.
Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions.
The new guidance will reduce diversity in practice and result in fewer changes to the terms of an award being accounted for as modifications.
The new authoritative guidance will be effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, which for Xilinx would be the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the annual period.
The authoritative guidance will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2019 as the Company decided not to early adopt it in fiscal year 2018.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amended the accounting for hedging activities.
The guidance permits more hedging strategies to be eligible for hedge accounting and simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance in areas where practice issues exist.
The new authoritative guidance will be effective for public business entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, which for Xilinx would be the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim periods after issuance of the authoritative guidance.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
Note 3.Significant Customers and Concentrations of Credit Risk



Avnet, Inc. (Avnet), one of the Company’s distributors, distributes the Company’s products worldwide.
As of December 30, 2017 and April 1, 2017, Avnet accounted for 64% and 59% of the Company’s total net accounts receivable, respectively.
For the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, resale of product through Avnet accounted for 42% and 45% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues, respectively.
For the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, resale of product through Avnet accounted for 42% and 43% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues, respectively.
Xilinx is subject to concentrations of credit risk primarily in its trade accounts receivable and investments in debt securities to the extent of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.
The Company attempts to mitigate the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables through its credit evaluation process, collection terms, distributor sales to diverse end customers and through geographical dispersion of sales.
No end customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues for the third quarter as well as the first nine months of fiscal years 2018 and 2017.
The Company mitigates concentrations of credit risk in its investments in debt securities by currently investing approximately 85% of its portfolio in AA (or its equivalent) or higher grade securities as rated by Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s Investors Service.
The Company’s methods to arrive at investment decisions are not solely based on the rating agencies’ credit ratings.
Xilinx also performs additional credit due diligence and conducts regular portfolio credit reviews, including a review of counterparty credit risk related to the Company’s forward currency exchange and interest rate swap contracts.
Additionally, Xilinx limits its investments in the debt securities of a single issuer based upon the issuer’s credit rating and attempts to further mitigate credit risk by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer.
As of December 30, 2017, approximately 33% of the portfolio consisted of mortgage-backed securities.
Note 4.Fair Value Measurements



The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements established by the FASB defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market 



8

participants at the measurement date.
The Company primarily uses a consensus price or weighted-average price for its fair value assessment.
For certain securities with short maturities, such as discount commercial paper and certificates of deposit, the security is accreted from purchase price to face value at maturity.
If a subsequent transaction on the same security is observed in the marketplace, the price on the subsequent transaction is used as the current daily market price and the security will be accreted to face value based on the revised price.
There have not been any changes to the Company’s fair value methodology during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 and the Company did not adjust or override any fair value measurements as of December 30, 2017.
Fair Value Hierarchy



The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities.
The Company’s Level 1 assets consist of U.S. government securities, money market funds and equity securities.
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
The Company’s Level 2 assets consist of financial institution securities, non-financial institution securities, U.S. agency securities, foreign government and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, debt mutual funds, bank loans, asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities.
The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities also include foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts.
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The Company has no Level 3 assets and liabilities.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis



In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.
The following tables present information about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 30, 2017 and April 1, 2017:

Changes in Level 3 Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis



The following table is a reconciliation of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of December 30, 2017, the Company held no marketable securities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs.
Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis



The Company's $500.0 million principal amount of 2.125% notes due March 15, 2019 (2019 Notes), $500.0 million principal amount of 3.000% notes due March 15, 2021 (2021 Notes) and $750.0 million principal amount of 2.950% senior notes due June 1, 



11

2024 (2024 Notes) are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis for disclosure purposes.
The fair values of the 2019 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes as of December 30, 2017 were approximately $499.2 million, $504.7 million and $746.4 million, respectively, based on the last trading price for the period (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy due to relatively low trading volume).
However, the percentage of such losses to the total estimated fair value of the mortgage-backed securities was relatively insignificant.
The gross unrealized losses that had been outstanding for more than twelve months were primarily related to debt mutual funds and mortgage-backed securities, which were primarily due to the general rising of the interest-rate environment and foreign currency movement.
These investments are highly rated by the credit rating agencies, there have been no defaults on any of these securities and we have received interest payments as they become due.
Therefore, the Company believes that it will be able to collect both principal and interest amount due to the Company.
Additionally, in the past several years a portion of the Company's investment in the mortgage-backed securities were redeemed or prepaid by the debtors at par.
Furthermore, the aggregate of individual unrealized losses that had been outstanding for twelve months or more were not significant as of December 30, 2017 and April 1, 2017, the majority of which were related to debt mutual funds due to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
The Company neither intends to sell these investments nor concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that it will have to sell them until recovery of their carrying values.
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable debt securities (financial institution securities, non-financial institution securities, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, asset-backed securities, bank loans, mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities), by contractual maturity, are shown in the table below.
Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations without call or prepayment penalties.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of December 30, 2017, $1.98 billion of marketable debt securities with contractual maturities of greater than one year were classified as short-term investments.
Additionally, the above table did not include investments in money market funds, mutual funds and equity securities because these securities do not have specific contractual maturities.
13

Certain information related to available-for-sale securities is as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The cost of securities matured or sold is based on the specific identification method.
Note 6.Derivative Financial Instruments



The Company entered into interest rate swap contracts with certain independent financial institutions to manage interest rate risks related to fixed interest rate expenses from its 2024 Notes and floating interest rate income from its investments in marketable debt securities.
See “Note 10.
Debt and Credit Facility” for more discussion related to interest rate swap contracts.
The interest rate swap contracts were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the 2024 Notes, and were separately accounted for as a derivative.
The interest rate swap contracts and the 2024 Notes were initially measured at fair value.
During the nine months ended December 30, 2017, the net change in fair values of the interest rate swap contracts and the underlying 2024 Notes was $11.8 million, which was recorded as a derivative liability for the interest rate swap contacts (as a component of other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets) and also a reduction from the carrying amount of 2024 Notes.
There was no ineffectiveness during all periods presented.
Other than this arrangement, there have been no material changes to the Company's derivative financial instruments since April 1, 2017.
Note 7.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans



The Company’s equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term retention programs that cover employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company.
These plans are intended to attract and retain talented employees, consultants and non-employee directors and to provide such persons with a proprietary interest in the Company.
Stock-Based Compensation



The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock awards granted under the Company’s equity incentive plans and rights to acquire stock granted under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Employee Stock Option Plans



The types of awards allowed under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (2007 Equity Plan) include incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), restricted stock and stock appreciation rights.
To date, the Company has issued a mix of non-qualified stock options and RSUs under the 2007 Equity Plan; however, there was no issuance of stock options during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 and the entire fiscal year 2017.
The Company's stock-based compensation expenses related to options during the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 and the number of options outstanding as of December 30, 2017 



14

were not material.
On August 9, 2017, the stockholders approved an amendment to increase the authorized number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2007 Equity Plan by 1.9 million shares.
As of December 30, 2017, 11.3 million shares remained available for grant under the 2007 Equity Plan.
The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and nine months ended December 30, 2017 was $303 thousand and $3.5 million, respectively.
The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016 was $2.8 million and $24.2 million, respectively.
This intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise.
RSU Awards



A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information is as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The estimated fair values of RSU awards were calculated based on the market price of Xilinx common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on Xilinx common stock prior to vesting.
The per share weighted-average fair value of RSUs granted during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $67.40 ($49.50 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017), and for the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 was $60.36 ($43.40 for the first nine months of fiscal year 2017), which were calculated based on estimates at the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSU awards vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that the Company pays in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of its employees.
Financial Information.” During the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, the Company realized excess tax benefits of $17.5 million.
During the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, the Company realized excess tax benefits of $1.2 million and $10.9 million, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan



Under the ESPP, shares are only issued during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year.
Employees purchased 355 thousand shares for $16.9 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and 446 thousand shares for $15.0 million during 



15

the second quarter of fiscal year 2017.
The per-share weighted-average fair value of stock purchase rights granted under the ESPP during the second quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was $16.46 and $11.64, respectively.
The fair values of stock purchase plan rights granted in the second quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model at the date of grant using the following assumptions:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The next scheduled purchase under the ESPP is in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018.
On August 9, 2017, the stockholders approved an amendment to increase the authorized number of shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP by 2.0 million shares.
As of December 30, 2017, 9.9 million shares were available for future issuance under the ESPP.
Note 8.
Net Income Per Common Share



The computation of basic net income per common share for all periods presented is derived from the information on the condensed consolidated statements of income, and there are no reconciling items in the numerator used to compute diluted net income per common share.
The following table summarizes the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The total shares used in the denominator of the diluted net income per common share calculation include potentially dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding that are not included in basic net income per common share calculation.
The diluted shares were calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the impact of the equity incentive plans, the incremental shares issuable assuming conversion of the Company's $600.0 million principal amount of 2.625% convertible notes issued in June 2010 (2017 Convertible Notes), before its maturity on June 15, 2017, and exercise of warrants on a weighted-average outstanding basis.
The 2017 Convertible Notes matured during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, and the Company exercised its call options to neutralize the dilutive effect of the incremental shares from the 2017 Convertible Notes.
The warrants were fully settled during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018.
Because the number of diluted shares in the above table for the nine months ended December 30, 2017 was calculated based on a weighted-average outstanding basis, it included approximately 2.0 million shares of dilutive impact from the 2017 Convertible Notes through the maturity date and 5.5 million shares of dilutive impact from warrants before the settlement.
See "Note 10.
Debt and Credit Facility" for more discussion of the Company's debt, call options and warrants.
Outstanding stock options and RSUs under the Company's stock award plans to purchase approximately 248 thousand and 3.4 million shares, for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, respectively, were excluded from diluted net income per common share by applying the treasury stock method, as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
These options and RSUs could be dilutive in the future if the Company’s average share price increases and is greater than the combined exercise prices and the unamortized fair values of these options and RSUs.

Note 9.Inventories



Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method) or market (estimated net realizable value) and are comprised of the following:

Note 10.
Debt and Credit Facility



 2017 Convertible Notes



During the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company received conversion requests from the remaining holders of the 2017 Convertible Notes.
Upon settlement, the holders received a cash payment equal to the par value of the 2017 Convertible Notes of $457.9 million, as well as 9.0 million shares of the Company's common stock.
In conjunction with the settlement, the Company exercised its call options on its shares of common stock that it purchased to hedge against the dilution from the conversion of the 2017 Convertible Notes, and received 9.0 million shares from the hedge counterparties.
As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the 2017 Convertible Notes were no longer outstanding.
The carrying values of the liability and equity components of the 2017 Convertible Notes are reflected in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Prior to the conversion, interest expense related to the 2017 Convertible Notes was included in interest and other income (expense), net on the condensed consolidated statements of income, and was recognized as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



To reduce the hedging costs of purchasing the call options on its common stock as described above, the Company, under separate transactions, sold warrants to independent counterparties, which gave the counterparties the right to purchase up to 21.1 million shares of the Company's common stock at $40.26 per share.
All of the warrants were exercised as of December 30, 2017 and the Company issued 9.2 million shares of its common stock for the settlement.
17

2019 Notes and 2021 Notes



On March 12, 2014, the Company issued the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes at a discounted price of 99.477% and 99.281% of par, respectively.
Interest on the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15.
The Company received net proceeds of $990.1 million from issuance of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes, after the debt discount and deduction of debt issuance costs.
The debt discounts and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the terms of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes.
As of December 30, 2017, the remaining term of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are 1.2 years and 3.2 years, respectively.
The following table summarizes the carrying value of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes as of December 30, 2017 and April 1, 2017:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Interest expense related to the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes was included in interest and other income (expense), net on the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



2024 Notes



On May 30, 2017, the Company issued the 2024 Notes at a discounted price of 99.887% of par.
Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1.
The Company received net proceeds of $745.2 million from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, after the debt discount and deduction of debt issuance costs.
As of December 30, 2017, the remaining term of the 2024 Notes is approximately 6.5 years.
In relation to the issuance of the 2024 Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts with certain independent financial institutions, whereby the Company pays on a semi-annual basis, a variable interest rate equal to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 91.43 bps, and receives on a semi-annual basis, interest income at a fixed interest rate of 2.950%.
The Company earned a net interest income of $1.3 million and $3.4 million during the three and nine months ended December 30, 2017, respectively, from the interest rate swap contracts, which was included in interest and other income (expense), net on the condensed consolidated statements of income as a reduction to interest expense.

Revolving Credit Facility



On December 7, 2016, the Company entered into a $400.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that, upon certain conditions, may be extended by an additional $150.0 million, with a syndicate of banks (expiring in December 2021).
Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a benchmark rate plus an applicable margin based upon the Company’s credit rating.
In connection with the credit facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial and nonfinancial covenants.
As of December 30, 2017, the Company had made no borrowings under this credit facility and was not in violation of any of the covenants.
Note 11.
Common Stock Repurchase Program



The Board of Directors has approved stock repurchase programs enabling the Company to repurchase its common stock in the open market or through negotiated transactions with independent financial institutions.
On May 16, 2016, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1.00 billion of the Company's common stock and debentures (2016 Repurchase Program).
The 2016 Repurchase Program has no stated expiration date.
Through December 30, 2017, the Company had used $628.7 million of the $1.00 billion authorized under the 2016 Repurchase Program, leaving $371.3 million available for future repurchases.
The Company’s current policy is to retire all repurchased shares, and consequently, no treasury shares were held as of December 30, 2017 and April 1, 2017.
During the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, the Company repurchased 4.7 million shares of common stock in the open market and through accelerated share repurchase agreements with multiple independent financial institutions for a total of $310.8 million.
19

Note 12.
Note 14.
The Company recorded tax provisions of $20.7 million and $50.8 million for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of 13% and 10%, respectively.
As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact the Company in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, while other provisions will impact the Company beginning in fiscal year 2019.
The corporate tax rate reduction is effective as of January 1, 2018.
As a result, the Company’s fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate will be a blended rate of 31.5%.
However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 which will allow companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations.
As of December 30, 2017, the Company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax.
The Company recognized a provisional amount of $183.2 million, which was included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.
The larger balance was permanently reinvested outside the U.S.
The Company has not yet completed its calculation of the total post-1986 E&P for its foreign subsidiaries.
In addition, the one-time transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets either as of the end of fiscal year 2018 or the average of the year-end balances for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.
The Company remeasured deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future.
The provisional amount recorded for the remeasurement and resulting write-down of the Company's deferred tax balance was $26.2 million.
The Company’s actual write-down may vary materially from the provisional amount because the final analysis will be based on balances as of March 31, 2018 and actual activities of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018.
The Company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 30, 2017 increased by $91.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 to $121.5 million.
The increase is primarily attributable to an additional deduction claimed on federal and state amended tax returns for repurchase premium paid in connection with the early redemption of the Company’s 3.125% Junior Convertible debenture due March 15, 2037 (2037 Convertible Notes) in fiscal year 2014.
Another $85.5 million related to the 2037 Convertible Notes would increase additional paid-in capital.
Note 15.
Commitments



Xilinx leases some of its facilities and office buildings under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through April 2029.
Additionally, Xilinx entered into a land lease in conjunction with the Company’s building in Singapore, which will expire in November 2035 and the lease cost was settled in an up-front payment in June 2006.
Some of the operating leases for facilities and office buildings require payment of operating costs, including property taxes, repairs, maintenance and insurance.
Most of the Company’s leases contain renewal options for varying terms.
Approximate future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Aggregate future rental income to be received from owned property totaled $8.4 million as of December 30, 2017.
Rent expense, net of rental income, under all operating leases was $0.9 million and $3.0 million for the three and nine months ended December 30, 2017, respectively.

The terms and conditions of these indemnity obligations are limited by contract, which obligations are typically perpetual from the effective date of the agreement.
