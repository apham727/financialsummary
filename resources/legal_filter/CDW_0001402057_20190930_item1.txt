Basis of Presentation



The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2019 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 (the "Consolidated Financial Statements") have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and the rules and regulations of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for interim financial statements.
The significant accounting policies used in preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements were applied on a basis consistent with those reflected in the December 31, 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements.

Except as noted below for the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-02, Leases ("Topic 842"), there have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Leases



The Company enters into operating lease contracts, as assessed at contract inception, primarily for real estate, data centers and equipment.
At the lease commencement date, the Company records Operating lease liabilities based on the present value of the future lease payments.
In determining the present value of future lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date.
For real estate and data center contracts, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
For certain equipment leases, the Company applies a portfolio approach to account for the right-of-use asset and operating lease liability.
In assessing the lease term, the Company includes options to renew only when it is reasonably certain that it will be exercised; a determination which is at the sole discretion of the Company.
For equipment leases used in revenue generating activities, the Company will record a right-of-use asset and lease liability for leases with a term of 12 months or less.
The Company records lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term beginning on the commencement date.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 



Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments



In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
The ASU introduces a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables.
The ASU will be adopted on January 1, 2020.
The Company has established a cross-functional implementation team to analyze the effect of the ASU.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact the ASU will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
Accounting for Leases



On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted and applied Topic 842 resulting in the recognition of right-of-use assets and additional lease liabilities of $81 million as of January 1, 2019, mainly related to operating leases for the Company's real estate portfolio.
For additional details regarding the impact to the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets from adopting this standard, see Note 9 (Leases).

Financial Instruments



The Company's indebtedness creates interest rate risk on its variable-rate debt.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
11



The Company has interest rate cap agreements that entitle it to payments from the counterparty of the amount, if any, by which three-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") exceeds the strike rates of the caps during the agreement period in exchange for an upfront premium.
During 2019, the Company entered into interest rate cap agreements with a combined notional value of $1.2 billion resulting in premiums paid to the counterparties of $6 million.
The valuation of the interest rate cap agreements is derived by using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rates of the caps.
This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the interest rate cap agreements, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including LIBOR curves and implied volatilities.
The Company also incorporates insignificant credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.
The counterparty credit spreads are based on publicly available credit information obtained from a third-party credit data provider.
For additional details, see Note 7 (Long-Term Debt).
The interest rate cap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges.
The Company recorded an insignificant loss and a loss of $13 million, net of tax, into Accumulated other comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively.
The Company recorded a loss of $1 million and a gain of $3 million, net of tax, into Accumulated other comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company reclassified an insignificant amount and $2 million, respectively, from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings within Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company reclassified $1 million and $3 million, respectively, from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings within Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The Company expects to reclassify $7 million from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings within Interest expense, net during the next 12 months.
