including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies for which such borrowings are made. In addition, any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR, while any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs are subject to floating interest rates. Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, while borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program were at an average floating rate of 2.36% and (0.13)%, respectively. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2018, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly.
