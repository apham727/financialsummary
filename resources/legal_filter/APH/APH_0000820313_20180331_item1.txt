 Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation  
 Revenue Recognition  
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”, and collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”). Topic 606 supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance and requires entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services. The Company adopted Topic 606 as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Under this transition method, the Company’s results in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were not retrospectively adjusted as such results were recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition policy discussed under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of the Company’s 2017 Annual Report.  
 Table of Contents  
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016‑02”), which amends, among other things, the existing guidance by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets (right-to-use) and liabilities (for reasonably certain lease payments) arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. For leases with a term of twelve months or less, ASU 2016‑02 permits an entity to make an accounting policy election to recognize such leases as lease expense, generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. ASU 2016‑02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Entities are required to adopt ASU 2016-02 using a modified retrospective approach, which requires prior periods to be presented under this new standard with various practical expedients allowed. The Company has begun evaluating ASU 2016‑02, including the review of the necessary changes to our existing processes and controls and the implementation of a new system that will facilitate the adoption of this new standard, in order to determine its impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

 Prior to the adoption of Topic 606, the Company’s revenue recognition policy was in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective transition method, resulting in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replace certain related policies discussed under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (in Item 7) and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (in Note 1) of the Company’s 2017 Annual Report. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of the Company’s revenue recognition and related accounting policies and disclosures resulting from the adoption of Topic 606.

 Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities  
 The Company records contract assets or contract liabilities depending on the timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections on a contract-by-contract basis. Contract assets represent unbilled receivables, which generally arise when revenue recognized over time exceed amounts billed to customers. Contract liabilities represent billings or advanced consideration received from customers in excess of revenue recognized to date. As the Company’s performance obligations are typically less than one year, these amounts are generally recorded as current in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets within Other current assets or Other accrued expenses as of March 31, 2018. Contract assets and contract liabilities recorded in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets were not significant both at the date of adoption and as of March 31, 2018.

 On January 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its common stock for $382.0. These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and common stock and retained earnings were reduced accordingly. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had repurchased approximately 12.6 million shares for $1,000.0 under the previously announced $1,000.0 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, thus completing the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.   
 On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”). As of April 30, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 0.7 million shares of its common stock for $55.5 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.

 On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.19 to $0.23 per share effective with dividends declared in the second quarter of 2018.  
 Note 7—Earnings Per Share  
 There were no anti-dilutive common shares excluded from the computations above for both the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.  
 Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 Stock Options  
 In May 2017, the Company adopted the 2017 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries (the “2017 Employee Option Plan”). The Company also continues to maintain the 2009 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries, as amended (the “2009 Employee Option Plan”) and the 2000 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries, as amended (the “2000 Employee Option Plan”). No additional stock options will be granted under the 2009 Employee Option Plan. The 2000 Employee Option Plan expired in May 2011, except that its terms continue with respect to outstanding options granted thereunder. A committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has been authorized to grant stock options pursuant to the 2017 Employee Option Plan. The number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (“Common Stock”) reserved for issuance under the 2017 Employee Option Plan is 30,000,000 shares.  As of March 31, 2018, there were 23,016,700 shares of Common Stock available for the granting of additional stock options under the 2017 Employee Option Plan. Options granted under the 2017 Employee Option Plan and the 2009 Employee Option Plan generally vest ratably over a period of five years from the date of grant and are generally exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant. Options granted under the 2000 Employee Option Plan are fully vested and are generally exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant.   
 In 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Stock Option Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the “2004 Directors Option Plan”). The 2004 Directors Option Plan is administered by the Company’s Board of Directors. The 2004 Directors Option Plan expired in May 2014, except that its terms continue with respect to outstanding options granted thereunder. Options were last granted under the 2004 Directors Option Plan in May 2011. Options granted under the 2004 Directors Option Plan are fully vested and are generally exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant.  
 Table of Contents  
 As of March 31, 2018, the total compensation cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized was approximately $108.5 with a weighted average expected amortization period of 3.14 years.  
 The grant-date fair value of each option grant under the 2000 Employee Option Plan, the 2009 Employee Option Plan, the 2017 Employee Option Plan and the 2004 Directors Option Plan is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The grant-date fair value of each share grant is determined based on the closing share price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of the grant. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model for option grants requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected share price volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the Common Stock and implied volatility derived from related exchange traded options. The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option and expected exercise and historical post-vesting termination experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issuances with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share is based on the Company’s dividend rate.

 Restricted Shares  
 In 2012, the Company adopted the 2012 Restricted Stock Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the “2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan”). The 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan is administered by the Company’s Board of Directors. As of March 31, 2018, the number of restricted shares available for grant under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan was 124,164. Restricted shares granted under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan generally vest on the first anniversary of the grant date. Grants under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan entitle the holder to receive shares of the Company’s Common Stock without payment.  
 As of March 31, 2018, the total compensation cost related to non-vested restricted shares not yet recognized was approximately $0.1 with a weighted average expected amortization period of 0.13 years.  
 Note 10—Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits  
 In January 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 to fully fund its U.S. Plans, and estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, cash contributions to the Plans will aggregate approximately $90.0 in 2018. The timing and amount of cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of the Plans’ assets. This voluntary cash contribution made in the first quarter of 2018 is reflected as cash used in operating activities within Net change in other long-term assets and liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.  
 Table of Contents  
 The Company offers various defined contribution plans for certain U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements. The Company matches the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation. During the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company provided matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans of approximately $2.3 and $1.7, respectively.  
 Note 12—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  
 Intangible assets are included in Intangibles, net and other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $11.9 and $12.0, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, amortization expense relating to the Company’s current intangible assets estimated for the remainder of 2018 is approximately $35.3 and for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately $43.2 in 2019, $37.4 in 2020, $32.4 in 2021, $24.7 in 2022 and $22.2 in 2023.  
 Table of Contents  
 The Company has a $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which matures March 2021 and gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company may utilize the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. The carrying value of any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility would approximate their fair value due primarily to their market interest rates and would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 15). At March 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At March 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.  
 All of the Company’s outstanding senior notes (“Senior Notes”), listed in the table above, are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of senior notes at any time subject to certain terms and conditions, which include paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase and, with certain exceptions, a make-whole premium. The fair value of 
 Table of Contents  
each series of Senior Notes is based on recent bid prices in an active market and is therefore classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 15). The 2.55% Senior Notes are due in January 2019 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2018.   
 Table of Contents  
 Fair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. These requirements establish market or observable inputs as the preferred source of values. Assumptions based on hypothetical transactions are used in the absence of market inputs. The Company does not have any non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.  
 Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.  
 Level 3 Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.

 Three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017  
 Net sales were $1,866.9 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1,560.1 in the first quarter of 2017, which represented an increase of 20% in U.S. dollars, 16% in constant currencies and 12% organically over the same prior year quarter. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2018 increased 21% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 13% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The sales growth was driven by increases in the mobile devices, industrial, automotive, military, and commercial aerospace markets, arising primarily from organic growth along with contributions from the Company’s acquisitions. Net sales in both the mobile networks and information technology and data communications markets were relatively flat in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Net sales in the first quarter of 2018 in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband 
 Table of Contents  
market, were flat in U.S. dollars while decreasing 1% in constant currencies and 1% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2017.  
   (2)    Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year period(s) compared to the same period(s) in the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior periods from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior period net sales.   
   (3)    Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section. 
 Geographically, sales in the United States in the first quarter of 2018 increased approximately 15% in U.S. dollars ($527.0 in 2018 versus $457.9 in 2017) and 9% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2017. International sales in the first quarter of 2018 increased approximately 22% in U.S. dollars ($1,339.9 in 2018 versus $1,102.2 in 2017), 16% in constant currencies and 13% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar for the first quarter of 2018 had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $63.4 compared to the first quarter of 2017.   
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $230.0 or 12.3% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $201.8 or 12.9% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017. Administrative expenses represented approximately 5.0% of net sales for both the first quarter of 2018 and 2017. Research and development expenses represented approximately 2.8% of net sales for both the first quarter of 2018 and 2017. Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.5% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018 and represented approximately 5.2% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017.  
 Operating income was $376.9 or 20.2% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $314.1 or 20.1% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the first quarter of 2018 was $391.1 or 22.1% of net sales compared to $323.9 or 22.1% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017. Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the first quarter of 2018 was $11.3 or 11.7% of net sales compared to $13.7 or 14.2% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the first quarter of 2018, compared to the first quarter of 2017, was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs.  
 Interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $24.5 compared to $19.3 for the first quarter of 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates associated with the Company’s commercial paper borrowings as well as the senior note issuances in April 2017, along with higher average debt levels used to fund the Company’s dividend and stock buyback programs.  
 Provision for income taxes for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 were at an effective tax rate of 24.4% and 23.8%, respectively. For the first quarter of 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 110 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.01. 
 Table of Contents  
For the first quarter of 2017, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 270 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.02. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, for the first three months of 2018 and 2017 was 25.5% and 26.5%, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. Refer to Note 14 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to income taxes.

 Cash Flow Summary  
 Operating Activities  
 The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $130.2 in the first three months of 2018 compared to $237.8 in the first three months of 2017. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities (“operating cash flow”) for the first three months of 2018 compared to the first three months of 2017 is primarily related to the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fully fund its U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”, and together with its foreign plans, the “Plans”) as well as a slightly higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital, all of which was partially offset by an increase in net income in the first three months of 2018.   
 In the first three months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $133.3, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $99.3 and $65.5, respectively, and an increase in inventories of $55.8, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $118.3. In the first three months of 2017, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $66.8, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to a decrease in accrued expenses of $66.0 and increases in inventories and other current assets of $23.9 and $21.0, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $48.6.  
 The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable decreased $82.8 to $1,515.8 primarily due to lower sales in the first quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, which were partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 (“Translation”). Days sales outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were approximately 74 and 73 days, respectively. Inventories increased $59.9 to $1,166.8, primarily to support expected future sales levels, as well as the effect of Translation. Inventory days at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were 84 and 76 days, respectively. Other current assets increased $33.4 to $230.2 primarily due to the recording of contract assets of $21.9 in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 as well as an increases in other receivables. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $22.5 to $839.3 primarily due to capital expenditures of $54.9 as well as Translation, partially offset by depreciation of $47.4. Goodwill increased $103.9 to $4,146.5 primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to an acquisition in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that closed in the first quarter of 2018, as well as Translation. Accounts payable decreased $77.4 to $798.2, primarily as a result of payments on outstanding payables, which more than offset purchasing activity. Payable days at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were approximately 57 and 60 days, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, decreased $66.1 to $636.6 primarily as a result of decreases in accrued wages and salaries and other employee-related compensation and benefits, partially offset by an increase in accrued income taxes. Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased $81.5 to $190.5 primarily due to the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in January 2018 to fully fund the Company’s U.S. Plans.  
 Table of Contents  
 In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. As described in more detail above, the decrease in Free Cash Flow is primarily related to the decrease in operating cash flow during the first three months of 2018 which is driven by the voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plans of approximately $81.0 as discussed above, along with an increase in capital expenditures.   
 Investing Activities  
 Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, net sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, and acquisitions.   
 Net cash used in investing activities was $142.3 in the first quarter of 2018, while net cash provided by investing activities was $8.9 in the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $99.5 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $54.1, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $11.3. In the first quarter of 2017, cash provided by investing activities was driven primarily by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $103.9, partially offset by capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $48.4 and the funding of acquisitions of $46.6.   
 Financing Activities  
 Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests.   
 Net cash used in financing activities was $728.2 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $53.7 in the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $382.0, net repayments of long-term debt of $304.8, dividend payments of $58.1 and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $3.9, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $20.6. For the first quarter of 2017, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $249.2, dividend payments of $49.3, and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $4.2, partially offset by increased net borrowings of $225.3 and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $23.7.  
 The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity. The Company’s debt financing includes the use of a commercial paper program, revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.  
 The Company has a $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which matures March 2021 and gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company intends to utilize the Revolving 
 Table of Contents  
Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At March 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At March 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.  
 The Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions. The 2.55% Senior Notes are due in January 2019 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2018.  
 Refer to Note 13 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.  
 On January 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”). During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its common stock for $382.0. These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and common stock and retained earnings were reduced accordingly. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had repurchased approximately 12.6 million shares for $1,000.0 under the previously announced $1,000.0 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, thus completing the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.  
 On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”). As of April 30, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 0.7 million shares of its common stock for $55.5 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.

 On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.19 to $0.23 per share effective with dividends declared in the second quarter of 2018.  
 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Commercial Paper Program, the Revolving Credit Facility, and its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the recent issuances of both the 2020 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes in April 2017) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future, including the repayment of the $750.0 outstanding principal amount of 2.55% Senior Notes due January 2019 (the “2.55% Notes”).  
 The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends, debt service (including the repayment of the 2.55% Notes), and payments associated with the Transition Tax which is payable in annual installments until 2025 and taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Program. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions.  
 Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

   ·    Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects, that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined below, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares as reported in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
   ·    Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income). 
   ·    Free Cash Flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities (“operating cash flow” - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), both of which are derived from the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company, as we believe it is useful for management and investors to assess our ability to generate cash, as well as to assess how much cash can be used to reinvest in the growth of the Company or to return to shareholders through either stock repurchases or dividends.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
 The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. The Company does not have any significant concentration with any one counterparty. There has been no material change in the Company’s assessment of its sensitivity to foreign currency exchange rate risk since its presentation set forth in Part II, Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in its 2017 Annual Report. The Company may borrow under its Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR, while any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are subject to floating interest rates. Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates. As of March 31, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, while borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program were at an average floating rate of 2.33%. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2018, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly.
