Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
On January 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 842 using the updated modified retrospective transition approach allowed under ASU 2018-11 and did not restate prior periods. The Company recognized ROU assets and related lease liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2019 of approximately $180 related to our operating 
Disaggregation of Net Sales

Note 5—Reportable Business Segments
and markets a broad range of connector and connector systems, value-add products and other products, including antennas and sensors, used in a broad range of applications in a diverse set of end markets. The Cable Products and Solutions segment primarily designs, manufactures and markets cable, value-add products and components for use primarily in the broadband communications and information technology markets as well as certain applications in other markets. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those for the Company as a whole and are described herein and in Note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s 2018 Annual Report. The Company evaluates the performance of business units on, among other things, profit or loss from operations before interest, headquarters’ expense allocations, stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, amortization related to certain intangible assets and nonrecurring gains and losses.
Note 6—Shareholders’ Equity and Noncontrolling Interests
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is classified below net income. Earnings per share is determined after the impact of the noncontrolling interests’ share in net income of the Company. In addition, the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests is presented as a separate caption within equity.
On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 2.6 million and 4.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $248.7 and $408.7, respectively, under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases during the first six months of 2019, 1.0 million shares, or $87.6, have been retained in Treasury stock; the remaining 3.4 million shares, or $321.1, have been retired by the Company. The Company has not repurchased any additional shares of its Common Stock through July 23, 2019, and has remaining authorization to purchase up to $1,038.1 of its Common Stock under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.
On January 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $382.0 under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, bringing total repurchases under this program to 12.6 million shares or $1,000.0, thus completing the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program. These repurchases in the first quarter of 2018, coupled with the Company’s repurchase of 3.1 million shares of its Common Stock for $263.4 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program during the three months ended June 30, 2018, resulted in total repurchases of 7.3 million shares for $645.4 during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
On July 23, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.23 to $0.25 per share effective with dividends declared in the third quarter of 2019.
Note 7—Earnings Per Share
Excluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive common shares of 7.7 million and 1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive common shares of 7.1 million and 0.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In August 2018, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Inspector General, requesting documents pertaining to certain products manufactured by the Company’s Military and Aerospace Group that are purchased or used by the U.S. government. The Company is cooperating with the request. The inquiry remains in the early stages and the Company is unable to estimate the timing or outcome of the matter.
Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s income before income taxes was reduced for stock-based compensation expense of $29.8 and $26.0, respectively. In addition, for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized aggregate income tax benefits of $23.5 and $10.8, respectively, in the provision for 
Stock Options
In May 2017, the Company adopted the 2017 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries (the “2017 Employee Option Plan”). A committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has been authorized to grant stock options pursuant to the 2017 Employee Option Plan. The number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (“Common Stock”) reserved for issuance under the 2017 Employee Option Plan is 30,000,000 shares. As of June 30, 2019, there were 10,920,560 shares of Common Stock available for the granting of additional stock options under the 2017 Employee Option Plan. The Company also continues to maintain the 2009 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries, as amended (the “2009 Employee Option Plan”). No additional stock options will be granted under the 2009 Employee Option Plan. Options granted under the 2017 Employee Option Plan and the 2009 Employee Option Plan generally vest ratably over a period of five years from the date of grant and are generally exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant.  
In 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Stock Option Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the “2004 Directors Option Plan”). The 2004 Directors Option Plan is administered by the Company’s Board of Directors. The 2004 Directors Option Plan expired in May 2014, except that its terms continue with respect to any outstanding options granted thereunder. Options were last granted under the 2004 Directors Option Plan in May 2011. Options granted under the 2004 Directors Option Plan are fully vested and are generally exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant.
As of June 30, 2019, the total compensation cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized was approximately $181.5 with a weighted average expected amortization period of 3.74 years.
The grant-date fair value of each option grant under the 2009 Employee Option Plan, the 2017 Employee Option Plan and the 2004 Directors Option Plan is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The grant-date fair value of each share grant is determined based on the closing share price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of the grant. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model for option grants requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected share price volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the Common Stock and implied volatility derived from related exchange traded options. The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option and expected exercise and historical experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issuances with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share is based on the Company’s dividend rate.
Restricted Shares
In 2012, the Company adopted the 2012 Restricted Stock Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the “2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan”). The 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan is administered by the Company’s Board of Directors. As of June 30, 2019, the number of restricted shares available for grant under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan was 94,846. Restricted shares granted under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan generally vest on the first anniversary of the grant date. Grants under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan entitle the holder to receive shares of the Company’s Common Stock without payment.
As of June 30, 2019, the total compensation cost related to non-vested restricted shares not yet recognized was approximately $1.1 with a weighted average expected amortization period of 0.89 years.
Note 10—Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans (the “U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “Foreign Plans” and, together with the U.S. Plans, the “Plans”). The following is a summary, based on the most recent 
In January 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 to fund the U.S. Plans. This voluntary cash contribution made in the first quarter of 2018 was reflected as cash used in operating activities within Net change in accrued pension and postretirement benefits in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future. 
The Company offers various defined contribution plans for certain U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements. Through 2018, the Company matched the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company increased its matching of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans to a maximum of 6% of eligible compensation. During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company provided matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans of approximately $7.2 and $4.3, respectively.
In January 2019, pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on November 27, 2018, the Company acquired SSI Controls Technologies (“SSI”), the sensor manufacturing division of SSI Technologies, Inc., for approximately $397, net of cash acquired (subject to customary post-closing adjustments), plus a performance-related contingent payment. SSI, which is headquartered in the United States (Wisconsin), is a leading designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensing solutions for the global automotive and industrial markets. The acquisition of SSI is not material to the Company. The contingent consideration payment is based on certain 2019 revenue and profitability levels of SSI. The Company determined the fair value of this liability using Level 3 unobservable inputs, such as probability weighted payout projections, and is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 16). The contingent consideration is payable in 2020 and recorded in Other accrued expenses on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2019.
During the first six months of 2019, the Company completed five acquisitions (including SSI) for $756.2, net of cash acquired. All but one of the acquisitions are included in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. The Company is in the process of completing its analyses of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company anticipates that the final assessments of values will not differ materially from the preliminary assessments. These acquisitions were not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. 
Note 12—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The increase in goodwill, net of foreign currency translation, during the first six months of 2019 is due to the Company’s acquisitions during the first half of 2019.
Intangible assets are included in Intangibles, net and other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The increase in the carrying amounts of intangible assets during the first six months of 2019 was primarily due to intangible assets acquired as a result of the SSI acquisition, along with the other acquisitions closed during the period. The amortization expense for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $15.6 and $11.9, respectively. The amortization expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $40.4 and $23.8, respectively. Amortization expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 includes $3.2 and $15.7, respectively, related to the amortization of acquired backlog, primarily related to the SSI acquisition. As of June 30, 2019, amortization expense relating to the Company’s current intangible assets estimated for the remainder of 2019 is approximately $25.6 and for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately $46.8 in 2020, $42.1 in 2021, $34.8 in 2022, $32.0 in 2023 and $28.5 in 2024.
On January 15, 2019, the Company amended its $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “2016 Revolving Credit Facility”) with a $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility (“2019 Revolving Credit Facility”). The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the lenders’ aggregate commitments by $500.0 and, consistent with the previous 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company may utilize the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The carrying value of any borrowings under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility would approximate their fair value due primarily to their market interest rates and would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 16). The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.
The Company has a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (“U.S. Commercial Paper” or “USCP Notes”) in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”). The maturities of the USCP Notes vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The USCP Notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at par or a discount therefrom, and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. The average interest rate on the U.S. Commercial Paper as of June 30, 2019 was 2.58%. 
The Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) also has a euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The maturities of the ECP Notes will vary, but may not exceed 183 days from the date of issue.  The ECP Notes are sold under customary terms in the euro-commercial paper market and may be issued at par or a discount therefrom or a premium thereto and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. Dollars or other currencies. As of June 30, 2019, the amount of ECP Notes outstanding was €215.0 (approximately $244.5), with an average interest rate of (0.10)%. 
U.S. Senior Notes
On January 9, 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029 at 99.904% of face value (the “2029 Senior Notes”). The 2029 Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on the 2029 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2029 Senior Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to March 1, 2029, a make-whole premium. In January 2019, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2029 Senior Notes, along with borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay $750.0 of 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.  
All of the Company’s outstanding senior notes in the United States (“U.S. Senior Notes”) are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes at any time subject to certain terms and conditions, which include paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase and, with certain exceptions, a make-whole premium. The fair value of each series of U.S. Senior Notes is based on recent bid prices in an active market and is therefore classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 16). The Company’s 2.20% Senior Notes are due in April 2020 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2019. The U.S. Senior Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants. At June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its U.S. Senior Notes.
On October 8, 2018, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $574.6) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 at 99.498% of face value (the “2028 Euro Notes” or “2.000% Euro Senior Notes”) and collectively with the U.S. Senior Notes, “Senior Notes”). The 2028 Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. Interest on the 2028 Euro Notes is payable annually on October 8 of each year, commencing on October 8, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2028 Euro Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to July 8, 2028, a make-whole premium. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.  The 2028 Euro Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants. At June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its 2028 Euro Notes.
For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering our Provision for income taxes by approximately $12.9 and $3.0, respectively, and lowering our effective tax rate by approximately 350 basis points and 80 basis points, respectively, due to the recognition of excess tax benefits within Provision for income taxes in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering our Provision for income taxes by approximately $19.7 and $7.1, respectively, and lowering our effective tax rate by approximately 270 basis points and 100 basis points, respectively.
Amphenol is a lessee of buildings, office space, automobiles and equipment throughout the world, nearly all of which are classified as operating leases expiring at various dates. The Company determines if an arrangement qualifies as a lease at lease inception. The Company adopted Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019. Operating lease liabilities are recorded based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term, assessed as of the commencement date. The Company’s real estate leases, which are comprised primarily of manufacturing facilities, warehouses and sales offices, represent the vast majority of our operating lease liabilities and generally have a lease term between 2 and 12 years. The remaining leases consist primarily of machinery and equipment used in production, office equipment and vehicles, each with various lease terms. The vast majority of our leases are comprised of fixed lease payments, with a small percentage of the Company’s real estate leases including lease payments tied to a rate or index which may be subject to variability. Certain real estate leases also include executory costs such as common area maintenance (non-lease component), as well as property insurance and property taxes (non-components). As a practical expedient permitted under Topic 842, we have elected to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for our real estate leases. Lease payments, which may include lease components, non-lease components and non-components, are included in the measurement of the Company’s lease liabilities to the extent that such payments are 
either fixed amounts or variable amounts based on a rate or index (fixed in substance) as stipulated in the lease contract. Any actual costs in excess of such amounts are expensed as incurred as variable lease cost. 
Substantially all of our lease agreements do not specify an implicit borrowing rate, and as such, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate by lease term, in order to calculate the present value of our future lease payments. The discount rate represents a risk-adjusted rate on a secured basis, and is the rate at which the Company would borrow funds to satisfy the scheduled lease liability payment streams commensurate with the lease term. On January 1, 2019, the discount rate used on existing leases at adoption was determined based on the remaining lease term using available data as of that date. For new or renewed leases starting in 2019, the discount rate is determined using available data at lease commencement and based on the lease term including any reasonably certain renewal periods. 
Operating Leases
Prior to January 1, 2019, the Company accounted for its leases in accordance with Topic 840, Leases. At December 31, 2018, the Company was committed under operating leases for buildings, office space, automobiles and equipment, which expired at various dates. As previously disclosed in our 2018 Annual Report and under previous lease accounting guidance, future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2018 totaled $197.3, comprised of $70.5 for 2019, $39.0 for 2020, $25.9 for 2021, $16.5 for 2022, $11.9 for 2023, and $33.5 for the years beyond 2023.
In rare circumstances, the Company may enter into finance leases for specific equipment used in manufacturing, in which the Company takes ownership of the asset upon the end of the lease. The Company records its finance leases within Property, plant and equipment, Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s finance leases and related depreciation and interest expense, cash flows and impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements were not material individually or in the aggregate as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019.
Fair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. These requirements establish market or observable inputs as the preferred source of values. Assumptions based on hypothetical transactions are used in the absence of market inputs. The Company does not have any non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.
Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 3 Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.
With the exception of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisition accounting, the Company does not have any other significant financial or non-financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
Three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2018
Net sales were $2,015.3 in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $1,981.4 in the second quarter of 2018, which represented an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 4% in constant currencies, and a decrease of 1% organically over the same respective prior year period. Net sales were $3,973.8 in the first six months of 2019 compared to $3,848.3 in the first six months of 2018, which represented an increase of 3% in U.S. dollars, 6% in constant currencies and 2% organically over the same respective prior year period. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 96% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2019 increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% in constant currencies, with flat organic growth, compared to the second quarter of 2018. The sales growth in the second quarter of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by contributions from the Company’s acquisition program, with growth in the military, commercial aerospace, mobile networks and mobile devices markets, offset in part by moderations in the broadband, industrial, and information technology and data communications markets. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the first six months of 2019 increased 4% in U.S. dollars, 6% in constant currencies and 2% organically, compared to the first six months of 2018. The sales growth for the first six months of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by growth in the military, commercial aerospace, mobile networks, information technology and data communications, and industrial markets including contributions from the Company’s acquisition program, offset in part by moderations in the broadband, mobile devices and automotive markets. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 4% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2019, which primarily serves the broadband market, decreased 
19% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 18% organically, compared to the second quarter of 2018. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) in the first six months of 2019 decreased 11% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 8% organically, compared to the first six months of 2018. The decrease in net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was primarily due to a reduction in demand at broadband service providers.
Geographically, sales in the United States in the second quarter of 2019 increased approximately 10% in U.S. dollars ($632.8 in 2019 versus $576.3 in 2018) with flat organic growth, compared to the second quarter of 2018, and increased approximately 10% in U.S. dollars ($1,211.7 in 2019 versus $1,103.3 in 2018) and 3% organically in the first six months of 2019, compared to the first six months of 2018. Foreign sales in the second quarter of 2019 decreased approximately 2% in U.S. dollars ($1,382.5 in 2019 versus $1,405.1 in 2018) and 2% organically, while increasing 1% in constant currencies, compared to the second quarter of 2018, and increased approximately 1% in U.S. dollars ($2,762.1 in 2019 versus $2,745.0 in 2018), 4% in constant currencies and 1% organically in the first six months of 2019, compared to the first six months of 2018. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $41.9 and $88.6, respectively, compared to the same respective periods in 2018. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $239.2 or 11.9% of net sales and $474.3 or 11.9% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively, compared to $236.6 or 11.9% of net sales and $466.6 or 12.1% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. Administrative expenses represented approximately 4.6% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2019, and represented approximately 4.8% and 4.9% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. Research and development expenses represented approximately 2.9% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2019, and represented approximately 2.8% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2018. Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.4% of net sales for both the second quarter and first six months of 2019, and represented approximately 4.4% and 4.5% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. 
Operating income was $399.5 or 19.8% of net sales and $775.7 or 19.5% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively, compared to $408.2 or 20.6% of net sales and $785.1 or 20.4% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. Operating income for the second quarter of 2019 included $8.9 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) comprised primarily of external transaction costs of $5.7, as well as the amortization of $3.2 related to the value associated with acquired backlog from an acquisition which closed in the second quarter of 2019. Operating income for the first six months of 2019 included $25.4 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) comprised of the amortization of $15.7 related to the value associated with acquired backlog from two acquisitions, as well as external transaction costs of $9.7. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, these acquisition-related expenses had the effect of decreasing net income by $7.8 or $0.03 per share and $21.0 or $0.07 per share, respectively. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was $408.4 or 20.3% of net sales and $801.1 or 20.2% of net sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 was $428.4 or 22.2% of net sales and $838.5 or 22.1% of net sales, respectively, compared to $419.7 or 22.4% and $810.9 or 22.3% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. The slight decrease in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2019, compared to the same respective periods in 2018, was primarily driven by the impact of recent acquisitions which currently have, on average, a lower operating margin than the average of the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for such periods. Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 was $8.7 or 9.7% of net sales and $19.1 or 10.3% of net sales, respectively, compared to $14.7 or 13.2% of net sales and $26.0 or 12.5% of net sales for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the second quarter and first six months of 2019, compared to the same respective periods in 2018, was primarily driven by lower volumes and product mix.
Interest expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 was $30.0 and $59.7, respectively, compared to $26.0 and $50.5 for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively.  The increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher average debt levels, along with higher average interest rates on the Company’s U.S. commercial paper borrowings as well as the new 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes issuance in January 2019. The borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and net proceeds from the 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes were used to repay the Company’s 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes in January 2019. 
Provision for income taxes for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 was at an effective tax rate of 21.3% and 22.0%, respectively. Provision for income taxes for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was at an effective tax rate of 24.7% and 24.5%, respectively. For the second quarter and first six months of 2019 and 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the tables below. The effective tax rate for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 was further impacted by the tax effect of acquisition-related expenses during such periods of 2019, as noted in the tables below. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 2, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 was 24.5%, and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was 25.5%, as reconciled in the tables below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. Refer to Note 14 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to income taxes.
six months of 2018. Excluding the effect of the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses discussed above, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS were $557.3 and $1.81, respectively, for the first six months of 2019, compared to $543.3 and $1.73, respectively, for the first six months of 2018.
At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $997.3 and $1,291.7, respectively. The majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 is located outside of the United States. 
The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the Commercial Paper Programs, and the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes in January 2019, discussed further within this Item 2) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months.
The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the Transition Tax (which is payable in annual installments until 2025), taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings), and funding of pension obligations. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company’s Senior Notes, the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Programs (all as defined below). The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions.
Cash Flow Summary
Operating Activities
The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $666.0 in the first six months of 2019 compared to $395.3 in the first six months of 2018.  The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow”) for the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 is primarily related to a lower usage of cash related to the change in working capital. In addition, Operating Cash Flow for the first six months of 2018 included the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 during that period to fund its U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”, and together with its foreign plans, the “Plans”), while no such voluntary cash contributions to the U.S. Plans were made in the first six months of 2019. 
In the first six months of 2019, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $66.6, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to decreases in accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $124.6 and accounts payable of $107.0, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of $157.9 and inventories of $13.1. In the first six months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $185.5, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to an increase in inventories of $80.0, accounts receivable of $44.5 and other current assets of $29.8, as well as a decrease in accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $44.8, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $13.6.
resulting from lower sales activity. Inventory days at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were 83 and 74 days, respectively. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $94.2 to $970.0, primarily due to capital expenditures of $149.9 and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by depreciation of $120.5. Goodwill increased $602.9 to $4,706.1, primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to acquisitions that closed during the first six months of 2019, which was partially offset by Translation. Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $241.5 to $735.8, primarily due to (i) the adoption of the new lease standard (“Topic 842”) described in Note 15 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which resulted in the recognition of $178.9 of operating lease right-of-use assets as of June 30, 2019 and (ii) the recognition of certain intangible assets related to the SSI acquisition and other 2019 acquisitions, partially offset by (iii) the amortization of $40.4 related to the Company’s intangible assets during the six months ended June 30, 2019. Accounts payable decreased $75.9 to $814.6, primarily due to less purchasing activity resulting from lower sales activity, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions as well as Translation. Payable days at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were approximately 53 days. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $38.7 to $835.2, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $58.6 of current operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2019, and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by certain tax payments. Other long-term liabilities increased $90.9 to $623.7, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of approximately $121.7 of long-term operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2019, partially offset by a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities.
There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution to fund the Company’s U.S. Plans of approximately $81.0.
In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. The increase in Free Cash Flow is driven by an increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above.
Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, net sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, and acquisitions. 
Net cash used in investing activities was $903.1 in the first six months of 2019, compared to $283.1 in the first six months of 2018. In the first six months of 2019, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $756.2 in cash to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $144.4, and net purchases of short-term investments of $2.5. In the first six months of 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $158.8 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $132.6, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $8.3. 
Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments, and distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests. 
The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity. The Company’s debt financing includes the use of commercial paper programs, revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.
On January 15, 2019, the Company amended its $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “2016 Revolving Credit Facility”) with a $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility (“2019 Revolving Credit Facility”). The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the lenders’ aggregate commitments by $500.0 and, consistent with the previous 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company may utilize the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At June 30, 2019, there were no borrowings under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. commercial paper program, the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”). The amount of U.S. commercial paper notes outstanding (“USCP Notes”) as of June 30, 2019 was $1,048.4. 
Pursuant to the terms of the euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”), the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, the “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. Dollars or other currencies. The amount of ECP Notes outstanding as of June 30, 2019 was €215.0 (approximately $244.5). 
The U.S. Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions. In January 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029 at 99.904% of face value, the net proceeds of which were used, along with proceeds from borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the $750.0 of the Company’s 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019. 
On October 8, 2018, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $574.6) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 at 99.498% of face value (the “2028 Euro Notes”). The 2028 Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. Interest on the 2028 Euro Notes is payable annually on October 8 of each year, commencing on October 8, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2028 Euro Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to July 8, 2028, a make-whole premium. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.  
The Company’s Senior Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants. Refer to Note 13 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.
On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 2.6 million shares of its Common Stock for $248.7, while during the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 4.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $408.7, all under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases during the first six months of 2019, 1.0 million shares, or $87.6, have been retained in Treasury stock; the remaining 3.4 million shares, or $321.1, have been retired by the Company. The Company has not repurchased any additional shares of its Common Stock through July 23, 2019, and has remaining authorization to purchase up to $1,038.1 of its Common Stock under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.
On January 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $382.0 under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, bringing total repurchases under this program to 12.6 million shares or $1,000.0, thus completing the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program. These repurchases in the first quarter of 2018, coupled with the Company’s repurchase of 3.1 million shares of its Common Stock for $263.4 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program during the three months ended June 30, 2018, resulted in total repurchases of 7.3 million shares for $645.4 during the six months ended June 30, 2018.
On July 23, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.23 to $0.25 per share effective with dividends declared in the third quarter of 2019.
Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
●Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects, that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined below, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares as reported in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
●Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income).
●Free Cash Flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow” - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), both of which are derived from the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company, as we believe it is useful for management and investors to assess our ability to generate cash, as well as to assess how much cash can be used to reinvest in the growth of the Company or to return to shareholders through either stock repurchases or dividends.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
may continue to be denominated in foreign currencies, and there can be no assurance that the Company can successfully manage these changes in exchange rates, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies for which such borrowings are made. In addition, any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR, while any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs are subject to floating interest rates. Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates. As of June 30, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, while borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program were at an average floating rate of 2.58% and (0.10)%, respectively. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2019, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly.
