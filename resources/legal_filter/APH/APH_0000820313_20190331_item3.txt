Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates. As of March 31, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, while borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program were at an average floating rate of 2.64% and (0.10)%, respectively. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2019, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly.
