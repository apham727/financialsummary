 Note 7—Earnings Per Share  
 Excluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive common shares of 6.3 million and nil for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  
 In August 2018, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Inspector General, requesting documents pertaining to certain products manufactured by the Company’s Military and Aerospace Group that are purchased or used by the U.S. government. The Company is cooperating with the request. The inquiry remains in the early stages and the Company is unable to estimate the timing or outcome of the matter.

 Stock Options  
 In May 2017, the Company adopted the 2017 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries (the “2017 Employee Option Plan”). A committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has been authorized to grant stock options pursuant to the 2017 Employee Option Plan. The number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (“Common Stock”) reserved for issuance under the 2017 Employee Option Plan is 30,000,000 shares.  As of March 31, 2019, there were 16,982,040 shares of Common Stock available for the granting of additional stock options under the 2017 Employee Option Plan. The Company also continues to maintain the 2009 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries, as amended (the “2009 Employee Option Plan”). No additional stock options will be granted under the 2009 Employee Option Plan. Options granted under the 2017 Employee Option Plan and the 2009 Employee Option Plan generally vest ratably over a period of five years from the date of grant and are generally exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant.    
 In 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Stock Option Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the “2004 Directors Option Plan”). The 2004 Directors Option Plan is administered by the Company’s Board of Directors. The 2004 Directors Option Plan expired in May 2014, except that its terms continue with respect to any outstanding options granted thereunder. Options were last granted under the 2004 Directors Option Plan in May 2011. Options granted under the 2004 Directors Option Plan are fully vested and are generally exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant.  
 Table of Contents  
 As of March 31, 2019, the total compensation cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized was approximately $127.3 with a weighted average expected amortization period of 3.25 years.  
 The grant-date fair value of each option grant under the 2009 Employee Option Plan, the 2017 Employee Option Plan and the 2004 Directors Option Plan is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The grant-date fair value of each share grant is determined based on the closing share price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of the grant. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model for option grants requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected share price volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the Common Stock and implied volatility derived from related exchange traded options. The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option and expected exercise and historical post-vesting termination experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issuances with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share is based on the Company’s dividend rate.

 Restricted Shares  
 In 2012, the Company adopted the 2012 Restricted Stock Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the “2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan”). The 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan is administered by the Company’s Board of Directors. As of March 31, 2019, the number of restricted shares available for grant under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan was 109,150. Restricted shares granted under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan generally vest on the first anniversary of the grant date. Grants under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan entitle the holder to receive shares of the Company’s Common Stock without payment.  
 As of March 31, 2019, the total compensation cost related to non-vested restricted shares not yet recognized was approximately $0.2 with a weighted average expected amortization period of 0.14 years.  
 Note 10—Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits  
 In January 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 to fund the U.S. Plans. This voluntary cash contribution made in the first quarter of 2018 was reflected as cash used in operating activities within Net change in accrued pension and postretirement benefits in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. The timing and amount of cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of the Plans’ assets.   
 The Company offers various defined contribution plans for certain U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements. Through 2018, the Company matched the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company increased its matching of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans to a maximum of 6% of eligible compensation. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company provided matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans of approximately $4.0 and $2.3, respectively.

 In January 2019, pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on November 27, 2018, the Company acquired SSI Controls Technologies (“SSI”), the sensor manufacturing division of SSI Technologies, Inc., for approximately $397, net of cash acquired (subject to customary post-closing adjustments), plus a performance-related contingent payment. SSI, which is headquartered in the United States (Wisconsin), is a leading designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensing solutions for the global automotive and industrial markets. The acquisition of SSI is not material to the Company. The contingent consideration payment is based on certain 2019 revenue and profitability levels of SSI. The Company determined the fair value of this liability using Level 3 unobservable inputs, such as probability weighted payout projections, and is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 16). The contingent consideration is payable in 2020 and recorded in Other accrued expenses on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2019.  
 Note 12—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  
 The increase in goodwill, net of foreign currency translation, during the first three months of 2019 is primarily due to the acquisition of SSI in January 2019, which is included in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment.  
 Intangible assets are included in Intangibles, net and other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The increase in the carrying amounts of intangible assets during the first quarter of 2019 
 Table of Contents  
was primarily due to intangible assets acquired as a result of the SSI acquisition. The amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $24.8 and $11.9, respectively. The amortization expense during the first three months of 2019 includes $12.5 related to the amortization of acquired backlog. As of March 31, 2019, amortization expense relating to the Company’s current intangible assets estimated for the remainder of 2019 is approximately $35.1 and for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately $41.8 in 2020, $37.1 in 2021, $29.7 in 2022, $27.0 in 2023 and $23.9 in 2024.  
 On January 15, 2019, the Company amended its $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “2016 Revolving Credit Facility”) with a $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility (“2019 Revolving Credit Facility”). The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the lenders’ aggregate commitments by $500.0 and, consistent with the previous 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company may utilize the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The carrying value of any borrowings under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility would approximate their fair value due primarily to their market interest rates and would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 16). The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At March 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.  
 The Company has a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (“U.S. Commercial Paper” or “USCP Notes”) in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”). The maturities of the USCP Notes vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The USCP Notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at par or a discount therefrom, and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. The average interest rate on the U.S. Commercial Paper as of March 31, 2019 was 2.64%.   
 The Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) also has a euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the 
 Table of Contents  
“Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The maturities of the ECP Notes will vary, but may not exceed 183 days from the date of issue. The ECP Notes are sold under customary terms in the euro-commercial paper market and may be issued at par or a discount therefrom or a premium thereto and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. Dollars or other currencies. As of March 31, 2019, the amount of ECP Notes outstanding was €65.0 (approximately $72.9), with an average interest rate of (0.10)%.   
 U.S. Senior Notes  
 On January 9, 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029 at 99.904% of face value (the “2029 Senior Notes”). The 2029 Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on the 2029 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2029 Senior Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to March 1, 2029, a make-whole premium.  In January 2019, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2029 Senior Notes, along with borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay $750.0 of 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.  
 All of the Company’s outstanding senior notes in the United States (“U.S. Senior Notes”) are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes at any time subject to certain terms and conditions, which include paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase and, with certain exceptions, a make-whole premium. The fair value of each series of U.S. Senior Notes is based on recent bid prices in an active market and is therefore classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 16). The U.S. Senior Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants. At March 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its U.S. Senior Notes.  
 On October 8, 2018, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $574.6) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 at 99.498% of face value (the “2028 Euro Notes” or “2.000% Euro Senior Notes”) and collectively with the U.S. Senior Notes, “Senior Notes”). The 2028 Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. Interest on the 2028 Euro Notes is payable annually on October 8 of each year, commencing on October 8, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2028 Euro Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to July 8, 2028, a make-whole premium. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to 
 Table of Contents  
repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. The 2028 Euro Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants. At March 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its 2028 Euro Notes.  
 Amphenol is a lessee of buildings, office space, automobiles and equipment throughout the world, nearly all of which are classified as operating leases expiring at various dates. The Company determines if an arrangement qualifies as a lease at lease inception. The Company adopted Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019. Operating lease liabilities are recorded based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term, assessed as of the commencement date. The Company’s real estate leases, which are comprised primarily of manufacturing facilities, warehouses and sales offices, represent the vast majority of our operating lease liabilities and generally have a lease term between 2 and 12 years. The remaining leases consist primarily of machinery and equipment used in production, office equipment and vehicles, each with various lease terms. The vast majority of our leases are comprised of fixed lease payments, with a small percentage of the Company’s real estate leases including lease payments tied to a rate or index which may be subject to variability. Certain real estate leases also include executory costs such as common area maintenance (non-lease component), as well as property insurance and property taxes (non-components). As a practical expedient permitted under Topic 842, we have elected to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for our real estate leases. Lease payments, which may include lease components, non-lease components and 
 Table of Contents  
non-components, are included in the measurement of the Company’s lease liabilities to the extent that such payments are either fixed amounts or variable amounts based on a rate or index (fixed in substance) as stipulated in the lease contract. Any actual costs in excess of such amounts are expensed as incurred as variable lease cost.   
 Substantially all of our lease agreements do not specify an implicit borrowing rate, and as such, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate by lease term, in order to calculate the present value of our future lease payments. The discount rate represents a risk-adjusted rate on a secured basis, and is the rate at which the Company would borrow funds to satisfy the scheduled lease liability payment streams commensurate with the lease term. On January 1, 2019, the discount rate used on existing leases at adoption was determined based on the remaining lease term using available data as of that date. For new or renewed leases starting in 2019, the discount rate is determined using available data at lease commencement and based on the lease term including any reasonably certain renewal periods.   
 Operating Leases  
 Table of Contents  
 Prior to January 1, 2019, the Company accounted for its leases in accordance with Topic 840, Leases. At December 31, 2018, the Company was committed under operating leases for buildings, office space, automobiles and equipment, which expired at various dates. As previously disclosed in our 2018 Annual Report and under previous lease accounting guidance, future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2018 totaled $197.3, comprised of $70.5 for 2019, $39.0 for 2020, $25.9 for 2021, $16.5 for 2022, $11.9 for 2023, and $33.5 for the years beyond 2023.  
 In rare circumstances, the Company may enter into finance leases for specific equipment used in manufacturing, in which the Company takes ownership of the asset upon the end of the lease. The Company records its finance leases within Property, plant and equipment, Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s finance leases and related depreciation and interest expense, cash flows and impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements were not material individually or in the aggregate as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2019.  
 Fair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. These requirements establish market or observable inputs as the preferred source of values. Assumptions based on hypothetical transactions are used in the absence of market inputs. The Company does not have any non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.

 Three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018  
 Net sales were $1,958.5 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $1,866.9 in the first quarter of 2018, which represented an increase of 5% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 5% organically over the same respective prior year period. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2019 increased 5% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 5% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2018. The sales growth was driven by increases in the information technology and data communications, industrial, military, commercial aerospace and mobile networks markets, arising primarily from organic growth along with contributions from the Company’s acquisitions, which was partially offset by a decrease in the mobile device market and a small decrease in the automotive market. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2019, which primarily serves the broadband market, decreased 1% in U.S. dollars, while increasing 2% in constant currencies and 2% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2018.  
 Table of Contents  
   (2)    Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year period(s) compared to the same period(s) in the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior periods from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior period net sales.   
   (3)    Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section. 
 Geographically, sales in the United States in the first quarter of 2019 increased approximately 10% in U.S. dollars ($578.9 in 2019 versus $527.0 in 2018) and 5% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2018. Foreign sales in the first quarter of 2019 increased approximately 3% in U.S. dollars ($1,379.6 in 2019 versus $1,339.9 in 2018), 6% in constant currencies and 4% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2018. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar for the first quarter of 2019 had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $46.6, compared to the same period in 2018.   
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $235.1 or 12.0% of net sales for the first quarter of 2019, compared to $230.0 or 12.3% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018. Administrative expenses represented approximately 4.5% of net sales for the first quarter of 2019 and represented approximately 5.0% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018. Research and development expenses represented approximately 3.0% of net sales for the first quarter of 2019 and represented 2.8% of net sales for first quarter of 2018. Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.5% of net sales for the first quarter of 2019 and represented approximately 4.5% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018.   
 Operating income was $376.2 or 19.2% of net sales for the first quarter of 2019, compared to $376.9 or 20.2% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018. Operating income for the first three months of 2019 included $16.5 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) comprised of the amortization of $12.5 related to the value associated with acquired backlog from the SSI acquisition, as well as external transaction costs of $4.0. These expenses had the effect of decreasing net income by $13.2 or $0.04 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was $392.7 or 20.1% of net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the first quarter of 2019 was $410.0 or 22.0% of net sales compared to $391.1 or 22.1% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018. Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the first quarter of 2019 was $10.5 or 10.9% of net sales, compared to $11.3 or 11.7% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the first quarter of 2019, compared to the same respective period of 2018, was primarily driven by product mix.  
 Interest expense for the first quarter of 2019 was $29.7, compared to $24.5 for the first quarter of 2018. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher average debt levels, along with higher average interest rates on the Company’s U.S. commercial paper borrowings as well as the new 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes issuance in January 2019. 
 Table of Contents  
The borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and net proceeds from the 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes were used to repay the Company’s 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes in January 2019.   
 Provision for income taxes for the first quarter of 2019 was at an effective tax rate of 22.8%, compared to 24.4% for the first quarter of 2018. For the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the table below. The effective tax rate was further impacted by the effect of acquisition-related expenses during the first quarter of 2019, as noted in the table below. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 2, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was 24.5% and 25.5%, respectively, as reconciled in the tables below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. Refer to Note 14 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to income taxes.  
 At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $987.6 and $1,291.7, respectively. The majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 is located outside of the United States.   
 Table of Contents  
 The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the Commercial Paper Programs, and the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the recent issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes in January 2019, discussed further within this Item 2) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months.  
 The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the Transition Tax (which is payable in annual installments until 2025), taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings), and funding of pension obligations. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company’s Senior Notes, the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Programs (all as defined below). The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions.  
 Cash Flow Summary  
 Operating Activities  
 In the first three months of 2019, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $22.7, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to decreases in accounts payable of $113.4 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $91.3, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of $160.8 and inventories of $31.7. In the first three months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $133.3, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $99.3 and $65.5, respectively, and an increase in inventories of $55.8, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $118.3.  
 The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. Accounts receivable decreased $129.9 to $1,661.9, primarily due to lower sales in the first quarter of 2019 relative to the fourth quarter of 2018, partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at March 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 (“Translation”) and the impact of the SSI acquisition in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that 
 Table of Contents  
closed in January 2019. Days sales outstanding at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were approximately 78 and 73 days, respectively.  Inventories decreased $9.4 to $1,224.4, primarily due to lower inventory levels resulting from lower sales activity, partially offset by Translation and the impact of the SSI acquisition. Inventory days at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were 84 and 74 days, respectively. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $56.2 to $932.0, primarily due to capital expenditures of $74.5 and the impact of the SSI acquisition, partially offset by depreciation of $59.4. Goodwill increased $336.7 to $4,439.9, primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to the SSI acquisition, which was partially offset by Translation. Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $214.4 to $708.7, primarily due to (i) the adoption of the new lease standard (“Topic 842”) described in Note 15 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which resulted in the recognition of $179.6 of operating lease right-of-use assets as of March 31, 2019 and (ii) the recognition of certain intangible assets related to the SSI acquisition, partially offset by (iii) the amortization of $24.8 related to the Company’s intangible assets. Accounts payable decreased $93.4 to $797.1, primarily due to less purchasing activity resulting from lower sales activity, partially offset by the impact from the SSI acquisition and Translation. Payable days at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were approximately 55 and 53 days, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $49.6 to $846.1, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $62.7 of current operating lease liabilities as of March 31, 2019, which was partially offset by certain tax payments. Other long-term liabilities increased $114.6 to $391.8, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of approximately $117.4 of long-term operating lease liabilities as of March 31, 2019.  
 There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution to fund the Company’s U.S. Plans of approximately $81.0.  
 In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. The increase in Free Cash Flow is primarily driven by an increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above, which was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures to support certain new customer programs.  
 Investing Activities  
 Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, net sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, and acquisitions.   
 Net cash used in investing activities was $475.1 in the first quarter of 2019, compared to $142.3 in the first quarter of 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $399.3 in cash to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $70.2, and net purchases of short-term investments of $5.6. In the first quarter of 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $99.5 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $54.1, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $11.3.

 Financing Activities  
 Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments and purchases of and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests.   
 Net cash used in financing activities was $181.6 in the first quarter of 2019, compared to $728.2 in the first quarter of 2018. For the first quarter of 2019, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by the repayment of the Company’s 2.55% Senior Notes due January 2019 and other debt of $757.2, repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $160.0, dividend payments of $68.7, payments of costs of $6.9 related to debt financing primarily associated with the January 2019 issuance of the 4.350% U.S. senior notes (“2029 Senior Notes”) and the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility (defined below), and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $3.2, partially offset by net cash proceeds from the January 2019 issuance of the 2029 Senior Notes of $499.5, net borrowings related to the Company’s commercial paper programs of $267.4 and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $47.5. For the first quarter of 2018, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $382.0, net repayments of long-term debt of $304.8, dividend payments of $58.1 and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $3.9, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $20.6.   
 The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity. The Company’s debt financing includes the use of commercial paper programs, revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.  
 On January 15, 2019, the Company amended its $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “2016 Revolving Credit Facility”) with a $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility (“2019 Revolving Credit Facility”). The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the lenders’ aggregate commitments by $500.0 and, consistent with the previous 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company may utilize the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At March 31, 2019, there were no borrowings under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At March 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.  
 Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. commercial paper program, the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”). The amount of U.S. commercial paper notes outstanding (“USCP Notes”) as of March 31, 2019 was $815.7.   
 Pursuant to the terms of the euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”), the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, the “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. Dollars or other currencies. The amount of ECP Notes outstanding as of March 31, 2019 was €65.0 (approximately $72.9).

 The U.S. Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions. In January 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029, the net proceeds of which were used, along with proceeds from borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the $750.0 of the Company’s 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.   
 On October 8, 2018, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $574.6) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 at 99.498% of face value (the “2028 Euro Notes”). The 2028 Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. Interest on the 2028 Euro Notes is payable annually on October 8 of each year, commencing on October 8, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2028 Euro Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to July 8, 2028, a make-whole premium. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.    
 The Company’s Senior Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants. Refer to Note 13 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.

the foreign currencies for which such borrowings are made. In addition, any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over LIBOR, while any borrowings under the Commercial Paper Programs are subject to floating interest rates. Therefore, when the Company borrows under these debt instruments, the Company is exposed to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates. As of March 31, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, while borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program were at an average floating rate of 2.64% and (0.10)%, respectively. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2019, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly.
