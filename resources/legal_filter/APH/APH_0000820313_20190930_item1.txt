Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
On January 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 842 using the updated modified retrospective transition approach allowed under ASU 2018-11 and did not restate prior periods. The Company recognized ROU assets and related lease liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2019 of approximately $180 related to our operating lease commitments, and there was no cumulative impact on retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. Topic 842 did not 
Disaggregation of Net Sales
Net sales by geographic area are based on the customer location to which the product is shipped.
Note 6—Shareholders’ Equity and Noncontrolling Interests
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is classified below net income. Earnings per share is determined after the impact of the noncontrolling interests’ share in net income of the Company. In addition, the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests is presented as a separate caption within equity.
On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 1.7 million and 6.1 million shares of its Common Stock for $150.0 and $558.7, respectively, under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases during the first nine months of 2019, 1.0 million shares, or $87.6, have been retained in Treasury stock; the remaining 5.1 million shares, or $471.1, have been retired by the Company. The Company has not repurchased any additional shares of its Common Stock from October 1, 2019 to October 22, 2019, and has remaining authorization to purchase up to $888.1 of its Common Stock under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.
January 24, 2019 (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $382.0 under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, bringing total repurchases under this program to 12.6 million shares or $1,000.0, thus completing the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program. These repurchases in the first quarter of 2018, coupled with the Company’s repurchase of 3.5 million shares of its Common Stock for $298.2 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program during the six months ended September 30, 2018, resulted in total repurchases of 7.7 million shares for $680.2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
On July 23, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.23 to $0.25 per share effective with dividends declared in the third quarter of 2019.
Note 7—Earnings Per Share
Excluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive common shares of 12.2 million and 6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluded from the computations above were anti-dilutive common shares of 8.6 million and 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In August 2018, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Inspector General, requesting documents pertaining to certain products manufactured by the Company’s Military and Aerospace Group that are purchased or used by the U.S. government. The Company is cooperating with the request. The inquiry remains in the early stages and the Company is unable to estimate the timing or outcome of the matter.
Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
For the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s income before income taxes was reduced for stock-based compensation expense of $16.6 and $14.4, respectively. In addition, for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized aggregate income tax benefits of $3.6 and $8.9, respectively, in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income associated with stock-based compensation, which include the excess tax benefits from option exercises of $1.6 and $7.0, respectively. 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s income before income taxes was reduced for stock-based compensation expense of $46.4 and $40.4, respectively. In addition, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized aggregate income tax benefits of $27.1 and $19.7, respectively, in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income associated with stock-based compensation, which include the excess tax benefits from option exercises of $21.3 and $14.1, respectively. 
Stock Options
In May 2017, the Company adopted the 2017 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries (the “2017 Employee Option Plan”). A committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has been authorized to grant stock options pursuant to the 2017 Employee Option Plan. The number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (“Common Stock”) reserved for issuance under the 2017 Employee Option Plan is 30,000,000 shares. As of September 30, 2019, there were 10,943,910 shares of Common Stock available for the granting of additional stock options under the 2017 Employee Option Plan. The Company also continues to maintain the 2009 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries, as amended (the “2009 Employee Option Plan”). No additional stock options will be granted under the 2009 Employee Option Plan. Options granted under the 2017 Employee Option Plan and the 2009 Employee Option Plan generally vest ratably over a period of five years from the date of grant and are generally exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant.  
In 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Stock Option Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the “2004 Directors Option Plan”). The 2004 Directors Option Plan is administered by the Company’s Board of Directors. The 2004 Directors Option Plan expired in May 2014, except that its terms continue with respect to any outstanding options granted thereunder. Options were last granted under the 2004 Directors Option Plan in May 2011. Options granted 
under the 2004 Directors Option Plan are fully vested and are generally exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant.
As of September 30, 2019, the total compensation cost related to non-vested options not yet recognized was approximately $167.0 with a weighted average expected amortization period of 3.54 years.
The grant-date fair value of each option grant under the 2009 Employee Option Plan, the 2017 Employee Option Plan and the 2004 Directors Option Plan is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The grant-date fair value of each share grant is determined based on the closing share price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of the grant. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model for option grants requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected share price volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the Common Stock and implied volatility derived from related exchange traded options. The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option and expected exercise and historical experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issuances with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share is based on the Company’s dividend rate.
Restricted Shares
In 2012, the Company adopted the 2012 Restricted Stock Plan for Directors of Amphenol Corporation (the “2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan”). The 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan is administered by the Company’s Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2019, the number of restricted shares available for grant under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan was 94,846. Restricted shares granted under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan generally vest on the first anniversary of the grant date. Grants under the 2012 Directors Restricted Stock Plan entitle the holder to receive shares of the Company’s Common Stock without payment.
Note 10—Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits
In January 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 to fund the U.S. Plans. This voluntary cash contribution made in the first quarter of 2018 was reflected as cash used in operating activities within Net change in accrued pension and postretirement benefits in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future. 
The Company offers various defined contribution plans for certain U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements. Through 2018, the Company matched the majority of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company increased its matching of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans to a maximum of 6% of eligible compensation. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company provided matching contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans of approximately $9.8 and $6.2, respectively.
In January 2019, pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on November 27, 2018, the Company acquired SSI Controls Technologies (“SSI”), the sensor manufacturing division of SSI Technologies, Inc., for approximately $397, net of cash acquired (subject to customary post-closing adjustments), plus a performance-related contingent payment. SSI, which is headquartered in the United States (Wisconsin), is a leading designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensing solutions for the global automotive and industrial markets. The acquisition of SSI is not material to the Company. The contingent consideration payment is based on certain 2019 revenue and profitability levels of SSI. The Company determined the fair value of this liability using Level 3 unobservable inputs, such as probability weighted payout projections, and is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 16). The contingent consideration is payable in 2020 and recorded in Other accrued expenses on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2019.
During the first nine months of 2019, the Company completed eight acquisitions (including SSI) for $891.2, net of cash acquired. All but one of the acquisitions are included in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. The Company is in the process of completing its analyses of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The 
During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company incurred approximately $25.4 ($21.0 after-tax) of acquisition-related expenses, primarily comprised of the amortization of $15.7 related to the value associated with acquired backlog (of which $12.5 related to the SSI acquisition), with the remainder representing external transaction costs. Such acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
Note 12—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The increase in goodwill, net of foreign currency translation, during the first nine months of 2019 is due to the Company’s acquisitions during this period.
The Company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units as of each July 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that a reporting unit’s carrying amount may be impaired. The Company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “Interconnect Products and Assemblies” and “Cable Products and Solutions”, as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics. In 2019, as part of our annual evaluation, the Company utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment. As part of this assessment, the Company reviews qualitative factors which include, but are not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, as well as the financial performance of each reporting unit. In accordance with applicable guidance, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit if, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that its reporting unit’s fair value is greater than its carrying amount. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts and therefore, a quantitative assessment was not required. There has been no goodwill impairment in 2019, 2018 or 2017 in connection with our impairment tests.
Intangible assets are included in Intangibles, net and other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The increase in the carrying amounts of intangible assets during the first nine months of 2019 was primarily due to intangible assets acquired as a result of the SSI acquisition, along with the other acquisitions 
closed during the period. The amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $13.6 and $11.6, respectively. The amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $54.0 and $35.4, respectively. Amortization expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 includes $15.7 related to the amortization of acquired backlog, primarily associated with the SSI acquisition. As of September 30, 2019, amortization expense relating to the Company’s current intangible assets estimated for the remainder of 2019 is approximately $13.1 and for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately $48.4 in 2020, $43.8 in 2021, $36.6 in 2022, $33.9 in 2023 and $28.8 in 2024.
On January 15, 2019, the Company amended its $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “2016 Revolving Credit Facility”) with a $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility (“2019 Revolving Credit Facility”). The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the lenders’ aggregate commitments by $500.0 and, consistent with the previous 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company may utilize the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The carrying value of any borrowings under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility would approximate their fair value due primarily to their market interest rates and would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 16). The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility.
The Company has a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (“U.S. Commercial Paper” or “USCP Notes”) in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”). The maturities of the USCP Notes vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The USCP Notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be issued at par or a discount therefrom, and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. The average interest rate on the U.S. Commercial Paper as of September 30, 2019 was 2.29%. 
The Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) also has a euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The maturities of the ECP Notes will vary, but may not exceed 183 days from the date of issue.  The ECP Notes are sold under customary terms in the euro-commercial paper market and may be issued at par or a discount therefrom or a premium thereto and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. Dollars or other currencies. As of September 30, 2019, the amount of ECP Notes outstanding was €255.0 (approximately $277.9), with an average interest rate of (0.12)%. 
On January 9, 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029 at 99.904% of face value (the “2029 Senior Notes”). The 2029 Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on the 2029 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2019. Prior to March 1, 2029, the Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2029 Senior Notes at any time by paying a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount thereof or a make-whole premium, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption, and if redeemed on or after March 1, 2029, the Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2029 Senior Notes at any time by paying a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. In January 2019, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2029 Senior Notes, along with borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay $750.0 of 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.  
On September 4, 2019, the Company commenced tender offers (“Tender Offers”) to purchase for cash any and all of the Company’s outstanding (i) $375.0 principal amount of its 3.125% Senior Notes due September 2021 (“2021 Senior Notes”) and (ii) $500.0 principal amount of its 4.00% Senior Notes due February 2022 (“2022 Senior Notes”). On September 11, 2019, as a result of the Tender Offers, the Company accepted for payment $147.3 aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes and $205.0 aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Senior Notes for 101.9% and 104.5% of par value, respectively (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”), plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not 
including, the settlement date of the Tender Offers. The total consideration for the Tendered Notes was $368.8, which in addition to the Tendered Notes, included $13.4 of premiums and fees paid related to the early extinguishment of debt and $3.1 of accrued interest. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company recorded a loss on early debt extinguishment of $14.3 ($12.5 after-tax, or $0.04 per diluted share) within Loss on early extinguishment of debt on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. This charge is primarily comprised of the premiums and fees incurred related to the Tendered Notes, along with the non-cash charge associated with the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred debt issuance costs associated with the Tendered Notes. The remaining principal amounts associated with the 2021 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes, which were not redeemed as a result of the Tender Offers, remain outstanding as of September 30, 2019, as noted in the table above.
On September 10, 2019, the Company issued $900.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.800% Senior Notes due February 15, 2030 at 99.920% of face value (the “2030 Senior Notes”). The 2030 Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on the 2030 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2020. Prior to November 15, 2029, the Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2030 Senior Notes at any time by paying a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount thereof or a make-whole premium, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption, and if redeemed on or after November 15, 2029, the Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2030 Senior Notes at any time by paying a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. In September 2019, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2030 Senior Notes to fund the cash consideration payable in the Tender Offers, with the remaining net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes, including to partially reduce outstanding borrowings related to the U.S. Commercial Paper Program.  
All of the Company’s outstanding senior notes in the United States (“U.S. Senior Notes”) are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes at any time subject to certain terms and conditions, which include paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase and, with certain exceptions, a make-whole premium. The fair value of each series of U.S. Senior Notes is based on recent bid prices in an active market and is therefore classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 16). The Company’s 2.20% Senior Notes are due in April 2020 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2019. The U.S. Senior Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants. At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its U.S. Senior Notes.
On October 8, 2018, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $574.6 at date of issuance) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 at 99.498% of face value (the “2028 Euro Notes” or “2.000% Euro Senior Notes”) and collectively with the U.S. Senior Notes, “Senior Notes”). The 2028 Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. Interest on the 2028 Euro Notes is payable annually on October 8 of each year, commencing on October 8, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2028 Euro Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to July 8, 2028, a make-whole premium.  The fair value of the 2028 Euro Notes is based on recent bid prices in an active market and is therefore classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy (Note 16). The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.  The 2028 Euro Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants. At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its 2028 Euro Notes.
For the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering our Provision for income taxes by approximately $1.6 and $7.0, respectively, and lowering our effective tax rate by approximately 40 basis points and 170 basis points, respectively, due to the recognition of excess tax benefits within Provision for income taxes in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering our Provision for income taxes by approximately $21.3 and $14.1, respectively, and lowering our effective tax rate by approximately 190 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, the loss on early extinguishment of debt also had the effect of increasing the effective tax rate by approximately 40 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively.
Amphenol is a lessee of buildings, office space, automobiles and equipment throughout the world, nearly all of which are classified as operating leases expiring at various dates. The Company determines if an arrangement qualifies as a lease at lease inception. The Company adopted Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019. Operating lease liabilities are recorded based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term, assessed as of the commencement date. The Company’s real estate leases, which are comprised primarily of manufacturing facilities, warehouses and sales offices, represent the vast majority of our operating lease liabilities and generally have a lease term between 2 and 12 years. The remaining leases consist primarily of machinery and equipment used in production, office equipment and vehicles, each with various lease terms. The vast majority of our leases are comprised of fixed lease payments, with a small percentage of the Company’s real estate leases including lease payments tied to a rate or index which may be subject to variability. Certain real estate leases also include executory costs such as common area maintenance (non-lease component), as well as property insurance and property taxes (non-components). As a practical expedient permitted under Topic 842, we have elected to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease 
component for our real estate leases. Lease payments, which may include lease components, non-lease components and non-components, are included in the measurement of the Company’s lease liabilities to the extent that such payments are either fixed amounts or variable amounts based on a rate or index (fixed in substance) as stipulated in the lease contract. Any actual costs in excess of such amounts are expensed as incurred as variable lease cost. 
Substantially all of our lease agreements do not specify an implicit borrowing rate, and as such, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate by lease term, in order to calculate the present value of our future lease payments. The discount rate represents a risk-adjusted rate on a secured basis, and is the rate at which the Company would borrow funds to satisfy the scheduled lease liability payment streams commensurate with the lease term. On January 1, 2019, the discount rate used on existing leases at adoption was determined based on the remaining lease term using available data as of that date. For new or renewed leases starting in 2019, the discount rate is determined using available data at lease commencement and based on the lease term including any reasonably certain renewal periods. 
Operating Leases
Lease contracts that we have executed but which have not yet commenced as of September 30, 2019 were not material, and are excluded from the tables above. The Company does not generally enter into leases involving the construction or design of the underlying asset, and nearly all of the assets we lease are not specialized in nature. Our lease agreements generally do not include residual value guarantees nor do we enter into sublease arrangements with external parties.
Prior to January 1, 2019, the Company accounted for its leases in accordance with Topic 840, Leases. At December 31, 2018, the Company was committed under operating leases for buildings, office space, automobiles and equipment, which expired at various dates. As previously disclosed in our 2018 Annual Report and under previous lease accounting guidance, future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2018 totaled $197.3, comprised of $70.5 for 2019, $39.0 for 2020, $25.9 for 2021, $16.5 for 2022, $11.9 for 2023, and $33.5 for the years beyond 2023.
In rare circumstances, the Company may enter into finance leases for specific equipment used in manufacturing, in which the Company takes ownership of the asset upon the end of the lease. The Company records its finance leases within Property, plant and equipment, Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s finance leases and related depreciation and interest expense, cash flows and impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements were not material individually or in the aggregate as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.
Fair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. These requirements establish market or observable inputs as the preferred source of values. Assumptions based on hypothetical transactions are used in the absence of market inputs. The Company does not have any non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.
Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 3 Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.
With the exception of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisition accounting, the Company does not have any other significant financial or non-financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
Three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018
Net sales were $2,100.6 in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $2,129.0 in the third quarter of 2018, which represented a decrease of 1% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically, and flat in constant currencies over the same respective prior year period. Net sales were $6,074.4 in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $5,977.3 in the first nine months of 2018, which represented an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 4% in constant currencies, while decreasing 1% organically over the same respective prior year period. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2019 decreased 1% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically, and were flat in constant currencies compared to the third quarter of 2018. The decline in sales for the third quarter of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by moderations in mobile devices, information technology and data communications, broadband communications, and mobile networks markets, offset in part by growth in the military, commercial aerospace, industrial and automotive markets, including contributions from the Company’s acquisition program. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the first nine months of 2019 increased 2% in U.S. dollars and 4% in constant currencies, while decreasing 1% organically, compared to the first nine months of 2018. The sales growth in the first nine months of 2019 relative to the same period of 2018 was driven by growth in the military, commercial aerospace, mobile networks, industrial and automotive markets, including contributions from the Company’s acquisition program, offset in part by moderations in the mobile devices, broadband communications, and information technology and data communications markets. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2019, which primarily serves the broadband communications market, decreased 9% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 10% 
organically, compared to the third quarter of 2018. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales) in the first nine months of 2019 decreased 10% in U.S. dollars, 8% in constant currencies and 9% organically, compared to the first nine months of 2018. The decrease in net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was primarily due to a reduction in demand at broadband service providers.
Geographically, sales in the United States in the third quarter of 2019 increased approximately 17% in U.S. dollars ($667.9 in 2019 versus $572.0 in 2018) and 5% organically, compared to the third quarter of 2018, and increased approximately 12% in U.S. dollars ($1,879.6 in 2019 versus $1,675.3 in 2018) and 4% organically in the first nine months of 2019, compared to the first nine months of 2018. Foreign sales in the third quarter of 2019 decreased approximately 8% in U.S. dollars ($1,432.7 in 2019 versus $1,557.0 in 2018), 7% in constant currencies and 10% organically, compared to the third quarter of 2018, and decreased approximately 2% in U.S. dollars ($4,194.8 in 2019 versus $4,302.0 in 2018) and 3% organically, while remaining flat in constant currencies in the first nine months of 2019, compared to the first nine months of 2018. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $23.6 and $112.2, respectively, compared to the same respective periods in 2018. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $248.3 or 11.8% of net sales and $722.5 or 11.9% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, compared to $244.0 or 11.5% of net sales and $710.6 or 11.9% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. Administrative expenses represented approximately 4.8% and 4.7% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, and represented approximately 4.6% and 4.8% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. Research and development expenses represented approximately 2.8% and 2.9% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, and represented approximately 2.6% and 2.7% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.2% and 4.4% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, and represented approximately 4.2% and 4.4% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. 
Operating income was $413.6 or 19.7% of net sales and $1,189.4 or 19.6% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively, compared to $444.2 or 20.9% of net sales and $1,229.3 or 20.6% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. Operating income for the first nine months of 2019 included $25.4 of acquisition-related expenses (separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) comprised of the amortization of $15.7 related to the value associated with acquired backlog from two acquisitions, as well as external transaction costs of $9.7. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, these acquisition-related expenses had the effect of decreasing net income by $21.0 or $0.07 per share. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was $1,214.8 or 20.0% of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was $433.9 or 21.7% of net sales and $1,272.4 or 22.0% of net sales, respectively, compared to $458.1 or 22.7% and $1,268.9 or 22.4% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. The slight decrease in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, compared to the same respective periods in 2018, was primarily driven by normal downside conversion related to the organic decline in sales as well as the impact of recent acquisitions which currently have, on average, a lower operating margin than the average of the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for such periods. Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was $10.2 or 10.2% of net sales and $29.3 or 10.3% of net sales, respectively, compared to $14.4 or 13.1% of net sales and $40.4 or 12.7% of net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, compared to the same respective periods in 2018, was primarily driven by lower volumes and product mix.
Interest expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was $29.7 and $89.5, respectively, compared to $24.8 and $75.3 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively.  The increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher average interest rates on the Company’s U.S. commercial paper borrowings and the 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes issuance in January 2019, along with higher average debt levels. Certain borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program and net proceeds from the 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes were used to repay the Company’s 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes in January 2019. 
Loss on early extinguishment of debt for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was $14.3. The loss on early extinguishment of debt incurred during the third quarter of 2019 was related to refinancing-related costs, specifically premiums and fees incurred associated with the early extinguishment of certain redeemed principal amounts of the 3.125% Senior Notes and 4.00% Senior Notes (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”) as a result of the tender offers in September 2019. Refer to Note 13 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section within this Item 2 for further information related to the Tendered Notes. 
Provision for income taxes for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was at an effective tax rate of 24.5% and 22.9%, respectively. Provision for income taxes for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 was at an effective tax rate of 23.8% and 24.3%, respectively. For the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 and 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the tables below. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was further impacted by the tax effect of the refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt, while the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 was further impacted by the tax effects of both the acquisition-related expenses and the refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt, all as noted in the tables below. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 2, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was 24.5%, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was 25.5%, as reconciled in the tables below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. Refer to Note 14 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to income taxes.
Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) were $280.3 and $0.92, respectively, for the third quarter of 2019, compared to $316.6 and $1.01, respectively, for the third quarter of 2018. Excluding the effect of the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt in the third quarter of 2019, Adjusted Net Income 
At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $986.7 and $1,291.7, respectively. The majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 is located outside of the United States. 
The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the Commercial Paper Programs, and the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the issuances of the 2029 Senior Notes in January 2019 and the 2030 Senior Notes in September 2019, discussed further within this Item 2) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months.
The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the Transition Tax (which is payable in annual installments until 2025), taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings), and funding of pension obligations. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company’s Senior Notes, the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Programs (all as defined below). The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions.
Cash Flow Summary
Operating Activities
The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $1,078.2 in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $734.5 in the first nine months of 2018.  The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow”) for the first nine months of 2019 compared to the first nine months of 2018 is primarily related to a lower usage of cash related to the change in working capital. In addition, Operating Cash Flow for the first nine months of 2018 included the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 during that period to fund its U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”, and together with its foreign plans, the “Plans”), while no such voluntary cash contributions to the U.S. Plans were made in the first nine months of 2019. 
In the first nine months of 2019, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $27.1, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to decreases in accounts payable of $75.9 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $74.4, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $129.6. In the first nine months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $246.4, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to an increase in inventories of $184.2, accounts receivable of $182.5 and other current assets of $61.3, partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $150.8 and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $30.8.
The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. Accounts receivable decreased $102.7 to $1,689.1, primarily due to lower sales as well as the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at September 30, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 (“Translation”), partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Days sales outstanding at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were approximately 72 and 73 days, respectively.  Inventories increased $39.7 to $1,273.5, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by lower inventory levels resulting from lower sales activity and Translation. Inventory days at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were 79 and 74 days, respectively. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $89.4 to $965.2, primarily due to capital expenditures of $223.0 and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by depreciation of $178.1 and Translation. Goodwill increased $646.8 to $4,750.0, primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to acquisitions that closed during the first nine months of 2019, which was partially offset by Translation. Intangibles, net and other long-term assets increased $241.9 to $736.2, primarily due to (i) the adoption of the new lease standard (“Topic 842”) described in Note 15 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which resulted in the recognition of $185.5 of operating lease right-of-use assets as of September 30, 2019 and (ii) the recognition of certain intangible assets related to the SSI acquisition and other 2019 acquisitions, partially offset by (iii) the amortization of $54.0 related to the Company’s intangible assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Accounts payable decreased $59.8 to $830.7, primarily due to less purchasing activity resulting from lower sales activity and Translation, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Payable days at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 were approximately 52 and 53 days, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $91.7 to $888.2, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $53.6 of current operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2019, and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by certain tax payments. Other long-term liabilities, including deferred taxes, increased $95.7 to $628.5, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $132.9 of long-term operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2019, partially offset by a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities.
There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company made a voluntary cash contribution to fund the Company’s U.S. Plans of approximately $81.0.
In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. The increase in Free Cash Flow is driven by an increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above.
Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, net sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, and acquisitions. 
Net cash used in investing activities was $1,111.0 in the first nine months of 2019, compared to $350.3 in the first nine months of 2018. In the first nine months of 2019, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $891.2 in cash to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $215.9, and net purchases of short-term investments of $3.9. In the first nine months of 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $158.9 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $204.4, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $13.0. 
Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments, and distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests. 
Net cash used in financing activities was $246.4 in the first nine months of 2019, compared to $1,068.6 in the first nine months of 2018. For the first nine months of 2019, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by the aggregate repayments of certain of the Company’s senior notes and other long-term debt (primarily the 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes due January 2019 and the early extinguishment of the Tendered Notes in September 2019) of $1,111.2, repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $558.7, dividend payments of $205.5, distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $25.0, payments of costs of $14.9 related to debt financing primarily associated with the 2029 Senior Notes, the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, and the 2030 Senior Notes (each as defined below), and premiums and fees paid of $13.4 related to the early extinguishment of the Tendered Notes, partially offset by aggregate net cash proceeds from the issuances of the 2029 Senior Notes and the 2030 Senior Notes of $1,398.8, cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $146.3, and net borrowings related to the Company’s commercial paper programs of $137.2. For the first nine months of 2018, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $680.2, net repayments related to the Company’s commercial paper programs of $300.1, dividend payments of $184.4, distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $17.9 and repayments of other long-term debt of $8.7, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $123.0. 
The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity. The Company’s debt financing includes the use of commercial paper programs, revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy.
On January 15, 2019, the Company amended its $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the “2016 Revolving Credit Facility”) with a $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility (“2019 Revolving Credit Facility”). The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the lenders’ aggregate commitments by $500.0 and, consistent with the previous 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company may utilize the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2019, there were no borrowings under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2019 Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At September 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. commercial paper program, the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”). The amount of U.S. commercial paper notes outstanding (“USCP Notes”) as of September 30, 2019 was $475.8. 
Pursuant to the terms of the euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”), the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, the “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. Dollars or other currencies. The amount of ECP Notes outstanding as of September 30, 2019 was €255.0 (approximately $277.9). 
amounts undrawn under the Company’s 2019 Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay Commercial Paper, if necessary. Net proceeds of the issuances of Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of Commercial Paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future.
The U.S. Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions. 
On September 4, 2019, the Company commenced tender offers (“Tender Offers”) to purchase for cash any and all of the Company’s outstanding (i) $375.0 principal amount of its 3.125% Senior Notes due September 2021 (“2021 Senior Notes”) and (ii) $500.0 principal amount of its 4.00% Senior Notes due February 2022 (“2022 Senior Notes”). On September 11, 2019, as a result of the Tender Offers, the Company accepted for payment $147.3 aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes and $205.0 aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Senior Notes for 101.9% and 104.5% of par value, respectively (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”), plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the settlement date of the Tender Offers. The total consideration for the Tendered Notes was $368.8, which in addition to the Tendered Notes, included $13.4 of premiums and fees paid related to the early extinguishment of debt and $3.1 of accrued interest. The remaining principal amounts associated with the 2021 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes, which were not redeemed as a result of the Tender Offers, remain outstanding as of September 30, 2019. 
On September 10, 2019, the Company issued $900.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.800% Senior Notes due February 15, 2030 at 99.920% of face value (the “2030 Senior Notes”). In September 2019, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2030 Senior Notes to fund the cash consideration payable in the Tender Offers, with the remaining net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes, including to partially reduce outstanding borrowings related to the U.S. Commercial Paper Program.  
In January 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029 at 99.904% of face value (the “2029 Senior Notes”), the net proceeds of which were used, along with proceeds from borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the $750.0 of the Company’s 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019. 
On October 8, 2018, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $574.6 at date of issuance) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 at 99.498% of face value (the “2028 Euro Notes”). The 2028 Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. Interest on the 2028 Euro Notes is payable annually on October 8 of each year, commencing on October 8, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2028 Euro Notes at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase, and if redeemed prior to July 8, 2028, a make-whole premium. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes.  
The Company’s Senior Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants. Refer to Note 13 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.
On April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). During the three months ended September 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 1.7 million shares of its Common Stock for $150.0, while during the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 6.1 million shares of its Common Stock for $558.7, all under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases during the first nine months of 2019, 1.0 million shares, or $87.6, have been retained in Treasury stock; the remaining 5.1 million shares, or $471.1, have been retired by the Company. The Company has not repurchased any additional shares of its Common Stock from October 1, 2019 to October 22, 2019, and has remaining authorization to purchase up to $888.1 of its Common Stock under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price.
On January 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $382.0 under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, bringing total repurchases under this program to 12.6 million shares or $1,000.0, thus completing the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program. These repurchases in the first quarter of 2018, coupled with the Company’s repurchase of 3.5 million shares of its Common Stock for $298.2 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program during the six months ended September 30, 2018, resulted in total repurchases of 7.7 million shares for $680.2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.
On July 23, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.23 to $0.25 per share effective with dividends declared in the third quarter of 2019.
Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
