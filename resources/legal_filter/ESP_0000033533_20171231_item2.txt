 Item 2.
& Electronics Corp. (“Espey”) is a power electronics design and original equipment manufacturing with a long history of developing and delivering highly reliable products for use in military and severe environment applications.
Espey is classified as a “smaller reporting company” for purposes of the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Espey’s common stock is publicly-traded on the NYSE MKT under the symbol “ESP.” 



Espey began operations after incorporation in New York in 1928.
Espey is ISO 9001:2015 and AS9100:2016 certified.
Our primary products are power supplies, power converters, filters, power transformers, magnetic components, power distribution equipment, UPS systems, antennas and high power radar systems.
The applications of these products include AC and DC locomotives, shipboard power, shipboard radar, airborne power, ground-based radar, and ground mobile power.
Espey services include design and development to specification, build to print, design services, design studies, environmental testing services, metal fabrication, painting services, and development of automatic testing equipment.
Portions of the manufacturing and testing process are subcontracted to vendors from time to time.
The Company markets its products primarily through its own direct sales organization and through outside sales representatives.
In certain countries the Company has external sales representatives to help solicit and coordinate foreign contracts.
Espey is also on the eligible list of contractors with the United States Department of Defense and generally is automatically solicited by Defense Department procurement agencies for their needs falling within the major classes of products produced by the Company.
In addition, the Company directly pursues opportunities from the United States Department of Defense for prime contracts.
Espey contracts with the Federal Government under cage code 20950 as Espey Mfg.
& Electronics Corp.
There is competition in all classes of products manufactured by the Company from divisions of the largest electronic companies, as well as many small companies.
The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products.
Our business is not seasonal.
However, the concentration of our business in the rail industry, and in equipment for military applications and industrial applications and our customer concentrations expose us to on-going associated risks.
Uncertainty in federal defense spending and future procurement needs supporting the rail industry continues to drive competition.
Accordingly, we adjust our pricing strategy in order to achieve a balance which enables us both to retain repeat programs while being more competitive in bidding on new programs.
In order to maintain a balanced business, we are continuing to place an emphasis on securing “build to print” opportunities, which will allow production work to go directly to the manufacturing floor, limiting the impact on our engineering staff.

The total backlog at December 31, 2017 was approximately $38.4 million which includes $19.0 million from three significant customers compared to $38.2 million at December 31, 2016 which included $21.8 million from two significant customers.
The Company’s total backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts.
The funded portion of this backlog at December 31, 2017 is approximately $33.4 million.
This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by Congress and/or funded by the customer.
The unfunded backlog at December 31, 2017 is approximately $5.0 million and represents a firm multi-year order for which funding has not yet been appropriated by Congress or funded by our customer.
While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, management has included in unfunded backlog only those programs that it believes are likely to receive funding based on discussions with customers and program status.
The backlog was fully funded at December 31, 2016.
Management expects revenues in fiscal year 2018 to be higher than revenues during fiscal year 2017.
New orders received in the six months of fiscal year 2018 were approximately $14.3 million as compared to $10.9 million of new orders received in the first six months of fiscal year 2017.
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $13.5 million of orders comprising the December 31, 2017 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.
The minimum of $13.5 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.
The estimate of the December 31, 2017 backlog to be shipped in fiscal year 2018 is subject to future events, which may cause the amount of the backlog actually shipped to differ from such estimate.
In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding opportunities representing in excess of $69 million in the aggregate as of January 30, 2018 for both repeat and new programs.
The outstanding quotations encompass various new and previously manufactured power supplies, transformers, and subassemblies.
Net sales to three significant customers represented 63.2% of the Company’s total sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 and net sales to two significant customers represented 38.4% of the Company's total sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016.
Net sales to two significant customers represented 61.0% and 42.6% of the Company’s total sales for the six-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
This high concentration level with these customers presents significant risk.
Generally revenues on long-term fixed-price contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion.
Percentage of completion accounting requires judgment relative to expected sales, estimating costs and making assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedules.
The estimation of cost at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract.
Results of Operations 



Net sales increased for the three months ended December 31, 2017 to $11,531,105 as compared to $5,667,624 for the same period in 2016.
Net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2017 increased to $19,027,528 as compared to $11,736,308 for the same period in 2016.
For the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, the increase in net sales is primarily due to an increase in power supply sales resulting from the commencement of shipments on a new significant military contract in the current fiscal year.
This increase was offset, in part, by a decrease in magnetic shipments due to the timing and completion of specific contracts.

For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, gross profits were $3,075,598 and $1,080,145, respectively.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 26.7% and 19.1%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
For the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, gross profits were $4,536,752 and $2,423,892, respectively.
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 23.8% and 20.7%, for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are typically higher as compared to products which are still in the engineering development stage or in early stages of production.
In the case of the latter, the Company can incur what it refers to as “loss contracts,” meaning engineering design contracts in which the Company invests with the objective of developing future product sales.
The gross profit percentage increased in the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to product mix and a decrease in expenditures incurred related to engineering design investments.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $982,370 for the three months ended December 31, 2017; an increase of $231,989, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,861,190 for the six months ended December 31, 2017; an increase of $338,143 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2016.
Other income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, was $43,289 and $18,655, respectively.
Other income for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, was $84,685 and $37,678, respectively.
The increase for the three and six months is primarily due an increase in interest income resulting from the increase in investment securities.
Interest income is a function of the level of investments and investment strategies which generally tend to be conservative.
The Company’s effective tax rates for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, were 24.4% and 25.5%, respectively, compared to 29.9% and 29.2% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016.
The effective tax rate is less than the statutory tax rate mainly due to the benefit the Company receives on its “qualified production activities” under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and the benefit derived from the ESOP dividends paid on allocated shares.
Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017, was $1,614,871 or $0.69 per share both basic and diluted, respectively compared to $244,079 or $0.11 per share both basic and diluted, for the three months ended December 31, 2016.
Net income for the six months ended December 31, 2017, was $2,057,635 or $0.88 per share both basic and diluted compared to $664,904 or $0.29 per share both basic and diluted for the six months ended December 31, 2016.
The increase in net income per share for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was mainly due to high gross profit resulting from higher sales and higher gross profit percentage resulting from product mix and the decrease in expenditures related to engineering design investments made by the company.
In addition, net income per share increased due to the reduction in the Company’s effective tax rate as discussed above.
The increase was offset, in part, by an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources 



The Company's working capital is an appropriate indicator of the liquidity of its business, and during the past two fiscal years, the Company, when possible, has funded all of its operations with cash flows resulting from operating activities and when necessary from its existing cash and investments.
The Company did not borrow any funds during the last two fiscal years.
Management has available a $3,000,000 line of credit to help fund further growth or working capital and letter of credit needs, if necessary, but does not anticipate the need for any borrowed funds in the foreseeable future.
Contingent liabilities on outstanding standby letters of credit agreements aggregated to zero at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

 Index  



The Company's working capital as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $30.4 million and $29.9 million, respectively.
During the three and six-months ended December 31, 2017 the Company repurchased 4,798 shares of its common stock from the Company’s Employee Retirement Plan and Trust (“ESOP”) for a purchase price of $109,694.
During the three and six months ended December 31, 2016 the Company repurchased 1,663 shares of its common stock from the ESOP for a purchase price of $44,335.
Under existing authorizations from the Company's Board of Directors, as of December 31, 2017, management is authorized to purchase an additional $876,297 of Company stock.
The table below presents the summary of cash flow information for the fiscal years indicated: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Net cash provided by operating activities fluctuates between periods primarily as a result of differences in sales and net income, provisions for income taxes, the timing of the collection of accounts receivable, purchase of inventory, and payment of accounts payable.
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of fiscal year 2018 compared to the prior period relates primarily to an increase in accounts receivable, a decrease in inventories, and an increase in net income resulting from higher sales in the current period.
Net cash used in investing activities was less in the first six months of fiscal year 2018 as compared to the prior period due to the purchase of a single significant security in the prior period.
Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of dividend payments on common stock and the company’s purchase and issuance of treasury stock.
The increase in cash used in financing activities is due to the fact that more shares were purchased from the Company’s ESOP in the first six months of fiscal year 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017.
In addition, no proceeds from the exercise of stock options were received during the first six months ended December 31, 2017 when compared with the same period in 2016.
The Company currently believes that the cash flow generated from operations and when necessary, from cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its long-term funding requirements for the foreseeable future.
During the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company expended $185,190 and $223,211, respectively, for plant improvements and new equipment.
The Company has budgeted approximately $2.5 million for new equipment and plant improvements in fiscal year 2018.
As of December 31, 2017, purchase commitments for plant improvements and new equipment totaled $480,000.
Management anticipates that the funds required will be available from current operations.
Management also believes that the Company's reserve for bad debts of $3,000 is adequate given the customers with whom the Company does business.
Historically, bad debt expense has been minimal.
