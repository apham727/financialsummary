There are references to the impact of foreign currency translation in the discussion of the Company’s results of operations.
Dollars of reported results.
Conversely, when the U.S. Dollar weakens and the weaker exchange rates of the current year are used to translate the results of operations of Avnet’s subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies, the resulting impact is an increase in U.S.
Dollars of reported results.
In the discussion that follows, results excluding this impact, primarily for subsidiaries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia/Pacific, are referred to as “constant currency.”  



 In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”), the Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial information, including:  



   ·    Sales adjusted for certain items that impact the year-over-year analysis, which includes the impact of certain acquisitions by adjusting Avnet’s prior periods to include the sales of acquired businesses, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
Operating income excluding such amounts is referred to as “adjusted operating income.” 



 The reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income is presented in the following table:  



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



 Management believes that providing this additional information is useful to readers to better assess and understand operating performance, especially when comparing results with prior periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to GAAP results.
Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes.
However, any analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.

 As an alternative form of financing outside of the United States, the Company sells certain of its trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements.
The Company accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Liquidity  



 The Company held cash and cash equivalents of $482.2 million as of December 29, 2018, of which $433.5 million was held outside the United States.
As of June 30, 2018, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $621.1 million, of which $545.3 million was held outside of the United States.
As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company had a combined total borrowing capacity of $1.75 billion under the Credit Facility and the Securitization Program.
There were no borrowings outstanding and $3.0 million in letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility and $471.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Securitization Program, resulting in approximately $1.28 billion of total availability as of December 29, 2018.
Availability under the Securitization Program is subject to the Company having sufficient eligible trade accounts receivable to support desired borrowings.
The Company currently expects to utilize availability under credit facilities to support working capital and other general corporate purposes to the extent such incremental borrowings do not impact the Company’s investment grade credit rating.
During the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $184.0 million and 91.5 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility and approximately $256.0 million and $161.0 million, respectively, under the Securitization Program.
During the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company had an average daily balance outstanding of approximately $0.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively, under the Credit Facility and approximately $225.0 million and $195.0 million, respectively, under the Securitization Program.
During periods of weakening demand in the electronic components industry, the Company typically generates cash from operating activities.
Conversely, the Company is more likely to use operating cash flows for working capital requirements during periods of higher growth.
The Company generated $299.9 million in cash flows from operating activities over the trailing four fiscal quarters ended December 29, 2018 from continuing operations.
To the extent the cash balances held in foreign locations cannot be remitted back to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner, those cash balances are generally used for ongoing working capital, capital expenditure needs and to support acquisitions, and are currently expected to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S.
The Company is still evaluating the impact of repatriating any additional foreign cash as a result of the Act.
In addition, local government regulations may restrict the Company’s ability to move funds among various locations under certain circumstances.
Management does not believe such restrictions would limit the Company’s ability to pursue its intended business strategy.
Management believes that Avnet’s available borrowing capacity including capacity for the non-recourse sale of accounts receivable and the Company’s expected ability to generate operating cash flows in the future will be sufficient to meet its future liquidity needs.
Additionally, as the Company integrates PF, the Company expects to use cash for restructuring, integration and other expenses.
