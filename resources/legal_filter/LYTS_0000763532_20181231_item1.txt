NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 



(Unaudited) 



NOTE 1 - INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 



The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information, and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the opinion of management, the interim financial statements include all normal adjustments and disclosures necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of  December 31, 2018, the results of its operations for the three and six month periods ended  December 31, 2018 and 2017, and its cash flows for the six month periods ended  December 31, 2018 and 2017.
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 



Consolidation: 



A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Significant changes to our accounting policies as a result of adopting ASU-2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) are discussed below.
Revenue Recognition:  



The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation in its customer contracts or purchase orders.
Control is generally transferred at time of shipment when title and risk of ownership passes to the customer.
For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.
Payment terms are typically within 30 to 90 days from the shipping date, depending on our terms with the customer.
Installation is a separate performance obligation, except for our digital signage products.
For digital signage products, installation is not a separate performance obligation as the product and installation is the combined item promised in digital signage contracts.
The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties.
For these products, the Company has a legal right to payment for performance to date and generally does not accept returns on these items.
The measurement of performance is based upon cost plus a reasonable profit margin for work completed.
Because there is no alternative use and there is a legal right to payment, the Company transfers control of the item as the item is being produced and therefore, recognizes revenue over time.
The customized product types are as follows: 



●   



Customer specific print graphics branding    



●   



Electrical components based on customer specifications    



●   



Digital signage and related media content    



The Company also offers installation services.
Installation revenue is recognized over time as our customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided through the installation process.
Page 7 



Disaggregation of Revenue 



The Company disaggregates the revenue from contracts with customers by the timing of revenue recognition because the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, and timing of our revenue and cash flows.
The table presents a reconciliation of the disaggregation by reportable segments.
Legacy products include lighting fixtures utilizing light sources other than LED technology and printed two and three dimensional graphic products.
Turnkey services and other includes installation services along with shipping and handling charges.
Practical Expedients and Exemptions 



●   



The Company’s contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, as such the Company applies the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred, and have omitted disclosures on the amount of remaining performance obligations.
●   



Shipping costs that are not material in context of the delivery of products are expensed as incurred.
New Accounting Pronouncements: 



On  July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09.
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective adoption method which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
This approach was applied to contracts that were not completed as of  June 30, 2018.
Results for reporting periods beginning  July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period.
The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $591,000 on  July 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, as described below.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



Page 8 



In  February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases.
The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after  December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted.
The Company has an implementation team tasked with reviewing our lease obligations and determining the impact of the new standard to its financial statements.
The implementation team has completed a qualitative assessment of the Company’s active leases and is compiling related data in a central repository.
The Company will continue to evaluate the new standard’s impact to its financial statements.
No items were identified during this evaluation that required adjustment to or disclosure in the accompanying financial statements other than noted below.
On January 16, 2019, the Company appointed Michael C. Beck as the Company’s Senior Vice President - Operations.
Mr. Beck entered into an Employment Offer Letter as of January 11, 2019 which provides that his employment with the Company shall begin on February 11, 2019.
The Employment Offer Letter also defines his compensation and benefit package.
Reclassifications: 



Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation within the cash flows from operating activities section and cash flows from financing activities section of the statement of cash flows.
These reclassifications have no impact on net income or earnings per share.
The Company’s two operating segments are Lighting and Graphics, with one executive team under the new organizational structure reporting directly to the CODM with responsibilities for managing each segment.
Corporate and Eliminations, which captures the Company’s corporate administrative activities, is also reported in the segment information.
The Lighting Segment includes outdoor and indoor lighting utilizing both traditional and LED light sources that have been fabricated and assembled for the Company’s markets, primarily petroleum / convenience stores, automotive dealerships, quick-service restaurants, grocery and pharmacy store, and retail/national accounts.
The Company also addresses lighting product customers through the commercial industrial, stock and flow, and renovation channels.
These products are used in visual image programs in several markets including, but not limited to the petroleum / convenience store market, multi-site retail operations, banking, and restaurants.
The Graphics Segment implements, installs and provides program management services related to products sold by the Graphics Segment and by the Lighting Segment.
The Company’s corporate administration activities are reported in the Corporate and Eliminations line item.
These activities primarily include intercompany profit in inventory eliminations, expense related to certain corporate officers and support staff, the Company’s internal audit staff, expense related to the Company’s Board of Directors, equity compensation expense for various equity awards granted to corporate administration employees, certain consulting expenses, investor relations activities, and a portion of the Company’s legal, auditing and professional fee expenses.
There was no concentration of consolidated net sales in the three and six months ended  December 31, 2018 or 2017.
There was no concentration of accounts receivable at  December 31, 2018 or  June 30, 2018.

Summarized financial information for the Company’s operating segments is provided for the indicated periods and as of  December 31, 2018 and  December 31, 2017: 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



The segment net sales reported above represent sales to external customers.
Segment operating income, which is used in management’s evaluation of segment performance, represents net sales less all operating expenses.
Identifiable assets are those assets used by each segment in its operations.
The Company records a 10% mark-up on intersegment revenues.
Any intersegment profit in inventory is eliminated in consolidation.
As a result, the geographic distribution of the Company’s net sales and long-lived assets originate within North America.
(b)   Calculated using the “Treasury Stock” method as if dilutive securities were exercised and the funds were used to purchase common shares at the average market price during the period.
(c)   Options to purchase 3,536,732 common shares and 3,569,762 common shares for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in the computation of the three month diluted loss per share because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares.
Additionally, options to purchase 3,356,101 common shares and 3,549,705 common shares for the six months ended at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in the computation of the six month diluted loss per share because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares.
For the three months ended and the six months ended in December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the effect of dilutive securities was not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share because there was a net loss for the period.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



NOTE 7 - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 



The carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment.
The Company may first assess qualitative factors in order to determine if goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired.
If through the qualitative assessment it is determined that it is more likely than not that goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not impaired, no further testing is required.
If it is determined more likely than not that goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are impaired, or if the Company elects not to first assess qualitative factors, the Company’s impairment testing continues with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of a market approach and an income (discounted cash flow) approach, at the reporting unit level.
Company management uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment tests.
The Company identified its reporting units in conjunction with its annual goodwill impairment testing.
The Company has a total of three reporting units that contain goodwill.
There are two reporting units within the Lighting Segment and one reporting unit within the Graphics Segment.
A sustained and significant decline in the Company’s stock price in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 led management to believe that a triggering event occurred and that an interim goodwill impairment test was required for one of the reporting units in the Lighting Segment that contains goodwill, as of  December 31, 2018.
In accordance with ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” which was adopted in a prior period, the requirement to perform step 2 in the impairment test was not required.
The result of the impairment test on the reporting unit in the Lighting Segment indicated that goodwill was impaired by $20,165,000.
The following table presents information about the Company's goodwill on the dates or for the periods indicated:

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



Amortization expense for intangible assets was $689,000 and $690,000 for the three months ended  December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $1,380 and $1,380 for the six months ended  December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Future amortization expense (in thousands) associated with these intangible assets is expected to be $2,761 in 2019, $2,687 in 2020, $2,682 in 2021, $2,460 in 2022, $2,412 in 2023, and $18,985 after 2023.
NOTE 8 - REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT 



In  February 2017, the Company amended its secured line of credit to a $100 million facility.
The line of credit expires in the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
Interest on the revolving line of credit is charged based upon an increment over the LIBOR rate as periodically determined, or at the bank’s base lending rate, at the Company’s option.
The increment over the LIBOR borrowing rate, as periodically determined, fluctuates between 125 and 250 basis points depending upon the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), as defined in the line of credit agreement.
The increment over LIBOR borrowing rate will be 200 basis points for the third quarter.
The fee on the unused balance of the $100 million committed line of credit is 20 basis points.
Under the terms of this line of credit, the Company has agreed to a negative pledge of real estate assets and is required to comply with financial covenants that limit the ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA and require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.
As of  December 31, 2018, there was $48.4 million borrowed against the line of credit, and $51.6 million was available as of that date.
Based on the terms of the line of credit and the maturity date, the debt has been classified as long term.

Page 14 



NOTE 13 – RESTRUCTURING COSTS 



On October 29, 2018, the Company announced plans to close its lighting facility in New Windsor, New York.
The closure is part of ongoing actions to align the Company’s supply chain to more cost effectively serve the changing requirements of the lighting market.
The Company will move production to its other existing facilities.
The Company will record an estimated range of restructuring costs of $0.8 million to $1.5 million mostly over the next two quarters and up until the time the facility is ultimately sold.
The transfer of production is expected to be completed by June 30, 2019.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company has incurred restructuring costs of $401,000 related to the closure of the New Windsor facility.
The Company also incurred $919,000 of expense to write-down inventory which is not included in the tables below.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, management approved the closure of its 12,000 square foot leased facility in Hawthorne, California.
The facility was used as a warehouse and for light assembly of light fixtures.
The Company has moved the light assembly to its Blue Ash, Ohio facility.
The restructuring charges consist primarily of transportation costs to move inventory to Blue Ash, the impairment of equipment, costs to restore the leased facility, and severance benefits.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company has incurred restructuring costs of $155,000 related to the closure of the Hawthorne facility.
The Company also incurred $148,000 of expense to write-down inventory which is a re-valuation of the previous estimate and which is not included in the tables below.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  



The above table does not include fixed asset impairment and accelerated depreciation expense of $228,000 recorded in the first six months of fiscal 2019.
Refer to Note 12 for information regarding additional severance expenses that are not included in the restructuring costs identified in this footnote.
This continual estimation process often results in a change to the expected effective income tax rate for the year.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, a deferred tax asset of $4.8 million was created as a result of the impairment of goodwill in the Lighting reporting unit.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, a deferred tax asset of $10.7 million was created as a result of the impairment of goodwill in the Lighting reporting unit.
