Overview
The fiscal year ending November 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018) is a 53-week year and the fiscal year ended October 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017) was a 52-week year.

The sales increase in the United States in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of the Acquisition and an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial end market, partially offset by a decrease in demand for our products sold into the Consumer end market. Additionally, the sales increase in the United States in the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was a result of an additional week of operations in the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017.

Japan included $69.2 million and $141.3 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, respectively, as compared to no revenue, as a result of the deferral of revenue related to sales to distributors, in the three- and six-month periods ended April 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition. The sales increase in Japan in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of the Acquisition and an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial end market. Additionally, the sales increase in Japan in the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was a result of an additional week of operations in the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017.
China included $84.5 million and $173.4 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, respectively, as compared to $44.6 million of revenue in the three- and six-month periods ended April 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.

Gross Margin
Gross margin percentage increased by 1,250 basis points and 780 basis points in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, primarily because the three- and six-month periods ended April 29, 2017 included cost of sales adjustments of $121.1 million related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value. Additionally, the increases in gross margin percentages in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, were a result of a mix shift in favor of higher margin products being sold resulting from the Acquisition, and lower cost of sales resulting from favorable factory variances related to increased utilization at our manufacturing facilities. 
Amortization expenses increased in the three- and six-month periods ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, as a result of the purchase of intangible assets as part of the Acquisition.
We monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, as well as a better alignment of expenses with revenues. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years, which resulted in special charges of $16.1 million and $8.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively, in an effort to reduce overall operating costs. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded a special charge of $41.3 million related to an early retirement offer action, which we expect to result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation, and employee benefit savings of approximately $28.4 million once fully implemented.
See Note 6, Special Charges, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.
Operating Income
Nonoperating Expense (Income)
The year-over-year increase in nonoperating expense in the six-month period ended May 5, 2018 was primarily the result of a decrease in interest income as a result of lower invested cash balances in the first six month of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017 and an increase in interest expense related to a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion entered into in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, $2.1 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 in connection with the Acquisition and $750 million of senior unsecured notes issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by a reduction in fees related to financing commitments which were entered into prior to the Acquisition and which terminated upon the Acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. 
Net Income
Net income increased in the three-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of a $318.1 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $3.3 million increase in nonoperating expense and a $28.6 million increase in provision for income taxes.
Net income increased in the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of a $457.2 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $36.8 million increase in nonoperating expense and a $83.1 million increase in provision for income taxes.
At May 5, 2018, our principal source of liquidity was $806.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $388.9 million was held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. We continue to assert our intent to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, however we are in the process of analyzing the impact that the Tax Legislation has on this indefinite reinvestment assertion. As we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely at this time, certain cash held outside the United States is not available for repatriation as dividends to the United States. If such funds are needed for U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding and U.S. state income taxes to the extent not already subject to taxation. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk. 
On the Acquisition Date, we borrowed under a term loan agreement consisting of a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2022. As of May 5, 2018, we have paid $1.4 billion of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan and paid $1.2 billion of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan. 
At May 5, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $806.5 million. The following changes contributed to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the six-month period ended May 5, 2018 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2017.
Operating Activities
The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of changes in working capital, partially offset by lower net income adjusted for non-cash items, primarily resulting from changes to income taxes related to the Tax Legislation.
Investing Activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, as well as cash used for acquisitions.
The decrease in cash used for investing activities during the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily the result of a decrease in payments for acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities.
Financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans.
The change in cash related to financing activities during the six-month period ended May 5, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds of $10.4 billion received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and financing commitments, and repayments of $870.0 million on the 3-year unsecured term loan and $750.0 million on the 5-year unsecured term loan. 
The increase in accounts receivable in dollars was primarily the result of higher product shipments in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. 
Current liabilities decreased to $1.4 billion at May 5, 2018 from $1.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the current portion of our debt.

$5.0 Billion Aggregate Principal Term Loans
On the Acquisition Date, we drew down on a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2022. The term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.75% and 1.63% in the case of the 3-year unsecured term loan, and a margin of between 0.88% and 1.75% in the case of the 5-year unsecured term loan. As of May 5, 2018, we have paid $1.4 billion of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan and paid $1.2 billion of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan. 
We have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on July 10, 2020. The agreement for such revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) provides that we may borrow up to $1.0 billion. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0. The debt covenant will be reduced over time to 3.0 to 1.0 starting in May 2018. As of May 5, 2018, we were compliant with these covenants. 
Stock Repurchase Program
Capital Expenditures
Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $117.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 to be in the range of $230.0 million to $270.0 million. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
Dividends
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 445,000 sq. ft. for a facility in Santa Clara, California. The lease term is through October 2030 and we expect to occupy the building beginning November 1, 2018.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, in an underwritten public offering, we issued the 2020 Notes and the January 2021 Notes.
There have not been any other material changes during the six-month period ended May 5, 2018 to the amounts presented in the table summarizing our contractual obligations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2017.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard, including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations. As amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019. We have developed a project plan for
