The fiscal year ending November 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018) is a 53-week year and the fiscal year ended October 28, 2017 (fiscal 2017) was a 52-week year. The additional week in fiscal 2018 was included in the first quarter ended February 3, 2018. Therefore, the first nine months of fiscal 2018 included an additional week of operations as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
On March 10, 2017 (Acquisition Date), we completed the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation (Linear), a designer, manufacturer and marketer of high performance analog integrated circuits. The total consideration paid to acquire Linear was approximately $15.8 billion. The acquisition of Linear is referred to as the Acquisition. The condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include the financial results of Linear prospectively from the Acquisition Date. See Note 13, Acquisitions, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.

The sales decrease in the United States in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of a decrease in demand for our products sold into the Consumer end market, partially offset by an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial end market. The United States and Rest of North and South America included $304.1 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to $109.6 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended July 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.

The sales increase in Europe in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial and Communications end markets. Europe included $271.1 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to $129.3 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended July 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.

The sales increase in Japan in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial end market. Japan included $205.3 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to $55.8 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended July 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition. The sales increase in Japan in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of the Acquisition, an increase in demand for our products sold into the Industrial end market and an additional week of operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2017.
The sales increase in China and the Rest of Asia in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of a broad-based increase in demand for our products sold into all end markets. China included $272.5 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to $126.6 million of revenue in the nine-month period ended July 29, 2017, as a result of the Acquisition.

Gross margin percentage increased by 1,460 basis points and 1,060 basis points in the three- and nine-month periods ended August 4, 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, primarily because the three- and nine-month periods ended July 29, 2017 included cost of sales adjustments of $195.6 million and $316.7 million, respectively, related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value. Additionally, the increases in gross margin percentages in the three- and nine-month periods ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same periods of the prior fiscal year, were a result of lower cost of sales resulting from increased efficiencies at our manufacturing facilities. The increase in gross margin percentage in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018 was partially offset by increases in amortization expense of developed technology intangible assets and depreciation expense related to the write-up of fixed assets acquired to fair value as a result of the Acquisition.
Amortization expenses decreased in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of changes to the amortization period of certain acquired intangible assets resulting from the Acquisition during the measurement period.
Amortization expenses increased in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as a result of the purchase of intangible assets as part of the Acquisition, and to a lesser extent, other immaterial acquisitions in fiscal 2018.
We monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, as well as a better alignment of expenses with revenues. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years, which resulted in special charges of $16.1 million and $8.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively, in an effort to reduce overall operating costs. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded a special charge of $41.3 million related to an early retirement offer action, which we expect to result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation, and employee benefit savings of approximately $28.4 million once fully implemented.
See Note 6, Special Charges, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.
The year-over-year decrease in nonoperating expense in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018 was primarily the result of a decrease in interest expense related to financing commitments which were entered into prior to and upon the Acquisition and which have subsequently been repaid in part or in full, partially offset by rising interest rates.
Additionally, we recorded discrete benefits for excess tax benefits from share-based payments of $6.0 and $24.2 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended August 4, 2018, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended August 4, 2018 also included a tax benefit of $4.2 million and $7.9 million, respectively, resulting from the release of uncertain tax positions due to a statute of limitation expiration during the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended July 29, 2017 included a tax benefit of $15.0 million for the release of a state tax credit valuation allowance as a result of the Acquisition.
Net income increased in the three-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as a result of a $304.2 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $9.6 million decrease in nonoperating expense and a $31.8 million decrease in provision for income taxes.
Net income increased in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, as a result of a $761.4 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $27.3 million increase in nonoperating expense and a $51.3 million increase in provision for income taxes.
At August 4, 2018, our principal source of liquidity was $772.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $369.7 million was held in the United States. The balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. We continue to assert our intent to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, however we are in the process of analyzing the impact that the Tax Legislation has on this indefinite reinvestment assertion. As we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely at this time, certain cash held outside the United States is not available for repatriation as dividends to the United States. If such funds are needed for U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding and U.S. state income taxes to the extent not already subject to taxation. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. We maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk. 
On the Acquisition Date, we borrowed under a term loan agreement consisting of a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due March 10, 2022. As of August 4, 2018, we have paid $1.9 billion of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan and paid $1.2 billion of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan. 
At August 4, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $772.6 million. The following changes contributed to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2017.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily a result of higher net income income adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in working capital, primarily resulting from changes to income taxes related to the Tax Legislation.
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, as well as cash used for acquisitions.
The decrease in cash used for investing activities during the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily the result of a decrease in payments for acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities.
Financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans.
The increase in accounts receivable in dollars was primarily the result of higher product shipments in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. 
Current liabilities decreased to $1.3 billion at August 4, 2018 from $1.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the current portion of our debt. 
On June 3, 2013, we issued the 2023 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2013.

$400.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2021 Notes), $550.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.125% Senior Unsecured Notes (December 2023 Notes), $900.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 3.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2026 Notes) and $250.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 4.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (2036 Notes)
$300.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.85% Senior Unsecured Notes (2020 Notes) and $450.0 Million Aggregate Principal Amount of 2.95% Senior Unsecured Notes (January 2021 Notes)
On March 12, 2018, we issued the 2020 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on March 12 and September 12 of each year, commencing September 12, 2018, and the January 2021 Notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on January 12 and July 12 of each year, commencing July 12, 2018.
$5.0 Billion Aggregate Principal Term Loans
We have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on July 10, 2020. The agreement for such revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) provides that we may borrow up to $1.0 billion. To date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0. The debt covenant will be reduced over time to 3.0 to 1.0 which began in May 2018. As of August 4, 2018, we were in compliance with these covenants. 
Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of August 4, 2018, we had repurchased a total of approximately 147.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $5.4 billion under this program. As of August 4, 2018, an additional $792.5 million remains available for repurchase under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. In connection with the Acquisition, we had temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. On August 21, 2018, the Board of Directors approved an increase to the current authorization for the stock repurchase program by an additional $2.0 billion to $8.2 billion in the aggregate. We also, from time to time, repurchase shares in settlement of employee minimum tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units.
Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $168.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 to be in the range of $230.0 million to $270.0 million. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 445,000 sq. ft. for a facility in Santa Clara, California. The lease term is through October 2030 and we expect to occupy the building beginning January 1, 2019.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, in an underwritten public offering, we issued the 2020 Notes and the January 2021 Notes.
There have not been any other material changes during the nine-month period ended August 4, 2018 to the amounts presented in the table summarizing our contractual obligations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2017.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard, including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations. As amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019. We have developed a project plan for the implementation of the guidance, including a review of all revenue streams to identify any differences in the timing, measurement or presentation of revenue recognition. We have reviewed our revenue streams, including those from the Acquisition, and are nearing completion in assessing all potential impacts of the standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, including any impacts from recently issued amendments, and retrospectively adjusting financial information for prior fiscal years. While we are still in the process of completing our evaluation of the standard, we currently believe the most significant impact will be related to the timing of recognition of sales to certain distributors. As described in Note 2, Revenue Recognition, of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we currently defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. Upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer, but rather, will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. We will adopt ASU 2014-09, using the full retrospective method, upon its effective date for us which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
ITEM 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On March 10, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation, an independent manufacturer of high performance analog integrated circuits, which we refer to as the Acquisition. In connection with the Acquisition, we had temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. On August 21, 2018, we have reinstated our share repurchase program. The table below summarizes the activity related to stock repurchases for the three months ended August 4, 2018.
