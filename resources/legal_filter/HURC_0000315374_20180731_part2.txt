PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 



Item 1.
Pursuant to applicable accounting rules, we accrue the minimum liability for each known claim when the estimated outcome is a range of possible loss and no one amount within that range is more likely than another.
We maintain insurance policies for such matters, and we record insurance recoveries when we determine such recovery to be probable.
We believe that the ultimate resolution of claims for any losses will not exceed our insurance policy coverages.
