Net Sales 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Net sales increased 8% for the 13-week period ended June 30, 2018 when compared to the year-ago quarter.
The outdoor, aviation, marine, and fitness segments collectively increased by 17%, contributing 80% of total revenue.
Fitness was the largest portion of our revenue mix at 25% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to 22% in the second quarter of 2017.
Auto revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in the second quarter of 2017 at 27% and declined to 20% in the second quarter of 2018.
Total unit sales in the second quarter of 2018 decreased to 3,783 when compared to total unit sales of 3,904 in the second quarter of 2017.
Auto segment revenue decreased 19% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction.
Outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation segment revenues increased 4%, 24%, 24%, and 23%, respectively, when compared to the year-ago quarter.
The fitness segment revenues increase was primarily driven by strong sales in advanced wearables and cycling products.
Outdoor and aviation segment revenue increases were driven by increased sales across most product lines within each segment.
Cost of Goods Sold 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Cost of goods sold increased 7% in absolute dollars compared to the prior year quarter.
The fitness and aviation segments increase in cost of goods was largely consistent with the increase in sales.

Gross profit dollars in the second quarter of 2018 increased 8% while gross margin increased 30 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter.
Gross margin in the marine segment increased compared to the year-ago quarter, as discussed above.
Gross margin remained relatively flat across the aviation and fitness segments.
Advertising Expense 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Advertising expense increased 4% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.
The total absolute dollar increase was driven primarily by increased cooperative advertising associated with higher sales.
Auto advertising expense, in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue, increased compared to the year-ago quarter primarily due to a refresh of point-of-sale displays.
Advertising expense, as a percent of revenues, decreased in the fitness segment due to greater leverage on fitness advertising spend.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Selling, general and administrative expense increased 14% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.
The auto segment increase as a percent of revenues in the second quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to accelerated amortization of an intangible asset related to a previous acquisition.
The increase in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenues in the marine segment was primarily attributable to expenses associated with recent acquisitions.
25  



Research and Development Expense 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Research and development expense increased $14.5 million in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues compared to the year-ago quarter.

Operating Income 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Operating income increased 4% in absolute dollars and decreased 90 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the year-ago quarter.
The growth in operating income in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to revenue growth while the slight decrease in operating income as a percent of revenues is primarily attributable to the increased operating expenses, as discussed above.
Other Income (Expense) 



  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The average return on cash and investments, including interest and capital gains/losses, during the second quarter of 2018 was 1.9% compared to 1.6% during the same quarter of 2017.
Interest income increased primarily due to slightly higher yields on fixed-income securities.
Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar.
The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds.
The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.
Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
26  



The $2.6 million currency gain recognized in the second quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling within the 13-weeks ended June 30, 2018.
During this period, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 4.7% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of $26.7 million, while the U.S. Dollar strengthened 5.2% against the Euro and 5.8% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $14.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
The remaining net currency loss of $8.2 million was related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
The $15.1 million currency gain recognized in the second quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling and slight strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar within the 13-weeks ended July 1, 2017.
During this period, the U.S. Dollar weakened 7.3% against the Euro and 3.8% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $11.5 million and $2.7 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar strengthened 0.3% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of $1.3 million.
The remaining net currency loss of $0.4 million was related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
The effective tax rate was 19.4% in the second quarter of 2018, compared to 24.5% in the second quarter of 2017.
Excluding the effect of the $7.3 million tax expense associated with the expiration of share-based awards in second quarter of 2017, the second quarter of 2018 effective tax rate decreased 200 basis points compared to the effective tax rate in the prior year quarter primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate.

During this period, the U.S. Dollar weakened 6.8% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $41.6 million, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 8.7% against the Euro and 5.6% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $14.2 million and $3.5 million, respectively.

We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our long-term projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements.

It is management’s goal to invest the on-hand cash in accordance with the investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors of each applicable Garmin entity holding the cash.
