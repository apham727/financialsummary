References to the second quarters of 2018 and 2017 represent the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
In the second quarter of 2018, sales, net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $174.8 million, $10.0 million and $0.38 per share, respectively, compared to $161.2 million, $11.2 million and $0.43 per share, respectively, in the second quarter of 2017. In the first six months of 2018, sales, net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $348.3 million, $44.7 million and $1.72, respectively, compared to $307.5 million, $21.9 million and $0.84 per share, respectively, in the first six months of 2017. 
Net sales increased $13.6 million, or 8.4%, to $174.8 million in the second quarter of 2018 from $161.2 million in the second quarter of 2017. Net sales increased $40.8 million, or 13.2%, to $348.3 million in the first six months of 2018 from $307.5 million in the first six months of 2017. The increase in net sales in the second quarter of 2018 as compared to the second quarter of 2017 was due to a $14.0 million increase in the USG segment, a $2.4 million increase in the Test segment and a $0.3 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment, partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in the Filtration segment. The increase in net sales in the first six months of 2018 as compared to the corresponding prior year period was due to a $34.3 million increase in the USG segment, a $6.2 million increase in the Test segment and a $2.2 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment, partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in the Filtration segment. 
In the second quarter of 2018, net sales of $40.8 million were $2.4 million, or 6.3%, higher than the $38.4 million recorded in the second quarter of 2017. Net sales increased $6.1 million, or 8.4%, to $78.3 million in the first six months of 2018 from $72.2 million in the first six months of 2017. The increase in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was primarily due to higher sales from the segment’s U.S. operations due to the timing of test and measurement chamber projects. 
Net sales increased $14.0 million, or 42.8%, to $46.7 million in the second quarter of 2018 from $32.7 million in the second quarter of 2017. Net sales increased $34.3 million, or 50.3%, to $102.5 million in the first six months of 2018 from $68.2 million in the first six months of 2017. The increase in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 was mainly due to the sales contributions from the NRG, Morgan Schaffer and Vanguard Instruments (Vanguard) acquisitions. The increase in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 was mainly due to the sales contributions from NRG, Morgan Schaffer and Vanguard and new products and software solutions at Doble.

In the second quarter of 2018, net sales of $21.5 million were $0.3 million, or 1.4%, higher than the $21.2 million in the second quarter of 2017. Net sales increased $2.3 million, or 5.8%, to $41.7 million in the first six months of 2018 from $39.4 million in the first six months of 2017. The increase in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was primarily due to the increase in net sales from Plastique due to increased shipments to new customers as well as fluctuations in currency. 
The Company received new orders totaling $387.8 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to $349.8 million in the first six months of 2017. Of the new orders received in the first six months of 2018, $133.2 million related to Filtration products, $106.4 million related to Test products, $110.1 million related to USG products, and $38.1 million related to Technical Packaging products.

Amortization of intangible assets was $4.6 million and $9.0 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to $3.8 million and $7.5 million for the corresponding periods of 2017. Amortization expenses consist of amortization of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily software). The increase in amortization expense in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was mainly due to an increase in amortization of intangibles related to the Morgan Schaffer, NRG and Mayday acquisitions. 
Other expenses, net, was $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to other income, net, of $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2017. The principal components in other expenses, net, in the second quarter of 2018 were $2.1 million of charges primarily related to the USG segment restructuring activities, including the Doble facility consolidations, partially offset by gains on derivative instruments. The restructuring charges mainly related to severance and compensation benefits, professional fees and asset impairment charges related to abandoned assets. There were no individually significant items in other (income) expenses, net, in the second quarter of 2017. 
Other expenses, net, was $1.6 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to other income, net, of $1.3 million in the first six months of 2017.

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on EBIT, and provides EBIT on a consolidated basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, above. EBIT was $15.6 million (8.9% of net sales) for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $17.7 million (11.0% of net sales) for the second quarter of 2017. For the first six months of 2018, EBIT was $30.6 million (8.8% of net sales) compared to $34.5 million (11.2% of net sales) for the first six months of 2017. 
The following table presents a reconciliation of EBIT to net earnings. 
EBIT in the second quarter of 2018 was $5.3 million (13.0% of net sales) compared to $3.8 million (9.8% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2017. EBIT in the first six months of 2018 was $7.9 million (10.1% of net sales) compared to $6.2 million (8.6% of net sales) in the first six months of 2017. The increase in EBIT in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year periods was primarily due to the increased sales volumes mainly from the segment’s U.S. operations. 
-Utility Solutions Group 
EBIT in the second quarter of 2018 was $5.6 million (12.0% of net sales) compared to $7.4 million (22.8% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2017. EBIT in the first six months of 2018 was $16.3 million (15.9% of net sales) compared to EBIT of $17.1 million (25.1% of net sales) in the first six months of 2017. The decrease in EBIT in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was mainly due to the restructuring charges incurred in the second quarter of 2018 and product mix. During the second quarter of 2018, the Company incurred $1.9 million of charges related to closing the Doble facilities in Norway and China consisting mainly of employee severance and compensation benefits, professional fees, and asset impairment charges. 
-Technical Packaging 
EBIT in the second quarter of 2018 was $1.9 million (8.8% of net sales) compared to $2.2 million (10.3% of net sales) in the second quarter of 2017. EBIT in the first six months of 2018 was $2.9 million (6.8% of net sales) compared to $3.2 million (8.2% of net sales) in the first six months of 2017. The decrease in EBIT in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was mainly due to product mix at Plastique including lower margin projects. 
-Corporate 
Corporate costs included in EBIT were $8.3 million and $17.2 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to $7.3 million and $14.4 million in the corresponding periods of 2017. The increase in Corporate costs in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was primarily due to higher professional fees and an increase in amortization of intangible assets related to recent acquisitions. 
Interest expense was $2.0 million and $4.2 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, and $0.9 million and $1.5 million in the corresponding periods of 2017. The increase in interest expense in the first six months of 2018 compared to the corresponding period of 2017 was mainly due to higher average outstanding borrowings ($264 million compared to $167 million) and higher average interest rates (2.9% vs. 1.8%) as a result of the additional borrowings to fund the Company’s recent acquisitions. 
The Company’s overall financial position and liquidity remains strong. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) increased to $205.9 million at March 31, 2018 from $197.8 million at September 30, 2017. Inventories increased by $12.5 million during this period mainly due to a $6.2 million increase within the Filtration segment primarily to support new aerospace platforms and a $4.1 million increase within the USG segment. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on long-term contracts decreased $7.0 million in the first six months of 2018 due to ETS-Lindgren ($4.7 million) and VACCO ($2.3 million). 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $33.0 million and $36.7 million in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of 2018 as compared to the first six months of 2017 was due to higher working capital requirements. 
Capital expenditures were $10.1 million and $15.4 million in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in the first six months of 2018 was mainly due to a decrease in machinery and equipment at Plastique ($3.0 million) and VACCO ($1.6 million). In addition, the Company incurred expenditures for capitalized software of $4.6 million and $3.4 million in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which updates ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits. This update permits only the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement expense to be reported with other compensation costs, while all other components are required to be reported separately in other deductions, outside any subtotal of operating income. These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted on a retrospective basis. The updates change presentation only and will not impact the Company’s results of operations. 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. This guidance has been further clarified and amended. The new standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has selected the Cumulative Effect method of transition to the new standard.
