Net sales increased $61.8 million, or 12.9%, to $540.5 million in the first nine months of 2018 from $478.7 million in the first nine months of 2017. The increase in net sales in the third quarter of 2018 as compared to the third quarter of 2017 was due to a $13.4 million increase in the USG segment, a $7.5 million increase in the Test segment and a $1.6 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in the Filtration segment. The increase in net sales in the first nine months of 2018 as compared to the corresponding prior year period was due to a $47.7 million increase in the USG segment, a $13.6 million increase in the Test segment and a $3.8 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment, partially offset by a $3.3 million decrease in the Filtration segment. 
In the third quarter of 2018, net sales of $45.0 million were $7.5 million, or 19.9%, higher than the $37.5 million recorded in the third quarter of 2017.

The increase in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was primarily due to higher sales from the segment’s U.S. operations due to the timing of test and measurement chamber projects. 
Net sales increased $13.4 million, or 31.9%, to $55.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 from $42.1 million in the third quarter of 2017. Net sales increased $47.7 million, or 43.2%, to $157.9 million in the first nine months of 2018 from $110.3 million in the first nine months of 2017. The increase in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 was mainly due to the sales contributions from the NRG, Morgan Schaffer and Vanguard Instruments acquisitions. The increase in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 was mainly due to the sales contributions from NRG, Morgan Schaffer and Vanguard Instruments and new products and software solutions at Doble.

The increase in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was primarily due to the increase in net sales from Plastique driven by fluctuations in currency ($2.5 million for the first nine months of 2018) and increased shipments to new customers.

Amortization of intangible assets was $4.6 million and $13.6 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively, compared to $4.1 million and $11.5 million for the corresponding periods of 2017. Amortization expenses consist of amortization of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily software).

For the first nine months of 2018, EBIT was $56.2 million (10.4% of net sales) compared to $53.1 million (11.1% of net sales) for the first nine months of 2017.

EBIT in the first nine months of 2018 was $13.8 million (11.2% of net sales) compared to $11.1 million (10.1% of net sales) in the first nine months of 2017. The increase in EBIT in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year periods was primarily due to the increased sales volumes mainly from the segment’s U.S. operations. 
-Utility Solutions Group 
EBIT in the third quarter of 2018 was $11.5 million (20.8% of net sales) compared to $8.5 million (20.2% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2017. EBIT in the first nine months of 2018 was $27.8 million (17.6% of net sales) compared to EBIT of $25.6 million (23.2% of net sales) in the first nine months of 2017. The increase in EBIT in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was mainly due to the higher sales volumes as well as the EBIT contribution from the recent acquisitions of NRG, Morgan Schaffer and Vanguard Instruments. In addition, EBIT in the first nine months of 2018 was negatively impacted by $1.9 million of charges recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to closing the Doble facilities in Norway and China consisting mainly of employee severance and compensation benefits, professional fees, and asset impairment charges. 
-Technical Packaging 
EBIT in the third quarter of 2018 was $2.5 million (11.4% of net sales) compared to $2.4 million (11.9% of net sales) in the third quarter of 2017. EBIT in the first nine months of 2018 was $5.4 million (8.4% of net sales) compared to $5.7 million (9.5% of net sales) in the first nine months of 2017. The decrease in EBIT as a percent of net sales in the third quarter of 2018 and the decrease in EBIT in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was mainly due to product mix at Plastique including lower margin projects. 
-Corporate 
Corporate costs included in EBIT were $8.7 million and $25.8 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively, compared to $9.1 million and $23.5 million in the corresponding periods of 2017. The decrease in Corporate costs in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 was mainly due to the $0.5 million of gains on derivative instruments recorded in the third quarter of 2018. The increase in Corporate costs in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 was primarily due to higher professional fees and an increase in amortization of intangible assets related to recent acquisitions. 
Interest expense was $2.2 million and $6.5 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively, and $1.2 million and $2.8 million in the corresponding periods of 2017. The increase in interest expense in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the corresponding period of 2017 was mainly due to higher average outstanding borrowings ($263 million compared to $189 million) and higher average interest rates (2.97% vs. 1.90%) as a result of the additional borrowings to fund the Company’s recent acquisitions.

Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) increased to $210.0 million at June 30, 2018 from $197.8 million at September 30, 2017. Inventories increased by $21.1 million during this period mainly due to a $10.7 million increase within the Filtration segment primarily to support new aerospace platforms, a $4.3 million increase within the Test segment and a $4.2 million increase within the USG segment to support revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2018. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on long-term contracts decreased $8.1 million in the first nine months of 2018 mainly due to ETS-Lindgren ($7.3 million) related to timing of projects. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $53.9 million and $33.5 million in the first nine months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2018 as compared to the first nine months of 2017 was driven by higher earnings and lower working capital requirements. 
Capital expenditures were $15.5 million and $23.1 million in the first nine months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in the first nine months of 2018 was mainly due to a decrease in machinery and equipment at Plastique ($3.6 million) and VACCO ($1.8 million).

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which updates ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits.

These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted on a retrospective basis. The updates change presentation only and will not impact the Company’s results of operations. 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-062, Leases (Topic 842), which, among other things, requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. This standard will increase an entities’ reported assets and liabilities.
