In the second quarter of 2019, sales, net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $193.9 million, $18.8 million and $0.72 per share, respectively, compared to $174.8 million, $10.0 million and $0.38 per share, respectively, in the second quarter of 2018.

In the second quarter of 2019, net sales of $193.9 million were $19.1 million, or 10.9%, higher than the $174.8 million in the second quarter of 2018. In the first six months of 2019, net sales of $376.5 million were $28.2 million, or 8.1%, higher than the $348.3 million in the first six months of 2018. The increase in net sales in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the second quarter of 2018 was due to a $13.7 million increase in the Filtration segment, a $2.2 million increase in the USG segment, a $2.1 million increase in the Test segment and a $1.2 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment. The increase in net sales in the first six months of 2019 as compared to the first six months of 2018 was due to a $19.9 million increase in the Filtration segment, a $2.3 million increase in the USG segment, a $5.8 million increase in the Test segment and a $0.3 million increase in the Technical Packaging segment. 
In the second quarter of 2019, net sales of $42.9 million were $2.1 million, or 5.1%, higher than the $40.8 million in the second quarter of 2018. In the first six months of 2019, net sales of $84.2 million were $5.9 million, or 7.5%, higher than the $78.3 million in the first six months of 2018. The increase in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 was primarily due to higher sales from the segment’s U.S. operations due to the timing of test and measurement chamber projects. 
In the second quarter of 2019, net sales of $48.9 million were $2.2 million, or 4.7%, higher than the $46.7 million in the second quarter of 2018. In the first six months of 2019, net sales of $104.7 million were $2.3 million, or 2.2%, higher than the $102.5 million in the first six months of 2018. The increase in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 was mainly due to the sales contributions from the Vanguard Instruments and Manta product lines and new products and software solutions at Doble.

The increase in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 was primarily due to the increase in net sales from TEQ due to increased shipments to new customers.

Amortization of intangible assets was $4.6 million and $9.3 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively, compared to $4.6 million and $9.0 million for the corresponding periods of 2018. Amortization expenses consist of amortization of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily software). The increase in amortization expense in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018 was mainly due to an increase in amortization of intangibles related to the Manta acquisition. 
Other income, net, was $4.7 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to other expenses, net, of $1.6 million in the first six months of 2018. The principal component in other income, net, in the first six months of 2019 was a gain of approximately $8 million on the sale of the Doble Watertown, MA building and land, partially offset by certain restructuring activities at Doble, PTI, VACCO and Plastique and losses on derivative instruments. The principal components in other expenses, net, in the first six months of 2018 were $2.1 million of charges related to the USG segment restructuring activities as mentioned above, partially offset by gains on derivative instruments.

The increase in EBIT in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 was mainly due to the gain on sale of the Doble Watertown facility of approximately $8 million in the first quarter of 2019, as well as an increase in EBIT from Morgan Schaffer and Manta product lines partially offset by a decrease in EBIT from NRG due to market softness. 
-Technical Packaging

The decrease in EBIT in the second quarter and first six months of 2019 compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 was mainly due to the restructuring charges incurred related to the Plastique facility consolidation, ($0.4 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $0.7 million in the first six months of 2019). These charges consisted primarily of severance and compensation benefits and asset impairment charges. 
-Corporate

The income tax expense for the first six months of 2019 was $8.5 million compared to income tax benefit of $18.3 million for the first six months of 2018.

Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) increased to $234.0 million at March 31, 2019 from $195.5 million at September 30, 2018. Inventories decreased by $10.9 million during this period mainly due to a $12.9 million decrease within the Filtration segment resulting primarily from the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). Contract assets increased $47.5 million in the first six months of 2019 mainly due to the adoption of ASC 606 within the Filtration segment.

The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of 2019 as compared to the first six months of 2018 was due to higher working capital requirements.
