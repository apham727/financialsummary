References to the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 represent the three-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
In the first quarter of 2019, sales, net earnings and diluted earnings per share were $182.6 million, $17.3 million and $0.66 per share, respectively, compared to $173.5 million, $34.7 million and $1.33 per share, respectively, in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in net earnings and diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to the $25.1 million net tax benefit the Company recorded in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017. 
Net sales increased $9.1 million, or 5.2%, to $182.6 million in the first quarter of 2019 from $173.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in net sales in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was due to a $6.2 million increase in the Filtration segment, a $3.8 million increase in the Test segment and a $0.1 million increase in the USG segment, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in the Technical Packaging segment. 
In the first quarter of 2019, net sales of $55.9 million were $0.1 million, or 0.2% higher than the $55.8 million in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to net sales increases from Morgan Schaffer and the Vanguard Instruments product line and new products and software solutions at Doble partially offset by a decrease in net sales at NRG due to softness in the renewable energy market. 
-Technical Packaging 
Amortization of intangible assets was $4.7 million and $4.4 million for the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization expenses consist of amortization of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily software). The increase in amortization expense in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to an increase in amortization of intangibles related to the Manta acquisition. 
Other income, net, was $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to other expenses, net, of $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. The principal component in other income, net, in the first quarter of 2019 was a gain of approximately $8 million on the sale of the Doble Watertown, MA building and land. There were no individually significant items in other (income) expenses, net, in the first quarter of 2018. 
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on EBIT, and provides EBIT on a consolidated basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, above. EBIT was $25.1 million (13.8% of net sales) for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $15.0 million (8.6% of net sales) for the first quarter of 2018. 
The following table presents a reconciliation of EBIT to net earnings. 
EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 was $3.3 million (8.0% of net sales) compared to $2.6 million (6.9% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the increased sales volumes mainly from the segment’s U.S. operations. 
-Utility Solutions Group 
EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 was $21.5 million (38.6% of net sales) compared to $10.7 million (19.1% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2018. The increase in EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to the gain on sale of the Doble Watertown facility of approximately $8 million as well as an increase in EBIT from Morgan Schaffer and the Vanguard Instruments and Manta product lines. 
-Technical Packaging 
EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 was $0.1 million (0.6% of net sales) compared to $1.0 million (4.8% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to the decrease in sales volumes at Plastique. In addition, EBIT in the first quarter of 2019 included $0.3 million of restructuring charges related to the Plastique facility consolidation, which were recorded in the first quarter of 2019. These charges consisted primarily of severance and compensation benefits and asset impairment charges. 
-Corporate 
Corporate costs included in EBIT were $10.4 million and $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in Corporate costs in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to the $1.2 million of losses on derivative instruments recorded in the first quarter of 2019. 
Interest expense was $1.9 million and $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in interest expense in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to lower average outstanding borrowings ($212 million compared to $265.7 million), partially offset by higher average interest rates (3.3% vs. 2.7%). 
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) was issued by the SEC effective December 22, 2017. SAB 118 allows registrants to record provisional amounts of the income tax effects of the TCJA where the information necessary to complete the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is not available but the amounts are based on reasonable estimates. SAB 118 permits registrants to record adjustments to its provisional amounts during the measurement period (which cannot exceed one year). 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.1 million and $17.8 million in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 was driven by lower earnings and higher working capital requirements. 
Capital expenditures were $8.9 million and $3.6 million in the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the first quarter of 2019 was mainly due to a facility expansion at TEQ ($3.8 million). In addition, the Company incurred expenditures for capitalized software of $2.1 million in both of the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Credit Facility 
At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $209 million available to borrow under its bank credit facility, a $250 million increase option subject to lender approval, and $36.6 million cash on hand. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $215 million of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility in addition to outstanding letters of credit of $8.2 million. Cash flow from operations and borrowings under the Company’s credit facility are expected to meet the Company’s capital requirements and operational needs for the foreseeable future. The Company’s ability to access the additional $250 million increase option of the credit facility is subject to acceptance by participating or other outside banks. 
New Accounting Standards 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-062, Leases (Topic 842), which, among other things, requires an entity to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. This standard will increase an entities’ reported assets and liabilities. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and mandates a modified retrospective transition period for all entities. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which eliminates the exception for all intra-entity sale of assets other than inventory. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. There was no significant impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this new standard.
