Acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc.  
On February 1, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (ESI) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 29, 2018 (the ESI Merger). At the effective time of the ESI Merger and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, each share of ESIs common stock that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger was converted into the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without interest and subject to deduction of any required withholding tax. We paid the former ESI stockholders aggregate consideration of approximately $1.033 billion, excluding related transaction fees and expenses, and non-cash consideration related to the exchange of share-based awards of approximately $31 million for a total purchase consideration of approximately $1.063 billion. We funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of our available cash on hand and the proceeds from our senior secured term loan facility as described below.  
Segments and Markets  
We have a diverse base of customers. Approximately 52% and 43% of our net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were from advanced manufacturing applications. These include, but are not limited to, industrial technologies, life and health sciences, and research and defense.  
Approximately 48% and 57% of our net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were from sales to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers.

A significant portion of our net revenues is from sales to customers in international markets. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, international net revenues accounted for approximately 52% and 50% of our total net revenues. A significant portion of our international net revenues was from Japan, Germany, China, South Korea and Israel. We expect that international net revenues will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total net revenues. Long-lived assets located in the United States were $198.7 million and $146.7 million, as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term tax-related accounts. Long-lived assets located outside of the United States were $87.5 million and $77.4 million, as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, excluding goodwill and intangibles, and long-term tax-related accounts.  
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU), Leases, (ASU 2016-02), to enhance the transparency and comparability of financial reporting related to leasing arrangements. We adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, or the effective date, and used the effective date as our date of initial application.  
At the inception of an arrangement, we determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the facts and circumstances present. Most leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, short-term lease liabilities and long-term lease liabilities. We have elected not to recognize on the balance sheet leases with terms of one year or less. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining fixed lease term. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received. In calculating the present value of future lease payments, we utilize our incremental borrowing rates, which are the rates incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. We have elected to utilize a single blended interest rate based on currencies, geographies and lease terms that comprise the lease portfolio.  
Although separation of lease and non-lease components is required, certain practical expedients are available. Entities may elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components. We have elected to account for the lease and non-lease components of each of our operating leases as a single lease component and allocate all of the contract consideration to the lease component only. The lease component results in an operating right-of-use asset being recorded on the balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis as lease expense.

Net Revenues  
Table of Contents 
Total international net revenues, including product and service, were $239.2 million and $277.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year. This decrease of $38.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was primarily due to decreases in net revenues in North America.  
Gross profit as a percentage of net product revenues decreased by 5.2 percentage points for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due lower revenue volumes and lower factory utilization.  
Gross profit as a percentage of net service revenues decreased by 1.7 percentage points for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable product mix partially offset by favorable absorption.

Fees and Expenses Related to Incremental Term Loan Facility  
We recorded fees and expenses related to Amendment No. 5 to our senior secured term loan facility, as described below, which related to the ESI Merger, during the three months ended March 31, 2019.  
Acquisition and Integration Costs  
We recorded acquisition and integration costs related to the ESI Merger, which closed on February 1, 2019, during the three months ended March 31, 2019. These costs consisted primarily of compensation costs for certain executives from ESI who had change in control provisions in their respective ESI employment agreements that were accounted for as dual-trigger arrangements and other stock vesting accelerations, as well as consulting and professional fees associated with the ESI Merger.  
Restructuring  
Customer Contract Obligation  
We recorded a charge during the three months ended March 31, 2019 related to a contractual obligation we acquired as part of our acquisition of Newport Corporation (the Newport Merger).  
Environmental Costs  
Amortization of intangible assets increased by $4.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the ESI Merger.

Interest Expense, Net  
Interest expense, net, increased by $3.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to two months of interest expense related to Amendment No. 5 to our senior secured term loan facility, as described below.  
Other Expense, Net  
As of March 31, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $40.7 million. At December 31, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, was approximately $32.7 million. The net increase is primarily attributable the addition of historical gross unrecognized tax benefits for ESI as a result of the ESI Merger during the quarter ended March 31, 2019. As of March 31, 2019, excluding interest and penalties, there were approximately $33.1 million of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact our annual effective tax rate. We accrue interest and, if applicable, penalties for any uncertain tax positions. Interest and penalties are classified as a component of income tax expense. As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively.

Cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable investments totaled $462.3 million at March 31, 2019, compared to $718.2 million at December 31, 2018. This decrease primarily related to the $406.0 million of cash used to fund the payment of a portion of the purchase price for ESI on February 1, 2019.  
Net cash provided by operating activities was $29.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and resulted from net income of $12.5 million, which included non-cash charges of $61.6 million, offset by a net increase in working capital of $45.0 million. The net increase in working capital was primarily due to a decrease in accrued compensation of $22.9 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $17.3 million, an increase in inventories of $10.3 million and a decrease in income taxes of $3.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in other current and non-current assets of $4.8 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $4.0 million.  
Net cash provided by operating activities was $72.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and resulted from net income of $105.1 million, which included non-cash charges of $37.9 million, offset by a net increase in working capital of $70.3 million. The net increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $37.3 million and an increase in inventories of $28.2 million, related to an increase in business activities and a decrease in accrued compensation of $32.5 million, as year-end bonuses were paid. These increases in working capital were offset by an increase in other current and non-current liabilities of $10.5 million, an increase in accounts payable of $9.3 million and an increase in income taxes of $8.8 million.  
Net cash used in investing activities was $874.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and was primarily due to the payment of a portion of the purchase price for the ESI Merger of $988.6 million and purchases of production-related equipment of $14.5 million, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $129.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 due to purchases of production-related equipment of $9.4 million, offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $8.8 million.  
Net cash provided by financing activities was $618.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and was primarily from net proceeds of $638.6 million mainly from our 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, as described below, used to finance the ESI Merger, partially offset by net payments related to tax payments for employee stock awards of $9.0 million and dividend payments of $10.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $67.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and resulted from partial repayment of the Term Loan Facility, as described below, of $50.0 million, dividend payments made to common stockholders of $9.8 million and net payments related to tax payments for employee stock awards of $8.9 million, partially offset by a net increase in proceeds from short-term borrowings relating to our lines of credit of $1.6 million.

On May 8, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on June 7, 2019 to shareholders of record as of May 27, 2019. Future dividend declarations, if any, as well as the record and payment dates for such dividends, are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. In addition, under the terms of our senior secured Term Loan Facility and our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, we may be restricted from paying dividends under certain circumstances.  
We subsequently entered into four separate repricing amendments to the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which decreased the applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings from 4.0% to 1.75%, with a LIBOR rate floor of 0.75%. As a consequence of the pricing of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility (defined below), the applicable margin for the 2016 Term Loan Facility was increased to 2.00% (from 1.75%) with respect to LIBOR borrowings and 1.00% (from 0.75%) with respect to base rate borrowings. The interest rate on the 2016 Term Loan Facility as of March 31, 2019 was 4.5%.  
In September 2016, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of September 30, 2020, to fix the rate on $335.0 million of the then-outstanding balance under the 2016 Term Loan Facility. The rate is fixed at 1.198% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 2.0% at March 31, 2019. The notional amount of the interest rate swap agreement was $290.0 million and had a fair value of $4.5 million at March 31, 2019.  
As of March 31, 2019, after total principal prepayments of $425.0 million and regularly scheduled principal payments of $6.5 million, the total outstanding principal balance of the 2016 Term Loan Facility was $348.5 million. As a result of making these prepayments, we are no longer required to make any regularly scheduled principal payments on the 2016 Term Loan Facility until the maturity date of the loan.  
We incurred $28.7 million of deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method. A portion of these fees have been accelerated in connection with the various debt prepayments during 2016, 2017 and 2018. As of March 31, 2019, the remaining balance of the deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the 2016 Term Loan Facility was $4.0 million.  
On February 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the ESI Merger, we entered into an amendment (Amendment No. 5) to the Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 5 provided an additional tranche B-5 term loan commitment in the principal amount of $650.0 million (the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility), all of which was drawn down in connection with the closing of the ESI Merger. Pursuant to Amendment No. 5, we also effectuated certain amendments to the Credit Agreement which make certain of the negative covenants and other provisions less restrictive. The 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility matures on February 1, 2026 and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, a base rate or LIBOR rate (as described above) plus, in each case, an applicable margin equal to 1.25% with respect to base rate borrowings and 2.25% with respect to LIBOR borrowings. The 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility was issued with original issue discount of 1.00% of the principal amount thereof.  
On April 3, 2019, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of March 31, 2023, to fix the rate on $300.0 million of the outstanding balance of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility. The rate is fixed at 2.309% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 2.25% at March 31, 2019.  
We incurred $11.4 million of deferred finance fees and original issue discount fees related to the term loans under the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method. As of March 31, 2019, the remaining balance of the deferred finance fees and original issue discount related to the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility was $11.2 million.

Under the Credit Agreement, we are required to prepay outstanding term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, subject to certain exceptions, with portions of its annual excess cash flow as well as with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, certain casualty and condemnation events and the incurrence or issuance of certain debt. As a result of our Total Leverage Ratio, we were not required to make a prepayment of excess cash flow for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  
All obligations under the Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries, and are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and the assets of such subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions.  
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. If an event of default occurs, the Lenders under the Term Loan Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Term Loan Facility and all actions generally permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. At March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.  
In addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal under the ABL Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder equal to 0.25% per annum. We must also pay customary letter of credit fees and agency fees.  
We incurred $0.8 million of costs in connection with the new ABL Facility, which were capitalized and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized to interest expense over the contractual term of five years of the ABL Facility. As a result of the prior asset-based facility being terminated, we wrote off $0.2 million of previously capitalized debt issuance costs. 
The ABL Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the ABL Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the ABL Facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). This standard better aligns an entitys risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted this ASU during the first quarter of 2019 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This standard requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for all leases, with certain exceptions, on the balance sheet. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, and used the effective date as its date of initial application. As such, we did not adjust prior period amounts. We also elected to adopt the package of practical expedients upon transition, which permits companies to not reassess lease identification, classification, and initial direct costs under ASU 2016-02 for leases that commenced prior to the effective date. We implemented internal controls and a lease accounting information system to enable preparation on adoption. Upon adoption, we recorded a cumulative effect of initially applying this new standard, resulting in the addition of $71.0 million of right-of-use assets and $20.2 million and $54.1 million of corresponding short-term and long-term lease liabilities, respectively. The right-of-use asset is net of the deferred rent liability, prepaid rent and net favorable lease asset which were re-classified to the right-of-use asset upon adoption of the standard. For additional information on the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this standard, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.
