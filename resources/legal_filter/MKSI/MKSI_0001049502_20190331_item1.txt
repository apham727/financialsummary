Basis of Presentation  
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
In October 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). This standard permits the use of the Overnight Index Swap Rate (OIS) based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815 in addition to the interest rates on direct treasury obligations of the U.S. government, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) swap rate, the OIS rate based on the Federal Funds Effective Rate and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Rate. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this ASU during the first quarter of 2019 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). This standard better aligns an entitys risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this ASU during the first quarter of 2019 and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This standard requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for all leases, with certain exceptions, on the balance sheet. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, and used the effective date as its date of initial application. As such, the Company did not adjust prior period amounts. The Company also elected to adopt the package of practical expedients upon transition, which permits companies to not reassess lease identification, classification, and initial direct costs under ASU 2016-02 for leases that commenced prior to the effective date. The Company implemented internal controls and a lease accounting information system to enable

 preparation on adoption. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of initially applying this new standard, resulting in the addition of $71,042 of right-of-use assets and $20,192 and $54,147 of short-term and long-term lease liabilities, respectively. The right-of-use asset is net of the deferred rent liability, prepaid rent and a net favorable lease asset which were re-classified to the right-of-use asset upon adoption of the standard. For additional information on the required disclosures related to the impact of adopting this standard, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.  
The Company has operating leases for real estate and non-real estate, which are comprised of automobiles, in North America, Europe, and Asia. The Company does not have any finance leases.  
The Company has lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components, has elected to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component, and has allocated all of the contract consideration to the lease component only. The Company has existing net leases in which the non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance, maintenance, consumables, etc.) are paid separately from rent based on actual costs incurred. Therefore, non-lease components are not included in the right-of-use asset and lease liability and are reflected as expenses in the periods incurred.  
The Company has existing leases that include variable lease and non-lease components that are not included in the right-of-use asset and lease liability, and are reflected as expenses in the periods incurred. Such payments primarily include common area maintenance charges and increases in rent payments that are driven by factors such as future changes in an index (e.g., the Consumer Price Index).

Interest Rate Swap Agreement  
On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix the rate on approximately 50% of its then-outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement, as described further in Note 11. This hedge fixes the interest rate paid on the hedged debt at 1.198% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 2.0% as of March 31, 2019, through September 30, 2020. The interest rate swap is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI). To the extent that this arrangement is no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs. At March 31, 2019, the notional amount of this transaction was $290,000 and had a fair value of $4,459. At December 31, 2018, the notional amount of this transaction was $290,000 and had a fair value of $6,083.

Inventories  
On February 1, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (ESI) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 29, 2018 (the Merger Agreement), by and among the Company, EAS Equipment, Inc., formerly a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and ESI (the ESI Merger). At the effective time of the ESI Merger and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each share of ESIs common stock that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger was converted into the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without interest and subject to deduction of any required withholding tax.  
The aggregate consideration of approximately $1,032,671, excluding related transaction fees and expenses, and non-cash consideration related to the exchange of share-based awards of approximately $30,630 for a total purchase consideration of approximately $1,063,301. The Company funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of the Companys available cash on hand and the proceeds from the Companys senior secured term loan facility described in Note 11.

The fair value write-up of acquired finished goods inventory and demonstration inventory was $8,383, the amount of which will be expensed over the period during which the acquired inventory is sold. Accordingly, for the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $5,140 incremental cost of sales charge associated with the fair value write-up of inventory acquired in the ESI Merger.  
The fair value write-up of acquired property, plant and equipment of $26,667 will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable assets. Property, plant and equipment is valued at its value-in-use, unless there was a known plan to dispose of the asset.  
The acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the economic use of the asset.

Certain executives from ESI had severance provisions in their respective ESI employment agreements. The agreements included terms that were accounted for as dual-trigger arrangements. Through the Companys acquisition accounting, the expense relating to these benefits was recognized in the combined entitys financial statements. The Company recorded costs of $2,701 and $14,023 in acquisition and integration costs as compensation expense and stock-based compensation expense, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2019 associated with these severance provisions.

The Company subsequently entered into four separate repricing amendments to the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which decreased the applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings from 4.0% to 1.75%, with a LIBOR rate floor of 0.75%. As a consequence of the pricing of the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility (defined below), the applicable margin for the 2016 Term Loan Facility was increased to 2.00% (from 1.75%) with respect to LIBOR borrowings and 1.00% (from 0.75%) with respect to base rate borrowings. The interest rate on the 2016 Term Loan Facility as of March 31, 2019 was 4.5%.

As a result of making these prepayments, the Company is no longer required to make any regularly scheduled principal payments on the 2016 Term Loan Facility until the maturity date of the loan.  
The Company incurred $28,747 of deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method.

As of March 31, 2019, the remaining balance of the deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the 2016 Term Loan Facility was $3,980.  
On February 1, 2019, in connection with the completion of the ESI Merger, the Company entered into an amendment (Amendment No. 5) to the Credit Agreement. Amendment No. 5 provided an additional tranche B-5 term loan commitment in the principal amount of $650,000 (the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility), all of which was drawn down in connection with the closing of the ESI Merger. Pursuant to Amendment No. 5, the Company also effectuated certain amendments to the Credit Agreement which make certain of the negative covenants and other provisions less restrictive. The 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility matures on February 1, 2026 and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Companys option, a base rate or LIBOR rate (as described above) plus, in each case, an applicable margin equal to 1.25% with respect to base rate borrowings and 2.25% with respect to LIBOR borrowings. The 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility was issued with original issue discount of 1.00% of the principal amount thereof.  
The Company incurred $11,362 of deferred finance fees and original issue discount fees related to the term loans under the 2019 Incremental Term Loan Facility, which are included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method.

As a result the Companys Total Leverage Ratio, it was not required to make a prepayment of excess cash flow for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  
All obligations under the Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by certain of the Companys domestic subsidiaries, and are collateralized by substantially all of the Companys assets and the assets of such subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions.  
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. If an event of default occurs, the Lenders under the Term Loan Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Term Loan Facility and all actions generally permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. At March 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.  
In connection with the completion of the Newport Merger in April 2016, the Company entered into an asset-based credit agreement with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, the other borrowers from time to time party thereto, and the lenders and letters of credit issuers from time to time party thereto, that provided senior secured financing of up to $50,000, which the Company never borrowed against.

Net Income Per Share  
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding (using the treasury stock method) if securities containing potentially dilutive common shares (restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights) had been converted to such common shares, and if such assumed conversion is dilutive.  
Stock-Based Compensation  
The Company grants restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and directors under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan). The 2014 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. The 2014 Plan is intended to attract and retain employees and directors, and to provide an incentive for these individuals to assist the Company to achieve long-range performance goals and to enable these individuals to participate in the long-term growth of the Company.  
all RSUs that vest based solely on the satisfaction of service conditions, granted under any ESI equity plan, arrangement or agreement (ESI Plan) that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger, and as to which shares of ESI common stock were not fully distributed in connection with the closing of the ESI Merger,  
all RSUs that were granted subject to vesting based on both the achievement of performance goals and the satisfaction of service conditions granted under any ESI Plan that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger, and  
all stock appreciation rights (SARs) granted under any ESI Plan, whether vested or unvested, that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the ESI Merger and held by an individual who was a service provider of ESI as of the date on which the effective time of the ESI Merger occurred.  
The shares of the Companys common stock that are subject to the Assumed SARs and the Assumed RSUs are issuable pursuant to the Companys 2014 Plan.

Newport Litigation  
In March 2016, two putative class actions lawsuit captioned Dixon Chung v. Newport Corp., et al., Case No. A-16-733154-C, and Hubert C. Pincon v. Newport Corp., et al., Case No. A-16-734039-B, were filed in the District Court, Clark County, Nevada on behalf of a putative class of stockholders of Newport for claims related to the merger agreement (Newport Merger Agreement) between the Company, Newport, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Merger Sub). The lawsuits named as defendants the Company, Newport, Merger Sub, and certain then current and former members of Newports board of directors. Both complaints alleged that Newport directors breached their fiduciary duties to Newports stockholders by agreeing to sell Newport through an inadequate and unfair process, which led to inadequate and unfair consideration, by agreeing to unfair deal protection devices and by omitting material information from the proxy statement. The complaints also alleged that the Company, Newport, and Merger Sub aided and abetted the directors alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties. The complaints sought injunctive relief, including to enjoin or rescind the Newport Merger Agreement, and an award of attorneys and other fees and costs, among other relief. On April 14, 2016, the Court consolidated the actions.  
On October 19, 2016, plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed an amended complaint captioned In re Newport Corporation Shareholder Litigation, Case No. A-16-733154-B, in the District Court, Clark County, Nevada, on behalf of a putative class of Newports stockholders for claims related to the Newport Merger Agreement. The amended complaint contained substantially similar allegations related to Newports former board of directors alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties to Newports stockholders. The amended complaint sought monetary damages, including pre- and post-judgment interest. On June 22, 2017, the Court granted Defendants motion to dismiss and dismissed the amended complaint against all defendants but granted plaintiffs leave to amend.  
On July 27, 2017, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint containing substantially similar allegations but naming only Newports former directors as defendants. On August 8, 2017, the Court dismissed the Company and Newport from the action. The second amended complaint seeks monetary damages, including pre- and post-judgment interest. The Court granted a motion for class certification on September 27, 2018, appointing Mr. Pincon and Locals 302 and 612 of the International Union of Operating Engineers - Employers Construction Industry Retirement Trust as class representatives. On June 11, 2018, plaintiff Dixon Chung was voluntarily dismissed from the litigation. Discovery is ongoing in this action.
