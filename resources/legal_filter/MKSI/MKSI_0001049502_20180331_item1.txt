Reclassification of certain line items in prior period financial statements  
 2) Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement  Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220). The amendments in this standard allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Act. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)-Scope of Modification Accounting. This standard provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this ASU during the three month period ended March 31, 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)-Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. This standard requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost. This standard also provides explicit guidance on how to present the service cost component and the other components of the net benefit cost in the income statement and allows only the service cost component of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this ASU during the three month period ended March 31, 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805)-Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This standard clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. This standard also provides a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business. Because the current definition of a business is interpreted broadly and can be difficult to apply, stakeholders indicated that analyzing transactions is inefficient and costly and that the definition does not permit the use of reasonable judgment. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this ASU during the three month period ended March 31, 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)-Restricted Cash, an amendment to ASU 2016-15. This standard requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied at the time of adoption of ASU 2016-15. The Company adopted this ASU during the three month period ended March 31, 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740)-Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other Than Inventory. This standard requires that an entity recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs as opposed to when the assets have been sold to an outside party. The provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this ASU during the three month period ended March 31, 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)-Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This standard addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of addressing the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230. The  
 provisions of this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this ASU during the three month period ended March 31, 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This standard requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for all leases, with certain exceptions, on the balance sheet. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The FASB issued additional updates to the new standard in Topic 842 relating to a practical expedients for land easements (Update 2018-01 in January 2018). The Company has reviewed the requirements of this standard and has formulated a plan for implementation. The management team has communicated its approach to the Audit Committee and will provide regular updates as appropriate. The Company is currently working at accumulating a complete population of leases from all of its locations. The Company has selected a software repository to track all of its lease agreements and to assist in the reporting and disclosure requirements required by the standard. The Company will continue to assess and disclose the impact that this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements, disclosures and related controls, when known.  
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10)-Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This ASU provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The new standard revises accounting related to equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value. Among other things, it amends the presentation and disclosure requirements of equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method. Changes in the fair value of these equity securities will be recognized directly in net income. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this ASU during the three month period ended March 31, 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASC 606). This ASU provides for a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and has replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. The Company used the modified retrospective method upon adoption in the first quarter of 2018. The FASB issued additional updates to the new revenue standard in Topic 606 relating to reporting revenue on a gross versus net basis (Update 2016-08 in March 2016), identifying performance obligations and licensing arrangements (Update 2016-10 in April 2016), narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients (Update 2016-12 in May 2016), technical corrections and improvements (Update 2016-20 in December 2016), and SEC Updates (Update 2017-13 in September 2017 and Update 2017-14 in November 2017). The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements as described further in Note 3.  
 3) Revenue from Contracts with Customers  
The Company adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. The reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 reflect the application of ASC 606 guidance while the reported results for 2017 were prepared under the guidance of ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605).  
      Identify the contract with a customer  
      Identify the performance obligations in the contract  
      Determine the transaction price  
      Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract  
      Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation  
Revenue under ASC 606 is recognized when or as obligations under the terms of a contract with the Companys customer have been satisfied and control has transferred to the customer. The majority of the Companys performance obligations, and associated revenue, are transferred to customers at a point in time, generally upon shipment of a product to the customer or receipt of the product by the customer and without significant judgments. Installation services are not significant and are usually completed in a short period of time (normally less than two weeks) and therefore, recorded at a point in time when the installation services are completed, rather than over time as they are not material. Extended warranty, service contracts, and repair services, which are transferred to the customer over time, are recorded as revenue as the services are performed. For repair services, the Company makes an accrual at quarter end based upon historical repair times within its product groups to record revenue based upon the estimated number of days completed to date, which is consistent with ratable recognition. Customized products with no alternative future use to the Company, and that have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, are also recorded over time. The Company considers this to be a faithful depiction of the transfer to the customer of revenue over time as the work or service is performed.  
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the products or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the product or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Sales, value add, and other taxes the Company collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. The Companys normal payment terms are 30 to 60 days but vary by the type and location of its customers and the products or services offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, the Company requires payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. None of the Companys contracts as of March 31, 2018 contain a significant financing component. Contract assets as of January 1 and March 31, 2018 were immaterial and included in other current assets.  
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations  
Deferred Revenues  
The Companys standard assurance warranty period is normally 12 to 24 months. The Company sells separately-priced service contracts and extended warranty contracts related to certain of its products, especially its laser products. The separately priced contracts generally range from 12 to 60 months. The Company normally receives payment at the inception of the contract and recognizes revenue over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in satisfying the obligations under the contract. The Company has elected to use the practical expedient related to disclosing the remaining performance obligations as of March 31, 2018, as the majority have a duration of less than one year.  
   (1)  Beginning deferred revenue as of January 1, 2018 includes $11,322 of current deferred revenue and $3,126 of long-term deferred revenue.  
   (2)  Ending deferred revenue as of March 31, 2018 includes $14,003 of current deferred revenue and $3,327 of long-term deferred revenue.  
Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract  
Disaggregation of Revenue  
Refer to Note 17 in the financial statements for revenue by reportable segment, geography and groupings of similar products.  
 5) Fair Value Measurements  
 Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities assessed as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
 Level 2   Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments or securities or derivative contracts that are valued using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. 
 Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.  
   (1)  The cash and cash equivalent amounts presented in the table above do not include cash of $294,903 and non-negotiable time deposits of $1,660 as of March 31, 2018.  
   (1)  The cash and cash equivalent amounts presented in the table above do not include cash of $292,808 and non-negotiable time deposits of $3,398 as of December 31, 2017.  
Available-For-Sale Investments  
Available-for-sale investments consisted of time deposits and drafts, certificates of deposit, bankers acceptance drafts, asset-backed securities (which include auto loans, credit card receivables and equipment trust receivables), commercial paper, corporate obligations, municipal bonds, U.S. treasury obligations and U.S. agency obligations.  
The Company measures its debt and equity investments at fair value. The Companys available-for-sale investments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  
Israeli Pension Assets  
Israeli pension assets represent investments in mutual funds, government securities and other time deposits. These investments are set aside for the retirement benefit of the employees at the Companys Israeli subsidiaries. These funds are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  
By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. The Company enters into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions, for which no collateral is required. The Company has policies to monitor the credit risk of these counterparties. While there can be no assurance, the Company does not anticipate any material non-performance by any of these counterparties.  
Interest Rate Swap Agreement  
On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix the rate on approximately 50% of its then-outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement, as described further in Note 10. This hedge fixes the interest rate paid on the hedged debt at 1.198% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 2.00% as of March 31, 2018, through September 30, 2020. The interest rate swap is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI). To the extent that this arrangement is no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs. The notional amount of this transaction was $305,000 and had a fair value of $8,170 at March 31, 2018. The notional amount of this transaction was $305,000 and had a fair value of $6,179 at December 31, 2017.  
Foreign Exchange Contracts  
The Company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency-denominated intercompany sales of inventory, over a maximum period of eighteen months, using forward foreign exchange contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges related to Japanese, South Korean, British, Euro and Taiwanese currencies. To the extent these derivatives are effective in off-setting the variability of the  
   (1)  Represents the receivable (payable) amount included in the consolidated balance sheet.  
The net amount of existing gains as of March 31, 2018 that the Company expects to reclassify from OCI into earnings within the next twelve months is immaterial.  
Sale of Data Analytics Solutions  
 9) Goodwill and Intangible Assets  
   (1)  In 2017, the Company sold its Data Analytics business and, as a result, charged the related goodwill of $(3,115) to the gain on sale of business.  
Intangible Assets  
Aggregate amortization expense related to acquired intangibles for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $11,190 and $12,501, respectively. The amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, was net of $185 and  
On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which has a maturity date of September 30, 2020, to fix the rate on $335,000 of the then-outstanding balance of the Credit Agreement. The rate is fixed at 1.198% per annum plus the applicable credit spread, which was 2.00% at March 31, 2018. The notional amount of this transaction was $305,000 and had a fair value of $8,170 at March 31, 2018.  
On December 14, 2016, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 (the Repricing Amendment 2) to the Credit Agreement by and among the Company, the Lenders and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders. The Repricing Amendment 2 decreased the applicable margin for the Companys term loan under the Credit Agreement to 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings and 1.75% for base rate borrowings and reset the period during which a prepayment premium may be required for a Repricing Transaction until six months after the effective date of the Repricing Amendment 2. In November 2016, prior to the effectiveness of the Repricing Amendment 2, the Company prepaid an additional $40,000 of principal under the Credit Agreement. In March 2017, the Company prepaid an additional $50,000 of principal under the Credit Agreement.  
In July 2017, August 2017, November 2017 and March 2018 the Company prepaid $50,000, $75,000, $50,000 and $50,000, respectively, of principal under the Credit Agreement. As of March 31, 2018, after total prepayments of $425,000 and regularly scheduled principal payments of $6,536, the total outstanding principal balance was $348,464. The interest rate as of March 31, 2018 was 3.648%.  
The Company incurred $28,747 of deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fees related to the term loans under the Term Loan Facility, which is included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the term loans using the effective interest method. A portion of these fees has been accelerated in connection with the various debt prepayments during 2016, 2017 and 2018. As of March 31, 2018, the remaining balance of the deferred finance fees, original issue discount and repricing fee related to the Term Loan Facility was $7,226.  
Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with portions of its annual excess cash flow as well as with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, certain casualty and condemnation events and the incurrence or issuance of certain debt. The Company is also required to make scheduled quarterly payments each equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the term loans outstanding, less the amount of certain voluntary and mandatory repayments after such date, with the balance due on the seventh anniversary of the closing date. As a result of making total prepayments of $425,000 through March 31, 2018, the Company is no longer required to make any scheduled principal payments until maturity date of the loan.  
All obligations under the Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by certain of the Companys domestic subsidiaries, and are collateralized by substantially all of the Companys assets and the assets of such subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions.  
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. If an event of default occurs, the Lenders under the Term Loan Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Term Loan Facility and all actions generally permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. At March 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.  
 adjusted for certain additional costs, plus an initial applicable margin of 1.75%. Commencing with the completion of the first fiscal quarter ending after the closing of the ABL Facility, the applicable margin for borrowings thereunder is subject to upward or downward adjustment each fiscal quarter, based on the average historical excess availability during the preceding quarter.  
The Company incurred $1,201 of costs in connection with the ABL Facility, which were capitalized and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method over the contractual term of five years of the ABL Facility.  
In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the ABL Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The initial commitment fee is 0.375% per annum. The total commitment fee recognized in interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $95. Commencing with the completion of the first fiscal quarter ending after the closing of the ABL Facility, the commitment fee is subject to downward adjustment based on the amount of average unutilized commitments for the three month period immediately preceding such adjustment date. The Company must also pay customary letter of credit fees and agency fees.  
One of the Companys Japanese subsidiaries has lines of credit and short-term borrowing arrangements with two financial institutions, which arrangements generally expire and are renewed at three month intervals. The lines of credit provided for aggregate borrowings as of March 31, 2018 of up to an equivalent of $21,641 U.S. dollars. One of the borrowing arrangements has an interest rate based on the Tokyo Interbank Offer Rate at the time of borrowing and the other has an interest rate based on the Japanese Short-Term Prime Lending Rate. Total borrowings outstanding under these arrangements were $941 at March 31, 2018. There were no borrowings outstanding under these arrangements at December 31, 2017.  
The Company assumed various revolving lines of credit and a financing facility with the completion of the Newport Merger.

The Companys contributions to these plans for both the three month period ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, as required by local pension accounting laws, were immaterial.  
 14) Net Income Per Share  
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding  
Cash Dividends  
The Company has granted Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) to employees and directors under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan). The 2014 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. The 2014 Plan is intended to attract and retain employees and directors, and to provide an incentive for these individuals to assist the Company to achieve long-range performance goals and to enable these individuals to participate in the long-term growth of the Company.  
● all RSUs granted under any Newport equity plan that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Newport Merger, and as to which shares of Newport common stock were not fully distributed in connection with the closing of the Newport Merger, and

 19) Commitments and Contingencies  
On March 9, 2016, a putative class action lawsuit captioned Dixon Chung v. Newport Corp., et al., Case No. A-16-733154-C, was filed in the District Court, Clark County, Nevada on behalf of a putative class of stockholders of Newport for claims related to the  
 Merger Agreement between the Company, Newport, and Merger Sub. On March 25, 2016, a second putative class action complaint captioned Hubert C. Pincon v. Newport Corp., et al., Case No. A-16-734039-B, was filed in the District Court, Clark County, Nevada, on behalf of a putative class of Newports stockholders for claims related to the Merger Agreement. The lawsuits named as defendants the Company, Newport, Merger Sub, and certain then current and former members of Newports board of directors. Both complaints alleged that the directors breached their fiduciary duties to Newports stockholders by agreeing to sell Newport through an inadequate and unfair process, which led to inadequate and unfair consideration, by agreeing to unfair deal protection devices, and by omitting material information from the proxy statement. The complaints also alleged that the Company, Newport, and Merger Sub aided and abetted the directors alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties. The complaints sought injunctive relief, including to enjoin or rescind the Merger Agreement, and an award of attorneys and other fees and costs, among other relief. On April 14, 2016, the Court granted plaintiffs motion to consolidate the Pincon and Chung actions.  
On October 19, 2016, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint captioned In re Newport Corporation Shareholder Litigation, Case No. A-16-733154-B, in the District Court, Clark County, Nevada, on behalf of a putative class of Newports stockholders for claims related to the Merger Agreement. The complaint named as defendants the Company, Newport, and the then-current members of Newports former board of directors. It alleged that the named directors breached their fiduciary duties to Newports stockholders by agreeing to sell Newport through an inadequate and unfair process, which led to inadequate and unfair consideration, by agreeing to unfair deal protection devices, and by omitting material information from the proxy statement. The complaint also alleged that the Company and Newport aided and abetted the named directors alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties. The complaint sought monetary damages, including pre- and post-judgment interest. On December 9, 2016, defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint, which plaintiffs opposed. On June 22, 2017, the Court dismissed the amended complaint against all defendants but granted plaintiffs leave to amend.  
On July 27, 2017, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, which names as defendants certain former directors of Newport. On August 8, 2017, the Court dismissed the Company and Newport from the action pursuant to stipulations among the parties. The second amended complaint alleges that the directors breached their fiduciary duties to Newports stockholders by agreeing to sell Newport through an inadequate and unfair process, which led to inadequate and unfair consideration, and by omitting material information from the proxy statement.
