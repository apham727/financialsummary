Overview



Company



Acuity Brands is the parent company of Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. (“ABL”) and other subsidiaries (Acuity Brands, ABL, and such other subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the “Company”).
The Company has its principal office in Atlanta, Georgia.
The Company is one of the world’s leading providers of lighting and building management solutions and services for commercial, institutional, industrial, infrastructure, and residential applications throughout North America and select international markets.
The Company’s lighting and building management solutions include devices such as luminaires, lighting controls, controllers for various building systems, power supplies, prismatic skylights, and drivers, as well as integrated systems designed to optimize energy efficiency and comfort for various indoor and outdoor applications.
Additionally, the Company continues to expand its solutions portfolio to provide a host of other economic benefits, including software and services that enable the Internet of Things (“IoT”).
The Company's IoT solutions provide customers with access to robust data analytics; support the advancement of smart buildings, smart cities, and the smart grid; and allow businesses to develop custom applications to scale their operations.
As of February 28, 2018, the Company operates 19 manufacturing facilities and seven distribution facilities along with one warehouse to serve its extensive customer base.
The Company does not consider acquisitions a critical element of its strategy but seeks opportunities to expand and enhance its portfolio of solutions, including the acquisition of Lucid Design Group, Inc. (“Lucid”) on February 12, 2018, using cash on hand.
Lucid is headquartered in Oakland, California and provides a data and analytics platform to make data-driven decisions to improve building efficiency and drive energy conservation and savings.
No acquisitions were completed during fiscal 2017.
Liquidity and Capital Resources



The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flows generated primarily from its business operations, cash on hand, and various sources of borrowings.
The ability of the Company to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to access certain capital markets, including banks, is necessary to fund its operations and capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase shares, meet its obligations as they become due, and maintain compliance with covenants contained in its financing agreements.
The Company currently expects to invest approximately two percent of net sales in capital expenditures during fiscal 2018.
For the first half of fiscal 2018, $20.9 million had been invested, primarily for equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and new and enhanced information technology capabilities.
In June 2017, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized the repurchase of two million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock in the future.
As of February 28, 2018, 1.2 million shares had been purchased under this authorization.
In March 2018, the Board authorized the repurchase of six million shares, which includes the remaining 0.8 million shares available for repurchase under the June 2017 authorization.
The Company expects to repurchase the shares on an opportunistic basis.
The Company's short-term cash needs are expected to include funding operations as currently planned, making anticipated capital investments, paying quarterly stockholder dividends as currently anticipated, paying principal and interest on borrowings as currently scheduled, making required contributions to its employee benefit plans, funding possible acquisitions, and potentially repurchasing up to six million shares of its outstanding common stock as authorized by the Board.
Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its liquidity needs over the next 12 months based on its cash on hand, current projections of cash flow from operations, and borrowing availability under existing financing arrangements, as well as potential additional borrowings for stock repurchases.
The type of debt instruments, amount, terms, and timing of additional borrowings will be dependent on the extent of share 



24

repurchase activity.
Additionally, management believes that the Company’s cash flows from operations and sources of funding, including, but not limited to, future borrowings and capacity, will sufficiently support the long-term liquidity needs of the Company.
Cash Flow



The Company uses available cash and cash flow from operations, as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options, to fund operations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, repurchase Company stock, and pay dividends.
The Company’s cash position at February 28, 2018 was $229.8 million, a decrease of $81.3 million from August 31, 2017.
During the six months ended February 28, 2018, the Company generated net cash flows from operations of $178.3 million.
Cash generated from operating activities, as well as cash on-hand, was used during the current period primarily to repurchase 1.2 million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock for $194.3 million, to fund acquisitions of $26.4 million, to fund capital expenditures of $20.9 million, to pay dividends to stockholders of $10.9 million, and to pay employee taxes on the net settlement of equity awards of $6.7 million.
The Company generated $178.3 million of cash flow from operating activities during the six months ended February 28, 2018 compared with $90.0 million in the prior-year period, an increase of $88.3 million, due primarily to lower operating working capital requirements and lower variable incentive payments for prior year performance.
Operating working capital (calculated by adding accounts receivable plus inventories, and subtracting accounts payable-net of acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes) decreased approximately $26.0 million during the first six months of fiscal 2018 compared to a $22.0 million increase during the first six months of fiscal 2017.
Operating working capital during the six months ended February 28, 2018 was favorably impacted by a reduction in inventory, driven primarily by reduced on-hand raw materials and work in process.
Management believes that investing in assets and programs that will over time increase the overall return on its invested capital is a key factor in driving stockholder value.
The Company invested $20.9 million and $35.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily related to investments in new equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and information technology.
The Company expects to invest approximately two percent of net sales primarily for new equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and information technology capabilities during fiscal 2018.
Capitalization



The current capital structure of the Company is comprised principally of senior unsecured notes and equity of its stockholders.
Total debt outstanding was $356.9 million at February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, and consisted primarily of fixed-rate obligations.
On December 8, 2009, ABL issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes due in fiscal 2020 (the “Unsecured Notes”) in a private placement transaction.
The Unsecured Notes were subsequently exchanged for SEC-registered notes with substantially identical terms.
The Unsecured Notes bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum and were issued at a price equal to 99.797% of their face value and for a term of 10 years.
See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
On August 27, 2014, the Company executed a revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) with a borrowing capacity of $250.0 million.
The Revolving Credit Facility will mature and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on August 27, 2019.
The Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of February 28, 2018.
The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility as of February 28, 2018.
At February 28, 2018, the Company had additional borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility of $244.7 million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the time, which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility less outstanding letters of credit of $5.3 million issued under the Revolving Credit Facility.
As of February 28, 2018, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $10.2 million, primarily for securing collateral requirements under the Company's casualty insurance programs and for providing credit support for the Company’s industrial revenue bond, including $5.3 million issued under the Revolving Credit Facility.
See the Debt footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
25

During the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company’s consolidated stockholders’ equity decreased $29.8 million to $1.64 billion at February 28, 2018, from $1.67 billion at August 31, 2017.
The decrease was due primarily to share repurchases, the payment of dividends, shares withheld for employee taxes on vested restricted stock grants, and foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by net income earned in the period, stock issuances resulting primarily from the exercise of stock options, and amortization of pension plan prior service costs and actuarial losses.
The Company’s debt to total capitalization ratio (calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total stockholders’ equity) was 17.9% and 17.6% at February 28, 2018 and August 31, 2017, respectively.
The ratio of debt, net of cash, to total capitalization, net of cash, was 7.2% at February 28, 2018 and 2.7% at August 31, 2017.
Dividends



Acuity Brands paid dividends on its common stock of $10.9 million and $11.5 million ($0.26 per share) during the six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Results of Operations



Second Quarter of Fiscal 2018 Compared with Second Quarter of Fiscal 2017 



The following table sets forth information comparing the components of net income for the three months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017 (in millions except per share data):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Net sales were $832.1 million for the three months ended February 28, 2018 compared with $804.7 million reported for the three months ended February 28, 2017, an increase of $27.4 million, or 3.4%.
For the three months ended February 28, 2018, the Company reported net income of $96.9 million, an increase of $29.6 million, or 44.0%, compared with $67.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2017.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, diluted earnings per share increased 52.3% to $2.33 compared with $1.53 reported in the year-ago period.
The following table reconciles certain U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
GAAP”) financial measures to the corresponding non-U.S. GAAP measures referred to in the discussion of the Company’s results of operations, which exclude the impact of acquisition related items, amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-



26

based payment expense, special charges associated primarily with continued efforts to streamline the organization, and certain discrete income tax benefits of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”).
Primarily due to the impact of the four acquisitions completed during fiscal 2016, the Company experienced noticeable increases in amortization of acquired intangibles, share-based payments used to improve retention and align the interest of key leaders of acquired businesses, and special charges due to activities to streamline and integrate those acquisitions.
These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including adjusted gross profit and margin, adjusted selling, distribution, and administrative (“SD&A”) expenses, adjusted operating profit and margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance.
Specifically, the Company believes these non-U.S. GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into the Company's results of operations.
The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(1) Acquisition-related items include professional fees.
Unfavorable price/mix reflected changes in both product mix, which included substitutions to certain products with lower price points, and sales channel mix, which included declines in generally higher priced solutions, primarily for larger commercial projects.
Sales of LED-based products accounted for over two-thirds of total net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and approximately two-thirds of total net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.
Due to the changing dynamics of the Company's product portfolio, including the increase of integrated lighting and building management solutions, it is not possible to precisely quantify or differentiate the individual components of volume, price, and mix.

Income Taxes and Net Income



The Company’s effective income tax rate was (23.1)% and 32.3% for the three months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The effective income rate for the three months ended February 28, 2018 was significantly impacted by the provisional tax benefit estimate of $31.2 million recognized within Income tax (benefit) expense on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as a result of the TCJA, which was enacted during the quarter.
The Company currently estimates that the Company’s blended consolidated effective income tax rate, before any discrete items, will approximate 26% to 28% for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and 23% to 25% for fiscal 2019.
Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $29.6 million to $96.9 million from $67.3 million reported for the prior-year period.
The increase in net income resulted primarily from the benefit from income taxes recognized during the quarter related to the TCJA, partially offset by a decrease in operating profit.
Diluted earnings per share for the three months ended February 28, 2018 increased $0.80 to $2.33 compared with diluted earnings per share of $1.53 for the prior-year period.
Adjusted net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $78.5 million compared with $77.7 million in the prior-year period, which represented an increase of $0.8 million, or 1.0%.

Outlook



Management continues to believe the execution of the Company's strategy will provide attractive opportunities for profitable growth over the long-term.
The Company's strategy is to capitalize on market growth and share gain opportunities by continuing to expand and leverage its industry-leading lighting and building management solutions portfolio, coupled with its extensive market presence and financial strength, to produce attractive financial performance over the long-term.
These opportunities include serving its traditional new construction and renovation markets as well as leveraging its unique, technology driven solutions portfolio to capture market share in the nascent, but rapidly growing, market for data capture, analytics, and other services, transforming buildings and campuses from cost centers to strategic assets.
The current weakness in the lighting industry has created a challenging environment for managing for financial performance in the short term while continuing to invest in attractive longer-term opportunities.
In addition, management expects headwinds in the home center/showroom channel to continue in the near term, giving way to growth in the second half of calendar 2018 as the Company brings new solutions to key customers and expands its access to market in this important sales channel.
While current quoting activity for lighting equipment in portions of the non-residential market remains tepid, particularly for larger projects, both short and long-term fundamental drivers of the markets that the Company serves remain positive.
Additionally, the Company continues to see growing demand for its Atrius-based lighting solutions in certain key vertical markets.
Management expects to continue to outperform the growth rates of the markets that the Company serves by executing its strategies focused on growth opportunities for new construction and renovation projects, expansion into underpenetrated geographies and channels, and growth from the continued introduction of new lighting and building management solutions as part of the Company’s integrated, tiered solutions strategy.
Management expects to introduce products and solutions to more effectively compete in these portions of the market and to accelerate programs to reduce product and other overhead costs in order to maintain the Company’s competitiveness and drive improved profitability.
Management expects the TCJA that was passed on December 22, 2017, to favorably impact the Company’s net income, diluted earnings per share, and cash flows in future periods, due primarily to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for periods beginning January 1, 2018.
Additionally, positive business sentiment and other favorable aspects of the new tax law could incentivize additional investments in facilities and infrastructure in the U.S. that may increase future demand in the end-markets that the Company serves.
Management currently estimates that the Company’s blended consolidated effective income tax rate (“tax rate”) for full-year fiscal 2018 will approximate 26% to 28% before discrete items, compared with nearly 35% for the prior year.
Management currently estimates that the fiscal 2019 tax rate will approximate 23% to 25% before discrete items.
33

Notwithstanding the TCJA, a great amount of rhetoric and debate remains regarding a wide range of policy options with respect to monetary, regulatory, and trade, amongst others, that may be pursued by the U.S. federal government.
In light of the current weakness in the lighting industry, balanced against the Company's long-term optimism in its prospects, the Board recently increased the authorization to repurchase up to six million shares, or approximately 15%, of the Company’s outstanding common stock.
The Board believes this represents an effective use of the Company's cash flow to generate shareholder value, especially during periods of high stock price volatility.
Additionally, the Board believes that repurchases of the Company’s stock support the objective to maximize long-term stockholder value, while continuing to fund investments to better serve its customers, grow its businesses, and improve its operating and financial performance.
Management believes that repurchasing the full authorization under the program within a twelve-month period would require additional resources beyond the Company’s current available cash and borrowing capacity.
The Company may also enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate open market repurchases.
A Rule 10b5-1 plan would generally permit the Company to repurchase shares at times when it might otherwise be prevented from doing so under certain securities laws provided the plan is adopted when the Company is not in possession of material non-public information.
Shares repurchased under the authorization may be retired or used for general corporate purposes, which may include transactions related to the Company’s share-based compensation and employee benefit plans.
Management discusses the development of accounting estimates with the Company’s Audit Committee of the Board.
There have been no material changes in the Company’s critical accounting estimates during the current period.
For a detailed discussion of significant accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgment, please refer to the Company’s Form 10-K.
