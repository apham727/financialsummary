Overview



j2 Global, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“j2 Global”, “the Company”, “our”, “us” or “we”), is a leading provider of internet services.
Through our Cloud Services segment, we provide cloud services to consumers and businesses and license our intellectual property (“IP”) to third parties.
In addition, the Cloud Services segment includes fax, voice, backup, security and email marketing products.
Our Digital Media segment specializes in the technology, gaming, lifestyle and healthcare markets offering content, tools and services to consumers and businesses.
Our Cloud Services segment generates revenues primarily from customer subscription and usage fees and from IP licensing fees.
Our Digital Media segment generates revenues from advertising and sponsorships, subscription and usage fees, performance marketing and licensing fees.
In addition to growing our business organically, on a regular basis we acquire businesses to grow our customer bases, expand and diversify our service offerings, enhance our technologies, acquire skilled personnel and enter into new markets.
Our consolidated revenues are currently generated from three basic business models, each with different financial profiles and variability.
Our Cloud Services segment is driven primarily by subscription revenues that are relatively higher margin, stable and predictable from quarter to quarter with some seasonal weakness in the fourth quarter.
Our Digital Media segment is driven primarily by advertising revenues, has relatively higher sales and marketing expense and has seasonal strength in the fourth quarter.
j2 Global was incorporated in 2014 as a Delaware corporation through the creation of a new holding company structure, and our Cloud Services segment, operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, j2 Cloud Services, LLC (formerly j2 Cloud Services, Inc.), and its subsidiaries, was founded in 1995.
We manage our operations through two business segments: Cloud Services and Digital Media.

Cloud Services Segment Performance Metrics



The following table sets forth certain key operating metrics for our Cloud Services segment as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except for percentages):



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Quarterly ARPU is calculated using our standard convention of applying the average of the quarter’s beginning and ending base to the total revenue for the quarter.
We believe ARPU provides investors an understanding of the average monthly revenues we recognize associated with each Cloud Services customer.
As ARPU varies based on fixed subscription fee and variable usage components, we believe it can serve as a measure by which investors can evaluate trends in the types of services, levels of services and the usage levels of those services across our Cloud Services customer base.
(2) Cloud Services customers are defined as paying direct inward dialing numbers for fax and voice services, and direct and resellers’ accounts for other services.
(3) Cancel Rate is defined as cancels of small and medium business and individual Cloud Services customers with greater than four months of continuous service (continuous service includes Cloud Services customers administratively canceled and reactivated within the same calendar month), and enterprise Cloud Services customers beginning with their first day of service.
Calculated monthly and expressed as an average over the three months of the quarter.
Our critical accounting policies are described in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2018.
During the three months ended September 30, 2018, there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates.
The main focus of our Cloud Services offerings is to reduce or eliminate costs, increase sales and enhance productivity, mobility, business continuity and security of our customers as the technologies and devices they use evolve over time.
As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to enhance our existing offerings and offer new services to continue to satisfy the evolving needs of our customers.
In a given period, we may close greater or fewer acquisitions than in prior periods or acquisitions of greater or lesser significance than in prior periods.
Moreover, future acquisitions of businesses within this segment but with different business models may impact the segment’s overall profit margins.
Also, as IP licensing often involves litigation, the timing of licensing transactions is unpredictable and can and does vary significantly from period to period.
This variability can cause the overall segment’s financial results to materially vary from period to period.
The main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to visitors to our websites and those included within our advertising networks, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience.
As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and those included within our advertising networks.
The operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our websites is significantly higher than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from those placed on third-party websites.
Growth in advertising revenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from third-party websites.
However, the trend in advertising spend is shifting to mobile devices and other newer advertising formats which generally experience lower margins than those from desktop computers and tablets.
We expect this trend to continue to put pressure on our margins.
In a given period, we may close greater or fewer acquisitions than in prior periods or acquisitions of greater or lesser significance than in prior periods.
Moreover, future acquisitions of businesses within this segment but with different business models may impact the segment’s overall profit margins.
j2 Global Consolidated



We anticipate that the stable revenue trend in our Cloud Services segment combined with the improving revenue and profits in our Digital Media segment will result in overall improved revenue and profits for j2 Global on a consolidated basis, excluding the impact of any future acquisitions which can vary dramatically from period to period.

Revenues



(in thousands, except percentages)



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Our revenues consist of revenues from our Cloud Services segment and from our Digital Media segment.
Cloud Services revenues primarily consist of revenues from “fixed” customer subscription revenues and “variable” revenues generated from actual usage of our services.
Digital Media revenues is primarily derived from advertising revenues and subscription to services and information revenues consisting of fees paid for generating business leads, and licensing and sale of editorial content and trademarks.
Our revenues in 2018 have increased over the comparable three and nine month periods of 2017 primarily due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth within both the Digital Media and Cloud Services segments.
The increase in cost of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with businesses acquired in and subsequent to the third quarter 2017 that resulted in additional editorial and production, network operations, and online processing fees.
Operating Expenses



Sales and Marketing.
(in thousands, except percentages)



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Our sales and marketing costs consist primarily of internet-based advertising, sales and marketing, personnel costs and other business development-related expenses.
Our internet-based advertising relationships consist primarily of fixed cost and performance-based (cost-per-impression, cost-per-click and cost-per-acquisition) advertising relationships with an array of online service providers.
Advertising cost for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was $36.3 million (primarily consists of $24.4 million of third-party advertising costs and $10.2 million of personnel costs) compared to 2017 of $35.7 million (primarily consists of $24.1 million of third-party advertising costs and $10.4 million of personnel costs).

(in thousands, except percentages)



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Our research, development and engineering costs consist primarily of personnel-related expenses.

General and Administrative.
(in thousands, except percentages)



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Our general and administrative costs consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, depreciation and amortization, changes in the fair value associated with contingent consideration, share-based compensation expense, bad debt expense, professional fees, severance and insurance costs.
The increase in general and administrative expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 versus the prior comparable periods was primarily due to additional amortization of intangible assets,



depreciation of fixed assets, personnel costs relating to businesses acquired in and subsequent to the third quarter 2017, fair



value adjustments to contingent consideration, severance costs associated with acquisitions and professional fees.
Our interest expense, net is generated primarily from interest expense due to outstanding debt, partially offset by interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments.
Interest expense, net was $15.2 million and $25.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $46.4 million and $51.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Interest expense, net decreased over the prior comparable periods primarily due to decreased interest expense associated with the extinguishment and loss of the $250 million 8.0% Senior Notes, partially offset by increased interest income on cash, cash equivalents and investments.
Other expense (income), net.
Our other expense (income), net is generated primarily from miscellaneous items, gain or losses on currency exchange and gains or losses on investments.
Other expense (income), net was $1.2 million and $(3.9) million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase in expense over the prior comparable period is due to increased losses on currency exchange in the current period compared to the prior period’s gains earned related to the sales of Cambridge BioMarketing Group, LLC (“Cambridge”) and j2 Australia Hosting Pty Ltd (dba “Web24”).
Other expense (income), net was $6.2 million and $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase in expense over the prior comparable period is due to a loss on equity securities of $3.7 million partially offset by decreased losses on currency exchange compared to the prior period’s gain related to the sales of Cambridge BioMarketing Group, LLC (“Cambridge”) and j2 Australia Hosting Pty Ltd (dba “Web24”).
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017.
The 2017 Tax Act also created a new requirement that certain income (i.e.
Consistent with guidance issued by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (“SAB 118”), the Company recorded provisional estimates for the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act in December 2017.
In addition, SAB 118 provides for a measurement period of one year from the enactment date to finalize the accounting for effects of the 2017 Tax Act.
We continue to analyze the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act and refine calculations.
The analysis included a preliminary assessment on the deductibility of certain amounts for which deferred tax assets may have been recorded.
As of December 31, 2017, we recorded an estimated tax benefit of approximately $33.3 million.
As of September 30, 2018, we did not adjust the provisional estimate related to re-measurement of deferred tax balances.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional estimate of the transition tax of $49.2 million payable over an eight year period.
As of September 30, 2018, we have not adjusted the provisional estimate of the transition tax.
Therefore, the Company did not include a provisional amount for this item in its financial statements for fiscal 2017.
Therefore, we have not determined an accounting policy on the GILTI provisions.
However, the standard requires that we reflect the impact of the GILTI provisions as a period expense until 



-44-



the accounting policy is finalized.
Therefore, we have included the provisional estimate of GILTI related to current-year operations in its estimated annual effective tax rate only and will be updating the impact and accounting policy as the analysis related to the GILTI provisions is completed.
Provision for income taxes amounted to $9.3 million and $9.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $23.4 million and $27.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our effective tax rate was 22.9% and 22.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 22.2% and 23.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The increase in our effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was primarily attributable to the following: 



1.a decrease in the portion of our income being taxed in foreign jurisdictions and subject to lower tax rates than in the U.S. (relative to income from U.S. domestic operations); partially offset by: 



2.a decrease during 2018 from the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective on January 1, 2018.
Equity Method Investment



Net loss in earnings of equity method investment.
Net loss in earnings of equity method investment is generated from our investment in the OCV Fund for which we receive annual audited financial statements.
The investment in the OCV Fund is presented net of tax and on a one-quarter lag due to the timing and availability of financial information from OCV.
The net loss in earnings of equity method investment was $0.6 million and $3.6 million, net of tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
Segment Results



Our business segments are based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance.
Our operating segments have been aggregated into two reportable business segments: (i) Cloud Services; and (ii) Digital Media.
We account for intersegment sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the segments.
Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segment’s operations.
