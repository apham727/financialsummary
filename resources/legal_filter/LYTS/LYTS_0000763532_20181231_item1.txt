A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Significant changes to our accounting policies as a result of adopting ASU-2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) are discussed below. 
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligation in its customer contracts or purchase orders. Most of the Company’s products have a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. Control is generally transferred at time of shipment when title and risk of ownership passes to the customer. For customer contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price and any discounts to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices. Payment terms are typically within 30 to 90 days from the shipping date, depending on our terms with the customer. The Company offers standard warranties that do not represent separate performance obligations. 
Installation is a separate performance obligation, except for our digital signage products. For digital signage products, installation is not a separate performance obligation as the product and installation is the combined item promised in digital signage contracts. The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties. 
Customer specific print graphics branding    
Digital signage and related media content    
The Company also offers installation services. Installation revenue is recognized over time as our customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided through the installation process. 
Disaggregation of Revenue 
The Company disaggregates the revenue from contracts with customers by the timing of revenue recognition because the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, and timing of our revenue and cash flows. The table presents a reconciliation of the disaggregation by reportable segments. 
Practical Expedients and Exemptions 
The Company’s contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, as such the Company applies the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred, and have omitted disclosures on the amount of remaining performance obligations.    
On  July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09. “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective adoption method which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. This approach was applied to contracts that were not completed as of  June 30, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning  July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period. The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $591,000 on  July 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, as described below. 
In  February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after  December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company has an implementation team tasked with reviewing our lease obligations and determining the impact of the new standard to its financial statements. The implementation team has completed a qualitative assessment of the Company’s active leases and is compiling related data in a central repository. The Company will continue to evaluate the new standard’s impact to its financial statements.  
On January 16, 2019, the Company appointed Michael C. Beck as the Company’s Senior Vice President - Operations. Mr. Beck entered into an Employment Offer Letter as of January 11, 2019 which provides that his employment with the Company shall begin on February 11, 2019. The Employment Offer Letter also defines his compensation and benefit package. 
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation within the cash flows from operating activities section and cash flows from financing activities section of the statement of cash flows. These reclassifications have no impact on net income or earnings per share.  
There was no concentration of consolidated net sales in the three and six months ended  December 31, 2018 or 2017. There was no concentration of accounts receivable at  December 31, 2018 or  June 30, 2018. 
The segment net sales reported above represent sales to external customers. Segment operating income, which is used in management’s evaluation of segment performance, represents net sales less all operating expenses. Identifiable assets are those assets used by each segment in its operations. 
The Company’s operations are located solely within North America. As a result, the geographic distribution of the Company’s net sales and long-lived assets originate within North America. 
    (a)   Includes shares accounted for like treasury stock.    
    (b)   Calculated using the “Treasury Stock” method as if dilutive securities were exercised and the funds were used to purchase common shares at the average market price during the period.    
    (c)   Options to purchase 3,536,732 common shares and 3,569,762 common shares for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in the computation of the three month diluted loss per share because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares. Additionally, options to purchase 3,356,101 common shares and 3,549,705 common shares for the six months ended at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in the computation of the six month diluted loss per share because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares. For the three months ended and the six months ended in December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the effect of dilutive securities was not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share because there was a net loss for the period.    
A sustained and significant decline in the Company’s stock price in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 led management to believe that a triggering event occurred and that an interim goodwill impairment test was required for one of the reporting units in the Lighting Segment that contains goodwill, as of  December 31, 2018. In accordance with ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” which was adopted in a prior period, the requirement to perform step 2 in the impairment test was not required. The result of the impairment test on the reporting unit in the Lighting Segment indicated that goodwill was impaired by $20,165,000. 
Amortization expense for intangible assets was $689,000 and $690,000 for the three months ended  December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $1,380 and $1,380 for the six months ended  December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Future amortization expense (in thousands) associated with these intangible assets is expected to be $2,761 in 2019, $2,687 in 2020, $2,682 in 2021, $2,460 in 2022, $2,412 in 2023, and $18,985 after 2023.  
In  February 2017, the Company amended its secured line of credit to a $100 million facility. The line of credit expires in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Interest on the revolving line of credit is charged based upon an increment over the LIBOR rate as periodically determined, or at the bank’s base lending rate, at the Company’s option. The increment over the LIBOR borrowing rate, as periodically determined, fluctuates between 125 and 250 basis points depending upon the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), as defined in the line of credit agreement. The increment over LIBOR borrowing rate will be 200 basis points for the third quarter. The fee on the unused balance of the $100 million committed line of credit is 20 basis points. Under the terms of this line of credit, the Company has agreed to a negative pledge of real estate assets and is required to comply with financial covenants that limit the ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA and require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. As of  December 31, 2018, there was $48.4 million borrowed against the line of credit, and $51.6 million was available as of that date. Based on the terms of the line of credit and the maturity date, the debt has been classified as long term. 
The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants as of  December 31, 2018.  
The Company paid cash dividends of $2,587,000 and $2,564,000 in the six months ended  December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Dividends on restricted stock units in the amount of $34,631 and $38,463 were accrued as of  December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These dividends will be paid upon the vesting of the restricted stock units when shares are issued to the award recipients. In  January 2019, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable  February 12, 2019 to shareholders of record as of  February 4, 2019. The indicated annual cash dividend rate is $0.20 per share.  
The Company  may occasionally issue a standby letter of credit in favor of third parties. As of  December 31, 2018, there were no standby letter of credit agreements. 
The Company recorded severance expense of $492,000 and $83,000 in the six months ended  December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This severance expense was related to reductions in staffing not related to plant restructuring. See further discussion of restructuring expenses in Note 13. 
Of the total $1,715,000 severance reserve reported as of  December 31, 2018, $869,000 has been classified as a current liability and will be paid out over the next twelve months. The remaining $846,000 has been classified as a long-term liability. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, management approved the closure of its 12,000 square foot leased facility in Hawthorne, California. The facility was used as a warehouse and for light assembly of light fixtures. The Company has moved the light assembly to its Blue Ash, Ohio facility. The restructuring charges consist primarily of transportation costs to move inventory to Blue Ash, the impairment of equipment, costs to restore the leased facility, and severance benefits. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has incurred restructuring costs of $155,000 related to the closure of the Hawthorne facility. The Company also incurred $148,000 of expense to write-down inventory which is a re-valuation of the previous estimate and which is not included in the tables below. 
Additionally, the above tables do not include expense of $632,000 and $1,067,000 recorded during the three months ended and during the six months ended  December 31, 2018, respectively, related to the write-down of inventory included as cost of sales as part of facility closures. 
The above table does not include fixed asset impairment and accelerated depreciation expense of $228,000 recorded in the first six months of fiscal 2019. 
Refer to Note 12 for information regarding additional severance expenses that are not included in the restructuring costs identified in this footnote.
