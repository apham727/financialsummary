Summary Comments 
Fiscal 2019 third quarter net sales of $72,832,000 decreased $6.0 million or 8% as compared to third quarter fiscal 2018 net sales of $78,843,000. Net sales were favorably influenced by increased net sales of the Graphics Segment (up $2.8 million or 16%) more than offset by decreased net sales of the Lighting Segment (down $8.8 million or 14%). 
Fiscal 2019 first nine months net sales of $247,330,000 decreased $11.3 million or 4% as compared to first nine months fiscal 2018 net sales of $258,614,000. Net sales were favorably influenced by increased net sales of the Graphics Segment (up $10.0 million or 17%) more than offset by decreased net sales of the Lighting Segment (down $21.3 million or 11%). 
Fiscal 2019 third quarter operating loss of $(2,273,000) represents a $3.0 million change from operating income of $0.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The $3.0 million change from operating income in fiscal 2018 to an operating loss in fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of decreased net sales and decreased gross profit offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses. 
Fiscal 2019 first nine months operating loss of $(19,610,000) represents a $0.1 million increase in operating loss from an operating loss of $(19,524,000) in the nine months of fiscal 2018. Both fiscal years recorded goodwill impairment charges in the Lighting Segment. There was a $20.2 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2019 and a $28.0 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2018. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 of $3.2 million decreased $5.4 million from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $8.6 million. Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. The decrease in adjusted operating income was the result of decreased net sales and decreased gross profit offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses. Also contributing to the period-over-period results is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million. 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
The reconciliation of reported earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share may not produce identical amounts due to rounding differences and due to the difference between basic and dilutive weighted average shares outstanding in the computation of earnings per share.

Results of Operations 
Lighting Segment net sales of $52,785,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $8.8 million or 14% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $61,554,000. The 14% drop in sales is attributed to continued competitiveness in the Company’s project and stock and flow markets. The Company also elected not to run any quarter-end promotional programs in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to several promotional programs which were conducted at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, the Company’s realignment of its sales organization and focus on market priorities were disruptive and contributed to the decline in third quarter sales.  
Graphics Segment 
Graphics Segment net sales of $20,047,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $2.7 million or 16% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $17,289,000. Most of the increase in sales is from growth in sales to the petroleum market. 
Selling and administrative expenses of $3,916,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $0.4 million or 10% from the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of an increase in outside service expense and bad debt expense. 
The gross (loss) relates to the change in the intercompany profit in inventory elimination. 
The Company reported $579,000 net interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $400,000 net interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The change in interest expense from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is the result of higher interest rates on the Company’s line of credit. The Company also recorded other expense of $183,000 in the third quarter related to net foreign currency transaction losses from transactions with its customers and suppliers through its Mexican subsidiary. 
The $133,000 income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a pre-tax loss is the result of a cumulative change to the Company’s estimated annual tax rate. The Company has announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its New Windsor, New York facility. The closing of the sale is expected in the fourth quarter and is expected to generate a gain resulting from the sale. This gain will be offset by a capital loss carryforward resulting in a tax benefit. This event was part of the calculation of the estimated annual income tax rate. The $123,000 income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 represents a consolidated effective tax rate of 35.9%. This is the net result of adjusting the Company’s year-to-date tax expense to an overall income tax rate of 28.9% influenced by the first quarter goodwill impairment and by certain permanent book-tax differences and adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions. 
The Company reported a net loss of $(3,168,000) in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to net income of $220,000 in the same period of the prior year. The change from net income in fiscal 2018 to a net loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 is the net result of decreased net sales, decreased gross profit, decreased selling and administrative expenses, and increased interest expense. Also impacting the period-over-period comparison is $368,000 of restructuring charges and $183,000 of net foreign currency transactions losses of which there were no comparable events in fiscal 2018. Diluted loss per share of $(0.12) was reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to $ 0.01 diluted earnings per share in the same period of fiscal 2018. The weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 were 26,132,000 shares as compared to 26,437,000 shares in the same period last year. 
Graphics Segment net sales of $69,459,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased $10.0 million or 17% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $59,458,000. Most of the increase in sales is from growth in sales to the Petroleum and Quick Service Restaurant markets including digital technology. 
Selling and administrative expenses of $11,377,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased $0.4 million or 4% from the same period of fiscal 2018. A reduction in wage and benefit was more than offset by an increase in bad debt expense and outside service expense.  
The gross (loss) relates to the change in the intercompany profit in inventory elimination. 
The Company reported $1,712,000 net interest expense in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to $1,220,000 net interest expense in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The change in interest expense from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is the result of higher interest rates on the Company’s line of credit. The Company also recorded other expense of $183,000 in the third quarter related to net foreign currency transaction losses from transactions with its customers and suppliers through its Mexican subsidiary. 
The $4,304,000 income tax benefit in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 represents a consolidated effective tax rate of 20.0%, which is inclusive of a cumulative change to the estimated annual tax rate mostly due to the tax treatment related to the fourth quarter sale of its New Windsor, New York facility. The Company has announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its New Windsor, New York facility. The closing of the sale is expected in the fourth quarter and is expected to generate a gain resulting from the sale. This gain will be offset by a capital loss carryforward resulting in a tax benefit. Also impacting the consolidated tax benefit is the second quarter goodwill impairment charge and a 30% tax rate on taxable income from pre-tax profits recognized by the Company’s Mexican subsidiary. The $3,867,000 tax benefit in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 represents a consolidated effective rate of 18.6%. This is the net result of an overall income tax rate of 28.9% influenced by the first quarter goodwill impairment, by the second quarter $4.7 million tax adjustment related to the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets, and by certain permanent book-tax differences and adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions. 
The Company reported a net loss of $(17,201,000) in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to net loss of $(16,877,000) in the same period of the prior year. The increase in the net loss from fiscal 2018 to the net loss in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 is mostly driven by decreased net sales, decreased gross profit, decreased selling and administrative expenses, increased interest expense, and a larger tax benefit. Diluted loss per share of $(0.66) was reported in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 as compared to $(0.65) diluted loss per share in the same period of fiscal 2018. The weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 were 26,083,000 shares as compared to 25,835,000 shares in the same period last year. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources  
The Company considers its level of cash on hand, borrowing capacity, current ratio and working capital levels to be its most important measures of short-term liquidity. For long-term liquidity indicators, the Company believes its ratio of long-term debt to equity and its historical levels of net cash flows from operating activities to be the most important measures. 
At March 31, 2019 the Company had working capital of $68.3 million, compared to $67.9 million at June 30, 2018. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.59 to 1 as compared to a ratio of 2.61 to 1 at June 30, 2018. The $0.4 million increase in working capital from June 30, 2018 to March 31, 2019 was primarily related to the net effect of decreased cash and cash equivalents ($1.5 million), increased net accounts receivable ($1.5 million), increased net inventory ($0.6 million), a decrease in accrued expenses ($2.1 million), a decrease in refundable income taxes ($0.3 million), an increase on other current assets ($0.6 million), and an increase in accounts payable ($2.7 million). Of the $1.5 million increase in accounts receivable, $4.6 million of the total increase is attributed to the adoption of the new revenue guidance. The Company proactively manages its working capital, including reduction of the accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) and reduction of inventory levels, without reducing service to its customers. 
The Company generated $6.4 million of cash from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 as compared to a source of cash of $7.9 million in the same period of the prior year. This $1.5 million decrease in net cash flows from operating activities is primarily the net result of an increase rather than a decrease in accounts payable (favorable change of $5.8 million), a decrease rather than an increase in net accounts receivable (favorable change of $3.7 million), a greater increase in net inventory (unfavorable change of $4.0 million), a greater decrease in accrued expenses and other (unfavorable change of $1.3 million), and an increase in net loss from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 along with unfavorable change of non-cash add-backs to the change in net loss (unfavorable change of $6.1 million). 
Net accounts receivable were $52.1 million and $50.6 million at March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. DSO was 60 days at March 31, 2019 compared to DSO of 53 days at June 30, 2018. The Company believes that its receivables are ultimately collectible or recoverable, net of certain reserves, and that aggregate allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate. 
Net inventories of $51.6 million at March 31, 2019 increased $0.6 million from $51.0 million at June 30, 2018. The increase of $0.6 million is the result of an increase in gross inventory of $1.5 million and an increase in obsolescence reserves of $0.9 million. Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory increased $3.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 in the Graphics Segment which was partially offset by a decrease in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $3.0 million. 
Cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the Company’s line of credit is the Company’s primary source of liquidity. The Company has a secured $75 million revolving line of credit with its bank, with $30.6 million of the credit line available as of April 14, 2019. (The Company amended its revolving line of credit in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and reduced its available line of credit from $100 million to $75 million in order to better match its financing needs with an appropriate borrowing capacity.) This line of credit is a $75 million five-year credit line expiring in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company believes that its $75 million line of credit plus cash flows from operating activities are adequate for the Company’s fiscal 2019 operational and capital expenditure needs. The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants. 
The Company used cash of $2.3 million related to investing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 as compared to a use of $0.7 million in the same period of the prior year, resulting in an unfavorable change of $1.6 million. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased $0.1 million to $2.3 million from the same period in fiscal 2018. The Company sold its Woonsocket manufacturing facility for $1.5 million in fiscal 2018 which contributed to the change in cash flow from investing activities from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019. 
In April 2019, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its manufacturing facility in New Windsor, New York. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will receive approximately $12 million of gross proceeds related to the sale. The transaction is expected to close on or before June 30, 2019 subject to the final approval from the New Windsor town officials. 
The Company had a $5.5 million use of cash related to financing activities in the nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to a use of cash of $8.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. The $2.7 million favorable change in cash flow was primarily the net result of a reduction in net payments against the Company’s revolving line of credit. 
Cash Dividends 
In April 2019, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable May 14, 2019 to shareholders of record as of May 6, 2019. The indicated annual cash dividend rate for fiscal 2019 is $0.20 per share. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy regarding dividends which indicates that dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion based upon its evaluation of earnings, cash flow requirements, financial condition, debt levels, stock repurchases, future business developments and opportunities, and other factors deemed relevant.
