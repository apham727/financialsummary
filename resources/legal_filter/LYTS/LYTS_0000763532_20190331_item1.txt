A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company’s fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Significant changes to our accounting policies as a result of adopting ASU-2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606) are discussed below. 
Installation is a separate performance obligation, except for our digital signage products. For digital signage products, installation is not a separate performance obligation as the product and installation is the combined item promised in digital signage contracts. The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities other than standard warranties. 
Customer specific branded print graphics    
Digital signage and related media content    
The Company also offers installation services. Installation revenue is recognized over time as our customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided through the installation process. 
Disaggregation of Revenue 
The Company disaggregates the revenue from contracts with customers by the timing of revenue recognition because the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, and timing of our revenue and cash flows. The table presents a reconciliation of the disaggregation by reportable segments. 
Practical Expedients and Exemptions 
The Company’s contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, as such the Company applies the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred, and have omitted disclosures on the amount of remaining performance obligations.    
Shipping costs that are not material in context of the delivery of products are expensed as incurred.    
The Company’s accounts receivable balance represents the Company’s unconditional right to receive payment from its customers with contracts. Payments are generally due within 30 to 90 days of completion of the performance obligation and invoicing, therefore, payments do not contain significant financing components.    
On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09. “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective adoption method which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. This approach was applied to contracts that were not completed as of June 30, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period. The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $591,000 on July 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606, as described below. 
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company has an implementation team tasked with reviewing our lease obligations and determining the impact of the new standard to its financial statements. The Company will continue to evaluate the new standard’s impact to its financial statements.  
In April 2019, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its manufacturing facility in New Windsor, New York. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will receive approximately $12 million of gross proceeds related to the sale and expects to report a gain between $3 million to $5.5 million. The transaction is expected to close on or before June 30, 2019 subject to the final approval from the New Windsor town officials. 
There was no concentration of consolidated net sales in the three and nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. There was no concentration of accounts receivable at March 31, 2019 or June 30, 2018. 
The segment net sales reported above represent sales to external customers. Segment operating income, which is used in management’s evaluation of segment performance, represents net sales less all operating expenses. Identifiable assets are those assets used by each segment in its operations. 
The Company’s operations are located solely within North America. As a result, the geographic distribution of the Company’s net sales and long-lived assets originate within North America. 
    (a)   Includes shares accounted for like treasury stock.    
    (b)   Calculated using the “Treasury Stock” method as if dilutive securities were exercised and the funds were used to purchase common shares at the average market price during the period.    
    (c)   Options to purchase 3,787,519 common shares and 1,945,348 common shares for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were not included in the computation of the three month diluted loss per share because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares. Additionally, options to purchase 3,702,031 common shares and 3,086,121 common shares for the nine months ended at March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were not included in the computation of the nine month diluted loss per share because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market value of the common shares. For the three months ended in March 31, 2019 and the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the effect of dilutive securities was not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share because there was a net loss for the period.    
A sustained and significant decline in the Company’s stock price in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 led management to believe that a triggering event occurred and that an interim goodwill impairment test was required for one of the reporting units in the Lighting Segment that contains goodwill, as of December 31, 2018. In accordance with ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” which was adopted in a prior period, the requirement to perform step 2 in the impairment test was not required. The result of the impairment test on the reporting unit in the Lighting Segment indicated that goodwill was impaired by $20,165,000. The Company will continue to monitor market conditions and other events that may result in a sustained and significant drop in its stock price which would require an interim goodwill impairment test. 
As of March 1, 2019, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on the two reporting units that contain goodwill. The preliminary goodwill impairment test on one reporting unit in the Lighting Segment passed with a business enterprise value that was $38.9 million or 54% above the carrying value of this reporting unit including goodwill. The preliminary goodwill impairment test of the reporting unit with goodwill in the Graphics Segment passed with an estimated business enterprise value that was $3.0 million or 297% above the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill. The definitive impairment test is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. It is anticipated that the results of the test will not change when the test is complete. 
The Company performed its annual review of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of March 1, 2019 and determined there was no impairment. The preliminary indefinite-lived intangible impairment test passed with a fair market value that was $19.2 million or 462% above its carrying value. The definitive indefinite-lived impairment test is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. It is anticipated that the results of the test will not change when the test is complete. 
Amortization expense (in thousands) for intangible assets was $691 and $691 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $2,071 and $2,071 for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Future amortization expense (in thousands) associated with these intangible assets is expected to be $2,761 in 2019, $2,687 in 2020, $2,682 in 2021, $2,460 in 2022, $2,412 in 2023, and $18,985 after 2023. 
In February 2019, the Company amended its secured line of credit to a $75 million facility from a $100 million facility in order to better match its financing needs with an appropriate borrowing capacity. The line of credit expires in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Interest on the revolving line of credit is charged based upon an increment over the LIBOR rate as periodically determined, or at the bank’s base lending rate, at the Company’s option. The increment over the LIBOR borrowing rate, as periodically determined, fluctuates between 125 and 250 basis points depending upon the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), as defined in the line of credit agreement. The increment over LIBOR borrowing rate will be 200 basis points for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The fee on the unused balance of the $75 million committed line of credit is 20 basis points. Under the terms of this line of credit, the Company has agreed to a negative pledge of real estate assets and is required to comply with financial covenants that limit the ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA and require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. As of March 31, 2019, there was $43.8 million borrowed against the line of credit, and $31.2 million was available as of that date. Based on the terms of the line of credit and the maturity date, the debt has been classified as long term.  
The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants as of March 31, 2019. 
The Company paid cash dividends of $3,882,000 and $3,845,000 in the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Dividends on restricted stock units in the amount of $40,798 and $44,946 were accrued as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These dividends will be paid upon the vesting of the restricted stock units when shares are issued to the award recipients. In April 2019, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable May 14, 2019 to shareholders of record as of May 6, 2019. The indicated annual cash dividend rate is $0.20 per share. 
The Company may occasionally issue a standby letter of credit in favor of third parties. As of March 31, 2019, there were no standby letter of credit agreements. 
The Company recorded severance expense of $534,000 and $91,000 in the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This severance expense was related to reductions in staffing not related to plant restructuring. See further discussion of restructuring expenses in Note 13. 
Of the total $1,350,000 severance reserve reported as of March 31, 2019, $644,000 has been classified as a current liability and will be paid out over the next twelve months. The remaining $706,000 has been classified as a long-term liability. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, management approved the closure of its 12,000 square foot leased facility in Hawthorne, California. The facility was used as a warehouse and for light assembly of light fixtures. The Company has moved the light assembly to its Blue Ash, Ohio facility. The restructuring charges consist primarily of transportation costs to move inventory to Blue Ash, the impairment of equipment, costs to restore the leased facility, and severance benefits. As of March 31, 2019, the Company has incurred restructuring costs of $155,000 related to the closure of the Hawthorne facility. The Company also incurred $148,000 of expense to write-down inventory which is a re-valuation of the previous estimate and which is not included in the tables below. 
Additionally, the above tables do not include expense of $1,067,000 recorded during the nine months ended March 31, 2019 related to the write-down of inventory included as cost of sales as part of facility closures. 
The above table does not include fixed asset impairment and accelerated depreciation expense of $228,000 recorded in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. 
Refer to Note 12 for information regarding additional severance expenses that are not included in the restructuring costs identified in this footnote.  
In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, a deferred tax asset of $4.8 million was created as a result of the impairment of goodwill in the Lighting reporting unit. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, a deferred tax asset of $10.7 million was created as a result of the impairment of goodwill in the Lighting reporting unit.
