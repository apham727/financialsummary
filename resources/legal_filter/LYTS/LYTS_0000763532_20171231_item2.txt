Summary Comments 
Fiscal 2018 second quarter net sales of $92,305,000 increased $6.6 million or 7.8% as compared to second quarter fiscal 2017 net sales of $85,658,000. Net sales were favorably influenced by increased net sales of the Lighting Segment (up $4.1 million or 6.3%) and increased net sales of the Graphics Segment (up $2.5 million or 12.4%). Comparable fiscal 2018 net sales excluding net sales from Atlas Lighting Products, Inc. (“Atlas”) decreased by $7.3 million or 8.5% compared to fiscal 2017 net sales. The Company acquired Atlas on February 21, 2017.  
Fiscal 2018 first half net sales of $179,771,000 increased $10 million or 5.9% as compared to first half fiscal 2017 net sales of $169,817,000. Net sales were favorably influenced by increased net sales of the Lighting Segment (up $7.3 million or 5.5%) and increased net sales of the Graphics Segment (up $2.7 million or 6.8%). Comparable fiscal 2018 net sales excluding net sales from Atlas decreased by $15.0 million or 8.8% compared to fiscal 2017 net sales. 
Fiscal 2018 second quarter operating income of $4,547,000 increased $1.7 million or 61.4% from operating income of $2,818,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in adjusted operating income was the net result of increased net sales, increased gross profit and increased gross profit as a percentage of sales, and an increase in selling and administrative expenses. The Company also recorded restructuring costs of $697,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 with no corresponding cost in fiscal 2018.  
Fiscal 2018 first half operating loss of $(20,267,000) represents a $24.2 million change from operating income of $3,884,000 in the first half of fiscal 2017. The change from operating income in fiscal 2017 to an operating loss in fiscal 2018 is primarily the result of a $28 million goodwill impairment in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Also contributing to the year-over-year change in operating income is the net result of increased net sales, increased gross profit and increased gross profit as a percentage of sales, and an increase in selling and administrative expenses. The Company also recorded restructuring costs of $1,753,000 in the first half of fiscal 2017 with no corresponding cost in fiscal 2018.  
Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
The reconciliation of reported net income and earnings per share to adjusted net income and earnings per share may not agree due to rounding differences and due to the difference between basic and dilutive weighted average shares outstanding in the computation of earnings per share. 
Lighting Segment net sales of $69,174,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 6.3% from fiscal 2017 same period net sales of $65,076,000. Comparable fiscal 2018 net sales excluding net sales from Atlas decreased by $9.8 million or 15.1% from fiscal 2017 second quarter sales. The Lighting Segment’s net sales of light fixtures having solid-state LED technology totaled $57.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, representing an $11.6 million or 25.1% increase from fiscal 2017 second quarter net sales of solid-state LED light fixtures of $46.1 million. Light fixtures having solid-state LED technology represent 91.7% of total lighting product net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 78.2% of total lighting product net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Total lighting product net sales excludes sales related to installation and shipping and handling. There was a reduction in the Company’s traditional lighting sales (metal halide and fluorescent light sources) from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 as customers continue to convert from traditional lighting to light fixtures having solid-state LED technology.  
Lighting Segment total net sales of solid-state LED technology in light fixtures have been recorded as indicated in the table below.  
Selling and administrative expenses of $13,984,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1.3 million or 9.9% from the same period of fiscal 2017, primarily as the net result of acquiring Atlas. Our comparable selling and administrative expenses excluding Atlas decreased 16.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from the same period of fiscal 2017. The more notable quarter-over-quarter changes impacting the $1.3 million increase in selling and administrative expenses are increased employee compensation and benefits expense ($0.8 million), decreased commission expense ($1.1 million), and increased amortization expense ($0.6 million).  
The Lighting Segment second quarter fiscal 2018 operating income of $5,275,000 increased $1.5 million or 40.3% from operating income of $3,761,000 in the same period of fiscal 2017. The $1.5 million increase in operating income was the net result of increased net sales, an increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales, increased selling and administrative expenses, and plant closure costs in fiscal 2017 with no comparable expenses in fiscal 2018.  
Graphics Segment net sales of $23,131,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $2.5 million or 12.4% from fiscal 2017 same period net sales of $20,582,000. Sales to the Retail and QSR markets increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared the second quarter of fiscal 2017, followed by a modest increase in sales to the Petroleum market.  
Gross profit of $6,046,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $1.1 million or 23.0% from the same period of fiscal 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of segment net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales) increased from 23.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to 25.0% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The change in amount of gross profit is due to the net effect of increased net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales), improved gross profit margin on shipping and handling sales, and decreased employee compensation and benefit expense ($0.1 million). The Company incurred $211,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 related to the closure of its Woonsocket, Rhode Island facility with no comparable expense in fiscal 2018.  
Corporate and Eliminations 
The gross profit (loss) relates to the change in the intercompany profit in inventory elimination. 
The Company reported $417,000 net interest expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to net interest income of $20,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The change from interest income in fiscal 2017 to interest expense in fiscal 2018 is the result of borrowing against the Company’s line of credit. Commitment fees related to the unused portion of the Company’s line of credit and interest income on invested cash are included in both fiscal years.  
The Company reported a net loss of $(1,468,000) in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to net income of $2,006,000 in the same period of the prior year. The change between net income in fiscal 2017 to a net loss in fiscal 2018 is mostly driven by the $4.7 million charge in fiscal 2018 related to the re-valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets. Also contributing to the quarter-over-quarter net change in net income are increased net sales, increased gross profit and an improvement of gross profit as a percentage of sales, increased selling and administrative expenses, and restructuring and plant closure costs in fiscal 2017 with no comparable costs in fiscal 2018. Diluted loss per share of $(0.06) was reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to $0.08 diluted earnings per share in the same period of fiscal 2017. The weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were 25,858,000 shares as compared to 25,803,000 shares in the same period last year. 
 Lighting Segment net sales of $137,602,000 in the first half of fiscal 2018 increased 5.5% from fiscal 2017 same period net sales of $130,341,000. Comparable fiscal 2018 net sales excluding net sales from Atlas decreased by $17.7 million or 13.6% from fiscal 2017 second quarter sales. The Lighting Segment’s net sales of light fixtures having solid-state LED technology totaled $110.7 million in the first half of fiscal 2018, representing a $21.4 million or 24.0% increase from fiscal 2017 first half net sales of solid-state LED light fixtures of $89.3 million. Light fixtures having solid-state LED technology represent 88.3% of total lighting product net sales in the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to 75.2% of total lighting product net sales in the first half of fiscal 2017. Total lighting product net sales excludes sales related to installation and shipping and handling. There was a reduction in the Company’s traditional lighting sales (metal halide and fluorescent light sources) from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 as customers continue to convert from traditional lighting to light fixtures having solid-state LED technology.  
Selling and administrative expenses of $27,587,000 in the first half of fiscal 2018 excluding the $28 million goodwill impairment charge, increased $2.1 million or 8.1% from the same period of fiscal 2017 primarily as the net result of acquiring Atlas. Our comparable selling and administrative expenses excluding Atlas decreased 17.5% in the first half of fiscal 2018 from the same period of fiscal 2017. The more notable year-over-year changes impacting the $2.1 million increase in selling and administrative expenses are increased employee compensation and benefits expense ($1.3 million), increased research and development expense ($0.2 million), decreased commission expense ($1.6 million), and increased amortization expense ($1.2 million). The Company recorded a $28 million goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2018 with no comparable expense in fiscal 2017. The Company will perform an impairment analysis in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 in conjunction with its annual impairment test.  
Graphics Segment net sales of $42,169,000 in the first half of fiscal 2018 increased $2.7 million or 6.8% from fiscal 2017 same period net sales of $39,476,000. Sales to the Retail and QSR markets increased in the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 which more than offset a decline in sales to the Petroleum market over the same period.  
Gross profit of $11,109,000 in the first half of fiscal 2018 increased $1.8 million or 18.7% from the same period of fiscal 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of segment net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales) increased from 23.2% in the first half of fiscal 2017 to 25.7% in the first half of fiscal 2018. The change in amount of gross profit is due to the net effect of increased net sales (customer plus inter-segment net sales), an improvement in the gross profit margin of installation and shipping and handling sales, and decreased employee compensation and benefit expense ($0.5 million). The Company incurred $211,000 in the first half of fiscal 2017 related to the closure of its Woonsocket, Rhode Island facility with no comparable expense in fiscal 2018.  
The Graphics Segment first half fiscal 2018 operating income of $3,731,000 increased $1.5 million or 70.3% from operating income of $2,191,000 in the same period of fiscal 2017. The increase of $1.5 million was primarily the net result of increased net sales, increased gross profit and increased gross profit margin as a percentage of sales, and a small increase in selling and administrative costs. 
The gross profit (loss) relates to the change in the intercompany profit in inventory elimination. 
Administrative expenses of $6,312,000 in the first half of fiscal 2018 increased $0.7 million or 11.5% from the same period of the prior year. The $0.7 million increase is the result of increased employee compensation and benefit expense ($0.5 million increase) and by a net increase in other cost categories. Most of the increase in employee compensation and benefit expense is the result of the reduction of incentive-based compensation in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 which is driven by the operating results of the Company. There was no similar reduction in incentive-based compensation in fiscal 2018. Also contributing to the net change in administrative expenses are restructuring costs of $0.1 million recorded in fiscal 2017 related to the consolidation of its Beaverton, Oregon facility into other LSI facilities, with no comparable costs in fiscal 2018.  
The Company reported $820,000 net interest expense in the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to net interest income of $34,000 in the first half of fiscal 2017. The change from interest income in fiscal 2017 to interest expense in fiscal 2018 is the result of borrowing against the Company’s line of credit. Commitment fees related to the unused portion of the Company’s line of credit and interest income on invested cash are included in both fiscal years.  
The Company reported a net loss of $(17,097,000) in the first half of fiscal 2018 as compared to net income of $2,835,000 in the same period of the prior year. The change between net income in fiscal 2017 to a net loss in fiscal 2018 is mostly driven by the $4.7 million charge in fiscal 2018 related to the re-valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and by the first quarter goodwill impairment. Also contributing to the quarter-over-quarter net change in net income are increased net sales, increased gross profit and an improvement of gross profit as a percentage of sales, increased selling and administrative expenses, and restructuring and plant closure costs in fiscal 2017 with no comparable costs in fiscal 2018. Diluted loss per share of $(0.66) was reported in the first half of fiscal 2018 as compared to $0.11 diluted earnings per share in the same period of fiscal 2017. The weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share in the first half of fiscal 2018 were 25,824,000 shares as compared to 25,859,000 shares in the same period last year. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources  
The Company considers its level of cash on hand, borrowing capacity, current ratio and working capital levels to be its most important measures of short-term liquidity. For long-term liquidity indicators, the Company believes its ratio of long-term debt to equity and its historical levels of net cash flows from operating activities to be the most important measures. 
The Company used $0.8 million of cash from operating activities in the first half of fiscal 2018 as compared to a source of cash of $4.6 million in the same period of the prior year. This $5.4 million decrease in net cash flows from operating activities is primarily the net result of a larger increase in accounts receivable (unfavorable change of $8.2 million), a larger decrease in accounts payable (unfavorable change of $2.4 million), a decrease rather than an increase in customer prepayments (unfavorable change of $0.4 million), a smaller decrease in net inventory (unfavorable change of $0.7 million), a smaller decrease in accrued expenses and other (favorable change of $1.9 million), a decrease in refundable income taxes (favorable change of $0.8 million), and a change from net income in fiscal 2017 to a net loss in fiscal 2018 more than offset by an increase in non-cash items (favorable change of $3.7 million).  
Net accounts receivable were $59.7 million and $48.9 million at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively. DSO increased to 56 days at December 31, 2017 from 52 days at June 30, 2017. The Company believes that its receivables are ultimately collectible or recoverable, net of certain reserves, and that aggregate allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate.  
Net inventories of $48.7 million at December 31, 2017 decreased $1.4 million from $50.0 million at June 30, 2017. The decrease of $1.4 million is the result of a decrease in gross inventory of $1.0 million and an increase in obsolescence reserves of $0.4 million. Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory increases occurred in the first half of fiscal 2018 in the Graphics Segment of approximately $0.9 million which was more than offset by a decrease in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $2.2 million.  
Cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the Company’s line of credit is the Company’s primary source of liquidity. The Company has a secured $100 million revolving line of credit with its bank, with $56.8 million of the credit line available as of January 25, 2018. This line of credit is a $100 million five year credit line expiring in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company believes that its $100 million line of credit plus cash flows from operating activities are adequate for the Company’s fiscal 2018 operational and capital expenditure needs. The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants.  
The Company generated cash of $0.3 million related to investing activities in the half of fiscal 2018 as compared to a use of $2.7 million in the same period from the prior year, resulting in a favorable change of $3.1 million. Capital expenditures for the first half of fiscal 2018 decreased $1.6 million to $1.2 million from the same period in fiscal 2017. The Company sold its Woonsocket manufacturing facility for $1.5 million which contributed to the change in cash flow from investing activities from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018.  
The Company generated $0.6 million of cash related to financing activities in the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to a use of cash of $2.7 million in the first half of fiscal 2017. The $3.3 million favorable change in cash flow was the net result of borrowings in excess of payments of long term debt of $2.5 million, and a decrease in the purchase of treasury shares coupled with an increase in the distribution of treasury shares (favorable change of $0.7 million).  
The Company has no financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk and has no off-balance sheet arrangements, except for various operating leases. 
Cash Dividends 
In January 2018, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable February 13, 2018 to shareholders of record as of February 5, 2018. The indicated annual cash dividend rate for fiscal 2018 is $0.20 per share. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy regarding dividends which indicates that dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion based upon its evaluation of earnings, cash flow requirements, financial condition, debt levels, stock repurchases, future business developments and opportunities, and other factors deemed relevant.  
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
Revenue Recognition 
Product revenue is recognized on product-only orders upon passing of title and risk of loss, generally at time of shipment. In certain arrangements with customers, as is the case with the sale of some of our solid-state LED video screens, revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance of the video screen at the job site. Product revenue related to orders where the customer requires the Company to install the product is recognized when the product is installed. The company provides product warranties and certain post-shipment service, support and maintenance of certain solid-state LED video screens and billboards. 
Installation revenue is recognized when the products have been fully installed. The Company is not always responsible for installation of products it sells and has no post-installation responsibilities, other than normal warranties. 
Service revenue from integrated design, project and construction management, and site permitting is recognized when all products at a customer site have been installed. 
Revenue from the management of media content and digital hardware related to active digital signage is recognized evenly over the service period with the customer. Media content service periods with most customers range from 1 month to 1 year. 
Shipping and handling revenue coincides with the recognition of revenue from the sale of the product. 
In situations where the Company is responsible for re-imaging programs with multiple sites, each site is viewed as a separate unit of accounting and has stand-alone value to the customer. Revenue is recognized upon the Company’s complete performance at the location, which may include a site survey, graphics products, lighting products, and installation of products. The selling price assigned to each site is based upon an agreed upon price between the Company and its customer and reflects the estimated selling price for that site relative to the selling price for sites with similar image requirements. 
The Company also evaluates the appropriateness of revenue recognition in accordance with the accounting standard on software revenue recognition. Our solid-state LED video screens, billboards and active digital signage contain software elements which the Company has determined are incidental. 
Asset Impairment 
Carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill and intangible assets. The Company may first assess qualitative factors in order to determine if goodwill is impaired. If through the qualitative assessment it is determined that it is more likely than not that goodwill is not impaired, no further testing is required. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, or if the Company elects not to first assess qualitative factors, the Company’s impairment testing continues at the reporting unit level with the estimation of the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets using a combination of a market approach and an income (discounted cash flow) approach. The estimation of the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. The estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could increase or decrease an impairment charge. Company management uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment tests. Indicators such as adverse business conditions, a sustained drop in the Company’s stock price, economic factors and technological change or competitive activities may signal that an asset has become impaired.  
  Carrying values for long-lived tangible assets and definite-lived intangible assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant. Impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of Company management when it believes that a change in circumstances in the business or external factors warrants a review. Circumstances such as the discontinuation of a product or product line, a sudden or consistent decline in the forecast for a product, changes in technology or in the way an asset is being used, a history of negative operating cash flow, or an adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others, may trigger an impairment review. The Company’s initial impairment review to determine if a potential impairment charge is required is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. The analysis requires judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, and discount rates. 
The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for probable estimated losses resulting from either customer disputes or the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make the required payments, the Company may be required to record additional allowances or charges against income. The Company determines its allowance for doubtful accounts by first considering all known collectability problems of customers’ accounts, and then applying certain percentages against the various aging categories based on the due date of the remaining receivables. The resulting allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is an estimate based upon the Company’s knowledge of its business and customer base, and historical trends. The amount ultimately not collected may differ from the reserve established, particularly in the case where percentages are applied against aging categories. In all cases, it is management’s goal to carry a reserve against the Company’s accounts receivable which is adequate based upon the information available at that time so that net accounts receivable is properly stated. The Company also establishes allowances, at the time revenue is recognized, for returns and allowances, discounts, pricing and other possible customer deductions. These allowances are based upon contractual terms and historical trends. 
 Warranty Reserves 
 Inventory Reserves 
The Company maintains an inventory reserve for probable obsolete and excess inventory. The Company first determines its obsolete inventory reserve by considering specific known obsolete items, and then by applying certain percentages to specific inventory categories based upon inventory turns. The Company uses various tools, in addition to inventory turns, to identify which inventory items have the potential to become obsolete. A combination of financial modeling and qualitative input factors are used to establish excess and obsolete inventory reserves and management adjusts these reserves as more information becomes available about the ultimate disposition of the inventory item. Management values inventory at lower of cost or market. 
New Accounting Pronouncements 
In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.” The amended guidance requires an entity to measure in scope inventory at lower of cost and net realizable value. The amended guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, or the Company’s fiscal 2018. We adopted the new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and there was no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” The amended guidance requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities that arise from leases. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, or the Company’s fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company has not yet determined the impact the amended guidance will have on its financial statements.  
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-08, “Principal versus Agent Considerations.” The amendment is intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, or the Company’s fiscal 2019, with early adoption permitted in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company has determined the amended guidance will have an immaterial impact on its financial statements. 
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” This amended guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, or the Company’s fiscal 2018. We adopted this standard on July 1, 2017 and recognized excess tax benefits of $81,010 in income tax expense during the three months ended September 30, 2017. The amount may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized as any excess tax benefits recognized would be dependent on future stock price, employee exercise behavior and applicable tax rates. Prior to July 1, 2017, excess tax benefits were recognized in additional paid-in capital. Additionally, excess tax benefits are now included in net cash flows provided by operating activities rather than net cash flows provided by financing activities in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The treatment of forfeitures has not changed, as the Company is electing to continue the current process of estimating forfeiture at the time of grant. The Company had no unrecognized excess tax benefits from prior periods to record upon the adoption of this ASU.  
  (1)   In the first half of fiscal 2018, all 575,000 shares authorized for the Company’s Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan have been extinguished by purchase in the open market. Newly issued shares from the Company’s 2012 Stock Incentive Plan will replace shares purchased in the open market to fulfill the obligation the plan has to its participants.
