Summary Comments 
Fiscal 2019 first quarter operating income of $2.9 million increased $27.7 million from an operating loss of $(24,814,000) in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The $27.7 million change from an operating loss in fiscal 2018 to operating income in fiscal 2019 was mostly the result of a pre-tax $28 million goodwill impairment charge in the Lighting Segment in fiscal 2018. Adjusted fiscal 2019 operating income of $3.5 million (which reflects the removal of plant closure costs) increased 10.6% from adjusted fiscal 2018 operating income of $3.2 (which reflects the removal of the goodwill impairment). Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. The increase in adjusted operating income was the result of decreased net sales and decreased gross profit more than offset by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses. Also contributing to the period-over-period results is a one-time adjustment to the Company’s paid-time-off policy in fiscal 2019 which resulted in a favorable pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1.2 million. 
On October 29, 2018, The Company announced that it will permanently close its New Windsor, New York manufacturing facility. The facility manufactures indoor lighting products and is included in the results of the Lighting Segment. Production will be transferred to the Company’s Erlanger, Kentucky and Blue Ash, Ohio facilities, also included in the Lighting Segment. The New Windsor facility has a workforce of 140 employees. The closure is part of ongoing actions to align the Company’s supply chain to more cost effectively serve the changing requirements of the lighting market. The closure will also allow the Company to improve utilization of existing manufacturing capacity. The transfer of production is expected to be completed by June 30, 2019. 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
Lighting Segment net sales of $61,432,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 10.2% from fiscal 2018 same period net sales of $68,428,000. The Lighting Segment’s net sales of light fixtures having solid-state LED technology totaled $49.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 which represent 91% of total lighting product net sales. There continues to be a reduction in the Company’s traditional lighting sales (metal halide and fluorescent light sources) as customers convert from traditional lighting to light fixtures having solid-state LED technology.  
Selling and administrative expenses of $3,395,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $0.2 million or 5.4% from the same period of fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of decreased wage and benefit expense. 
The gross profit or loss relates to the elimination of intercompany profit in inventory. 
Administrative expenses of $3,307,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased slightly from the same period of the prior year. The change is primarily the result of a decrease in employee compensation and benefit expense ($0.6 million) offset by an equal an increase in outside service expense ($0.4 million), and a net increase in various other expense categories ($0.2 million). 
The Company reported $518,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $403,000 net interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The change from interest expense from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 is the result of higher interest rates on the Company’s line of credit and higher commitment fees on its unused portion of the line of credit. 
The Company reported a net income of $1,749,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a net loss of $(15,629,000) in the same period of the prior year. The change between a net loss in fiscal 2018 to net income in fiscal 2019 is mostly driven by the $28 million pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2018 with no comparable event in fiscal 2019. When the impact of the fiscal 2018 goodwill impairment charge and the fiscal 2019 restructuring and plant costs are removed from the reported results, the fiscal 2019 adjusted net income of $2,203,000 increased $0.5 million or 27% from fiscal 2018 adjusted net income of $1,734,000. The change in adjusted net income is primarily the net result of decreased net sales, decreased gross profit, decreased selling and administrative expenses, increased interest expense, and a lower tax rate. Diluted earnings per share of $0.07 was reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to $(0.61) diluted loss per share in the same period of fiscal 2018. The weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were 26,365,000 shares as compared to 25,791,000 shares in the same period last year. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources  
The Company considers its level of cash on hand, borrowing capacity, current ratio and working capital levels to be its most important measures of short-term liquidity. For long-term liquidity indicators, the Company believes its ratio of long-term debt to equity and its historical levels of net cash flows from operating activities to be the most important measures. 
At September 30, 2018, the Company had working capital of $72.6 million, compared to $67.9 million at June 30, 2018. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.59 to 1 as compared to a ratio of 2.61 to 1 at June 30, 2018. The $4.7 million increase in working capital from June 30, 2018 to September 30, 2018 was primarily related to the net effect of increased cash and cash equivalents ($1.0 million), increased net accounts receivable ($9.2 million), decreased net inventory ($1.4 million), an increase in accrued expenses ($2.3 million), a decrease in refundable income taxes ($0.6 million), and an increase in accounts payable ($5.8 million). The $4.1 million of the increase in accounts receivable is the result of the adoption of the new revenue guidance. The Company has a strategy of aggressively managing working capital, including reduction of the accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) and reduction of inventory levels, without reducing service to its customers. 
The Company generated $2.2 million of cash from operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to a use of cash of $2.7 million in the same period of the prior year. This $4.9 million increase in net cash flows from operating activities is primarily the net result of an increase rather than a decrease in accounts payable (favorable change of $7.3 million), a smaller increase in net accounts receivable (favorable change of $1.2 million), an increase rather than a decrease in net inventory (unfavorable change of $4.2 million), a smaller decrease in refundable income taxes (favorable change of $0.2 million), an increase in customer prepayments (favorable change of $0.4 million), and an increase in net income in fiscal 2019 from a net loss in fiscal 2018 offset by several non-cash add-backs (favorable change of $0.4 million). 
Net accounts receivable were $59.8 million and $50.6 million at September 30, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively. DSO increased to 59 days at September 30, 2018 from 53 days at June 30, 2018. The Company believes that its receivables are ultimately collectible or recoverable, net of certain reserves, and that aggregate allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate. 
Net inventories of $49.6 million at September 30, 2018 decreased $1.4 million from $51.0 million at June 30, 2018. The decrease of $1.4 million is the result of a decrease in gross inventory of $0.9 million and an increase in obsolescence reserves of $0.5 million. Based on a strategy of balancing inventory reductions with customer service and the timing of shipments, net inventory increased 1.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in the Graphics Segment which was more than offset by a decrease in net inventory in the Lighting Segment of $3.2 million. 
Cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the Company’s line of credit is the Company’s primary source of liquidity. The Company has a secured $100 million revolving line of credit with its bank, with $46.1 million of the credit line available as of October 29, 2018. This line of credit is a $100 million five year credit line expiring in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company believes that its $100 million line of credit plus cash flows from operating activities are adequate for the Company’s fiscal 2019 operational and capital expenditure needs. The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants. 
The Company used cash of $0.7 million related to investing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to a source of $1.0 million in the same period of the prior year, resulting in an unfavorable change of $1.7 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $0.2 million to $0.6 million from the same period in fiscal 2018. The Company sold its Woonsocket manufacturing facility for $1.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 which contributed to the change in cash flow from investing activities from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019. 
The Company used $0.6 million of cash related to financing activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to a source of cash of $0.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The $1.3 million unfavorable change in cash flow was the net result of borrowings in excess of payments of long term debt of $1.4 million.
