(1) General 



The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Comtech Telecommunications Corp. and its subsidiaries ("Comtech," "we," "us," or "our") as of and for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 are unaudited.
In the opinion of management, the information furnished reflects all material adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the unaudited interim periods.
Certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported condensed consolidated financial statements to conform to the current fiscal period presentation.
(2) Acquisitions



Solacom Technologies Inc.



On February 28, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Solacom Technologies Inc. ("Solacom"), pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement, dated as of January 7, 2019, by and among Solacom, Comtech and Solar Acquisition Corp., a Canadian corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Comtech.
Solacom is a leading provider of Next Generation 911 ("NG-911") solutions for public safety agencies.
The acquisition of Solacom was a significant step in our strategy of enhancing our safety and security solutions.
The acquisition has a preliminary purchase price for accounting purposes of $32,934,000, of which $27,328,000 was settled in cash and $5,606,000 was settled with the issuance of 208,669 shares of Comtech’s common stock at a volume weighted average stock price of $26.86.
The fair value of consideration transferred in connection with this acquisition was $31,489,000, which was net of $1,445,000 of cash acquired.
The cash portion of the purchase price was funded principally through borrowings under our Credit Facility.
The preliminary purchase price for accounting purposes is subject to finalization.
We are accounting for the acquisition of Solacom under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC 805, "Business Combinations."
The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their preliminary fair value as of February 28, 2019, pursuant to the business combination accounting rules.
Acquisition plan expenses were not included as a component of consideration transferred and were expensed in the period incurred.
Our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2019 include a nominal contribution from Solacom.
Pro forma financial information is not disclosed, as the acquisition is not material.

The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the Solacom acquisition:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized over their estimated useful lives.
The preliminary fair value of customer relationships and backlog was primarily based on the value of the discounted cash flows that the related intangible asset could be expected to generate in the future.
The preliminary fair value of technology and trade name was based on the discounted capitalization of royalty expense saved because we now own the assets.
Among the factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill, as a component of the purchase price allocation, were synergies in products and technologies and the addition of a skilled, assembled workforce.
This goodwill has been assigned to our Commercial Solutions segment based on specific identification and is generally not deductible for income tax purposes.
The allocation of the preliminary purchase price shown in the above table was based upon a preliminary valuation and estimates and assumptions that are subject to change within the purchase price allocation period (generally one year from the acquisition date).
The primary areas of the purchase price allocation not yet finalized include the purchase price (due to customary provisions in the purchase agreement related to adjustments to net working capital as of the acquisition date), a final assessment of accrued warranty obligations, income taxes and residual goodwill.
GD NG-911 Business



On April 29, 2019, we completed the acquisition of a state and local government NG-911 business, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 29, 2019, by and among General Dynamics Information Technology, Inc., Comtech and Comtech NextGen LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Comtech.
The acquisition of this NG-911 business from GD ("the GD NG-911 business") has a preliminary cash purchase price of $10,000,000.
In connection with this acquisition, we also announced an award of a five-year contract to develop, implement and operate a NG-911 emergency communications system for a Northeastern State.
Immediately after our announcement of this acquisition, we hired approximately sixty GD NG-911 employees and commenced the integration of this business into our Commercial Solutions segment’s safety and security technology solutions product line.
The acquisition, contract award and hiring of talented employees are expected to strengthen Comtech’s position in the growing NG-911 solutions market.

We are accounting for the acquisition of this business under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC 805.
The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their preliminary fair value as of April 29, 2019, pursuant to the business combination accounting rules.
Acquisition plan expenses were not included as a component of consideration transferred and were expensed in the period incurred.
Our condensed consolidated financial results for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2019 included only 2 days of contribution from the GD NG-911 business.
Pro forma financial information is not disclosed, as the acquisition is not material.
The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of the GD NG-911 business:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which we believe approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized over their estimated useful lives.
The preliminary fair value of customer relationships and contracts was based on the value of the discounted cash flows that the related intangible asset could be expected to generate in the future.
The preliminary fair value of technology and know-how was based on the discounted capitalization of royalty expense saved because we now own the assets.
The preliminary fair value of other liabilities was based on the difference in discounted cash flows related to remaining performance obligations under a certain acquired contract as compared to current market terms for similar arrangements that a market participant would expect.
Other liabilities will be credited against cost of sales over the remaining performance of the contract, which is 5.25 years.
Among the factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill, as a component of the purchase price allocation, were synergies in solution offerings and the addition of a skilled, assembled workforce.
We currently estimate that approximately $6,300,000 of goodwill resulting from the acquisition will be tax deductible.
This goodwill has been assigned to our Commercial Solutions segment based on specific identification.
The allocation of the preliminary purchase price shown in the above table was based on a preliminary valuation and estimates and assumptions that are subject to change within the purchase price allocation period (generally one year from the acquisition date).
The primary areas of the purchase price allocation not yet finalized include the purchase price (due to customary provisions in the asset purchase agreement related to adjustments to net working capital as of the acquisition date), the estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired, intangible liability assumed, a final assessment of accrued warranty obligations, income taxes and residual goodwill.

(3) Adoption of Accounting Standards and Updates



We are required to prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") which is the source for all authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which are commonly referred to as "GAAP."
The FASB ASC is subject to updates by the FASB, which are known as Accounting Standards Updates ("ASUs").
During the nine months ended April 30, 2019, we adopted:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



•FASB ASU No.
2016-16 "Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory," which eliminates a prior exception and now requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory (for example, intellectual property and property, plant and equipment) when the transfer occurs.
We adopted this ASU on August 1, 2018.
There was no material impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements (including any cumulative-effect adjustment) and disclosures upon such adoption.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2019, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No.
33-10532 "Disclosure Update and Simplification," which revised certain of the SEC’s disclosure requirements that have become superseded in light of other SEC and or U.S. GAAP disclosure requirements.
As a result of the final rule’s amendments, the SEC now requires a registrant to reconcile its changes in stockholders' equity for both the current and comparative interim and year-to-date periods, with subtotals.
Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 reflect our adoption of this final rule.
(4) Revenue



On August 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No.
2014-09 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" or "ASC 606" applying the modified retrospective transition method.
As a practical expedient, we adopted the new standard only for existing contracts as of August 1, 2018.
All periods prior to August 1, 2018 will continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect in those periods.
(2) Formerly presented on the face of our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as "Customer advances and deposits, current and non-current" prior to our adoption of ASC 606.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)



(Unaudited)



The core principle of ASC 606 is that revenue should be recorded in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for goods or services promised to customers.
Under ASC 606, we follow a five-step model to: (1) identify the contract with our customer; (2) identify our performance obligations in our contract; (3) determine the transaction price for our contract; (4) allocate the transaction price to our performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue using one of the following two methods: 



•Over time - We recognize revenue using the over time method when there is a continuous transfer of control to the customer over the contractual period of performance.
This generally occurs when we enter into a long-term contract relating to the design, development or manufacture of complex equipment or technology platforms to a buyer’s specification (or to provide services related to the performance of such contracts).
Continuous transfer of control is typically supported by contract clauses which allow our customers to unilaterally terminate a contract for convenience, pay for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of work-in-process.
Revenue recognized over time is generally based on the extent of progress toward completion of the related performance obligations.
The selection of the method to measure progress requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services provided.
In certain instances, typically for firm fixed-price contracts, we use the cost-to-cost measure because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts.
Under the cost-to-cost measure, the extent of progress toward completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion, including warranty costs.
When these contracts are modified, the additional goods or services are generally not distinct from those already provided.
For over time contracts using a cost-to-cost measure of progress, we have an estimate at completion ("EAC") process in which management reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations.
Since certain contracts extend over a long period of time, the impact of revisions in revenue and or cost estimates during the progress of work may impact current period earnings through a cumulative adjustment.
Additionally, if the EAC process indicates a loss, a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident.
Contract revenue and cost estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed at least quarterly.
The cost-to-cost method is principally used to account for contracts in our command and control solutions and over-the-horizon microwave systems product lines and, to a lesser extent, certain location-based and messaging infrastructure contracts in our enterprise technology solutions product line.
For service-based contracts in both our enterprise technology solutions and safety and security technology solutions product lines, we recognize revenue over time.
These services are typically recognized as a series of services performed over the contract term using the straight-line method, or based on our customers’ actual usage of the networks and platforms which we provide.

Point in time accounting is principally applied to contracts in our satellite earth station product line (which includes satellite modems, traveling wave tube amplifiers ("TWTAs") and solid-state power amplifiers ("SSPAs")) and solid-state high-power narrow and broadband amplifiers.
Point in time accounting is also applied to certain contracts in our command and control solutions product line.
); and, although many of our contracts have termination for convenience clauses and or an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, our performance creates an asset with an alternative use through the point of delivery.
Finished products are either configured to our standard configuration or based on our customers’ specifications.
When identifying performance obligations, we consider whether there are multiple promises and how to account for them.
In our contracts, multiple promises are separated if they are distinct, both individually and in the context of the contract.
If multiple promises in a contract are highly interrelated or comprise a series of distinct services performed over time, they are combined into a single performance obligation.
In some cases, we may also provide the customer with an additional service-type warranty, which we recognize as a separate performance obligation.
When service-type warranties represent a separate performance obligation, the revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the extended warranty period.
Our contracts, from time-to-time, may also include options for additional goods and services.
To-date, these options have not represented material rights to the customer as the pricing for them reflects standalone selling prices.
As a result, we do not consider options we offer to be performance obligations for which we must allocate a portion of the transaction price.
In many cases, we provide assurance-type warranty coverage for some of our products for a period of at least one year from the date of delivery.
When identifying the transaction price, we typically utilize the contract's stated price as a starting point.
The transaction price in certain arrangements may include estimated amounts of variable consideration, including award fees, incentive fees or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price.
When allocating the contract’s transaction price, we consider each distinct performance obligation.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.
We determine standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately.

Almost all of our contracts with customers are denominated in U.S. dollars and typically are either firm fixed-price or cost reimbursable type contracts (including fixed-fee, incentive-fee and time-and-material type contracts).
In almost all of our contracts with customers, we are the principal in the arrangement and report revenue on a gross basis.
Domestic sales include sales to commercial customers, as well as to U.S. state and local governments.
Included in domestic sales, are sales to Verizon Communications Inc. ("Verizon").
Sales to Verizon were 9.2% and 9.5%, respectively, of consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2019.
Sales to Verizon were 9.8% and 10.6%, respectively, of consolidated net sales for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018. International sales include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers.
Under typical payment terms for our contracts accounted for over time, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones.
Under ASC 606, unbilled receivables constitute contract assets.
There were no material impairment losses recognized on contract assets during the nine months ended April 30, 2019.
On large long term contracts, and for contracts with international customers that do not do business with us regularly, payment terms typically require advanced payments and deposits.
Under ASC 606, payments received from customers in excess of revenue recognized to-date results in a contract liability.
These contract liabilities are not considered to represent a significant financing component of the contract because we believe these cash advances and deposits are generally used to meet working capital demands which can be higher in the earlier stages of a contract.
Also, advanced payments and deposits provide us with some measure of assurance that the customer will perform on its obligations under the contract.
Under the typical payment terms for our contracts accounted for at a point in time, costs are accumulated in inventory until the time of billing, which generally coincides with revenue recognition.
Contract liabilities increased $5,411,000 due to business combinations discussed in Note (2) - "Acquisitions".
Of the total contract liabilities at August 1, 2018, $30,061,000 was recognized as revenue during the nine months ended April 30, 2019.
We recognize the incremental costs to obtain or fulfill a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset is one year or less.
Incremental costs to obtain or fulfill contracts with an amortization period greater than one year were not material.
As for commissions payable to third party sales representatives related to large long-term contracts, we do consider these types of commissions both direct and incremental costs to obtain and fulfill such contracts.
Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of firm orders for which work has not been performed as of the end of a fiscal period.
Remaining performance obligations, which we refer to as backlog, exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity ("IDIQ") contracts.
As of April 30, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $747,130,000 (which represents the amount of our consolidated backlog).
During the three and nine months ended April 30, 2019, revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied, or partially satisfied, in previous periods (for example due to changes in the transaction price) was not material.
(5) Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments



Using the fair value hierarchy described in FASB ASC 820 "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," we valued our cash and cash equivalents using Level 1 inputs that were based on quoted market prices.
The fair value of our Credit Facility that we entered into on October 31, 2018 approximates its carrying amount due to its variable interest rate and pricing grid that is dependent upon our leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
See Note (9) - "Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities" for further discussion of the favorable AT&T warranty settlement.
(6) Earnings Per Share 



Our basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares (including vested but unissued stock units, share units, performance shares and restricted stock units ("RSUs")), outstanding during each respective period.
Our diluted EPS reflects the dilution from potential common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of equity-classified stock-based awards, if dilutive, outstanding during each respective period.
Pursuant to FASB ASC 260 "Earnings Per Share," equity-classified stock-based awards that are subject to performance conditions are not considered in our diluted EPS calculations until the respective performance conditions have been satisfied.
When calculating our diluted earnings per share, we consider the amount an employee must pay upon assumed exercise of stock-based awards and the amount of stock-based compensation cost attributed to future services and not yet recognized.
There were no purchases of our common stock during the three or nine months ended April 30, 2019 or 2018.
See Note (18) - "Stockholders’ Equity" for more information.
Weighted average stock options, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding of 1,674,000 and 1,505,000 for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 1,103,000 and 1,804,000 for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were not included in our diluted EPS calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Our EPS calculations exclude 246,000 and 260,000 weighted average performance shares outstanding for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 242,000 and 257,000 for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as the performance conditions have not yet been satisfied.
However, the compensation expense related to these awards is included in net income (the numerator) for EPS calculations for each respective period.
The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators used in the basic and diluted EPS calculations:

(7) Accounts Receivable



Accounts receivable consist of the following at:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Unbilled receivables as of April 30, 2019 relate to contracts-in-progress for which revenue has been recognized, but for which we have not yet earned the right to bill the customer for work performed to-date.
Under ASC 606, which we adopted on August 1, 2018 (see Note (4) - "Revenue"), unbilled receivables constitute contract assets.
Management estimates that substantially all amounts not yet billed at April 30, 2019 will be billed and collected within one year.
As of April 30, 2019, the U.S. government (and its agencies) and Verizon represented 26.9% and 10.7%, respectively, of total accounts receivable.
As of July 31, 2018, the U.S. government (and its agencies) and Verizon represented 30.9% and 10.1%, respectively, of total accounts receivable.
(8) Inventories



Inventories consist of the following at:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of April 30, 2019 and July 31, 2018, the amount of inventory directly related to long-term contracts (including contracts-in-progress) was $2,513,000 and $1,249,000, respectively, and the amount of inventory related to contracts from third party commercial customers who outsource their manufacturing to us was $1,822,000 and $1,310,000, respectively.
Of this total amount, $1,679,000 and $400,000, respectively, was reclassified from the "accrued warranty obligations" and "other" categories presented in the above table to contract liabilities, as they represented deferred revenue related to service-type warranty performance obligations.
See Note (4) - "Revenue" for further discussion of our adoption of ASC 606.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2019, this matter was resolved in our favor.
As a result, we reduced such accrued legal costs and recorded a $3,204,000 benefit in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.
See Note (19) - "Legal Proceedings and Other Matters" for additional information.
Accrued warranty obligations as of April 30, 2019 relate to estimated liabilities for assurance-type warranty coverage that we provide to our customers.
We generally provide warranty coverage for some of our products for a period of at least one year from the date of delivery.
Changes in our accrued warranty obligations during the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Our current accrued warranty obligations at April 30, 2019 and July 31, 2018 include $4,013,000 and $4,650,000, respectively, of warranty obligations for a small product line that we refer to as the TCS 911 call handling software solution.
This solution was licensed to customers prior to our acquisition of TCS.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2018, we entered into a full and final warranty settlement with AT&T, the largest customer/distributor of this product line, pursuant to which we issued thirty-six credits to AT&T of $153,000 which AT&T can apply on a monthly basis to purchases of solutions from us, beginning October 2017 through September 2020.
In connection with this favorable settlement, during the nine months ended April 30, 2018, we recorded a benefit to cost of sales of $660,000.
In connection with our acquisition of Solacom and the GD NG-911 business, during the nine months ended April 30, 2019, we assumed warranty obligations related to certain contracts acquired.

(10) Cost Reduction Actions 



During the three months ended October 31, 2018, we took steps to improve our future operating results and successfully consolidated our Government Solutions segment’s manufacturing facility located in Tampa, Florida with another facility that we maintain in Orlando, Florida.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2019, we made cash payments of $358,000 related to such facility exit cost accrual.
To-date, we have incurred an immaterial amount of severance and retention costs related to our Florida facilities consolidation.
This evaluation and repositioning continued during the third quarter and is ongoing.
To date, we have ceased offering certain solutions, have worked with customers to wind-down certain legacy contracts and have not renewed certain contracts.
In connection with this ongoing repositioning, we recorded $2,465,000 and $6,351,000, respectively, of estimated contract settlement costs in our Commercial Solutions segment during the three and nine months ended April 30, 2019.
(11) Credit Facility 



On October 31, 2018, we entered into a First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Facility") with a syndicate of lenders, replacing our prior Credit Agreement dated as of February 23, 2016 (as amended by that certain First Amendment, dated as of June 6, 2017 (the "Prior Credit Facility")).
In connection with the establishment of our new Credit Facility, during the three months ended October 31, 2018, we wrote-off $3,217,000 of deferred financing costs primarily related to the Term Loan Facility portion of our Prior Credit Facility and capitalized deferred financing costs of $1,812,000 related to the new Credit Facility.
The new Credit Facility provides a senior secured loan facility of up to $550,000,000 consisting of: (i) a revolving loan facility ("Revolving Loan Facility") with a borrowing limit of $300,000,000; (ii) an accordion feature allowing us to borrow up to an additional $250,000,000; (iii) a $35,000,000 letter of credit sublimit; and (iv) a swingline loan credit sublimit of $25,000,000.
The Credit Facility matures on October 31, 2023 (the "Revolving Maturity Date").
If we issue new unsecured debt in excess of $5,000,000 with a maturity date that is less than 91 days from October 31, 2023, the Revolving Maturity Date would automatically accelerate so that it would be 91 days earlier than the maturity date of the new unsecured debt.
The proceeds of the new Credit Facility were used, in part, to repay in full the outstanding borrowings under the Prior Credit Facility, and additional proceeds of the Credit Facility are expected to be used by us for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
As of April 30, 2019, the amount outstanding under our Credit Facility was $173,500,000, which is reflected in the non-current portion of long-term debt on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Since October 31, 2018, we had outstanding balances under the new Credit Facility ranging from $150,000,000 to $184,000,000.
As of April 30, 2019, total net deferred financing costs related to the Credit Facility were $3,311,000 and are being amortized over the term of our Credit Facility through October 31, 2023.

Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 was $2,067,000 and $2,351,000, respectively.
The amount for the most recent fiscal quarter relates to our new Credit Facility; whereas, the amount in the comparable prior year period relates to our Prior Credit Facility.
Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 was $6,780,000 and $7,166,000, respectively.
The amount for the most recent fiscal year-to-date period relates to both our Prior Credit Facility and new Credit Facility; whereas, the amount in the comparable prior year period relates only to our Prior Credit Facility.
Our blended interest rate approximated 5.00% and 5.49%, respectively, for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, and approximated 5.36% and 5.29%, respectively, for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility shall be either: (i) Alternate Base Rate borrowings, which bear interest from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to (x) the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined) in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined) in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1.00% per annum and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined) on such day (or, if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) plus 1.00% per annum, plus (y) the Applicable Rate (as defined), or (ii) Eurodollar borrowings, which bear interest from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to (x) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such interest period plus (y) the Applicable Rate.
Determination of the Applicable Rate is based on a pricing grid that is dependent upon our Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined) as of the end of each fiscal quarter for which consolidated financial statements have been most recently delivered.
The Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants.
The Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants and customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate), such as payment defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency, the occurrence of a defined change in control and the failure to observe the negative covenants and other covenants related to the operation of our business.
The Credit Facility provides for, among other things: (i) a significant increase in our balance sheet flexibility; (ii) no scheduled payments of principal until maturity; (iii) a maximum Secured Leverage Ratio of 3.75x trailing twelve months ("TTM") Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") and a Maximum Total Leverage Ratio of 4.50x TTM Adjusted EBITDA, each with no step downs; (iv) a Minimum Interest Expense Coverage Ratio of 3.25x TTM Adjusted EBITDA; (v) reduced interest rates of approximately 25 basis points as compared to the Prior Credit Facility (based on our Secured Leverage Ratio as of July 31, 2018); and (vi) the elimination or relaxation of many restrictive covenants in our Prior Credit Facility.
As of April 30, 2019, our Secured Leverage Ratio was 1.77x TTM Adjusted EBITDA compared to the maximum allowable Secured Leverage Ratio of 3.75x TTM Adjusted EBITDA.
Our Interest Expense Coverage Ratio as of April 30, 2019 was 12.46x TTM Adjusted EBITDA compared to the Minimum Interest Expense Coverage Ratio of 3.25x TTM Adjusted EBITDA.
Given our expected future business performance, we anticipate maintaining compliance with the terms and financial covenants in our Credit Facility for the foreseeable future.
The obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries (the "Guarantors").
As collateral security under the Credit Facility and the guarantees thereof, we and the Guarantors have granted to the administrative agent, for the benefit of the lenders, a lien on, and first priority security interest in, substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets.
On December 6, 2018, we entered into the first amendment to the Credit Facility.
The purpose of the amendment is to provide for a mechanism to replace the LIBO Rate for Eurodollar borrowings with an alternative benchmark interest rate, should the LIBO Rate generally become unavailable in the future on an other-than-temporary basis.

Performance Shares, RSUs, Restricted Stock and Share Unit Awards



The following table summarizes the Plan's activity relating to performance shares, RSUs, restricted stock and share units:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The total intrinsic value relating to fully-vested awards settled during the three and nine months ended April 30, 2019 was $28,000 and $4,252,000, respectively.
The total intrinsic value relating to fully-vested awards settled during the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018 was $17,000 and $1,964,000, respectively.
The performance shares granted to employees since fiscal 2014 principally vest over a three-year performance period, if pre-established performance goals are attained or as specified pursuant to the Plan and related agreements.
As of April 30, 2019, the number of outstanding performance shares included in the above table, and the related compensation expense prior to consideration of estimated pre-vesting forfeitures, assume achievement of the pre-established goals at a target level.
RSUs and restricted stock granted to non-employee directors have a vesting period of three years and are convertible into shares of our common stock generally at the time of termination, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration, or earlier under certain circumstances.
RSUs granted to employees have a vesting period of five years and are convertible into shares of our common stock, generally at the time of vesting, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration.
Share units granted prior to July 31, 2017 were vested when issued and are convertible into shares of our common stock, generally at the time of termination, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration, or earlier under certain circumstances.
Share units granted on or after July 31, 2017 were granted to certain employees in lieu of non-equity incentive compensation and are convertible into shares of our common stock on the one-year anniversary of the respective grant date.
Cumulatively through April 30, 2019, 270,979 share units granted have been settled.
The fair value of performance shares, RSUs, restricted stock and share units is determined using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant, less the present value of any estimated future dividend equivalents such awards are not entitled to receive and an applicable estimated discount for post vesting restrictions.
RSUs, performance shares and restricted stock granted since fiscal 2013 are entitled to dividend equivalents unless forfeited before vesting occurs.
Share units granted since fiscal 2014 are entitled to dividend equivalents while the underlying shares are unissued.

(15) Segment Information



Reportable operating segments are determined based on Comtech’s management approach.
The management approach, as defined by FASB ASC 280 "Segment Reporting" is based on the way that the CODM organizes the segments within an enterprise for making decisions about resources to be allocated and assessing their performance.
Our CODM, for purposes of FASB ASC 280, is our Chief Executive Officer and President.
Our Commercial Solutions segment serves commercial customers and smaller government customers, such as state and local governments, that require advanced communication technologies to meet their needs.
This segment also serves certain large government customers (including the U.S. government) that have requirements for off-the-shelf commercial equipment.
We believe this segment is a leading provider of satellite communications (such as satellite earth station modems and TWTAs), public safety systems (such as NG-911 technologies) and enterprise application technologies (such as messaging and trusted location-based technologies).
Our Government Solutions segment serves large government end-users (including those of foreign countries) that require mission-critical technologies and systems.
Government solutions products include command and control applications (such as the design, installation and operation of data networks that integrate computing and communications, including both satellite and terrestrial links), ongoing network operation and management support services (including project management and fielding and maintenance solutions related to satellite ground terminals), troposcatter communications (such as digital troposcatter multiplexers, digital over-the-horizon modems, troposcatter systems and frequency converter systems) and RF power and switching technologies (such as solid-state high-power broadband amplifiers, identification friend or foe ("IFF") amplifiers and amplifiers used in the counteraction of improvised explosive devices).
Our CODM primarily uses a metric that we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA to measure an operating segment’s performance and to make decisions about resources to be allocated.
Our Adjusted EBITDA metric for the Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions segments do not consider any allocation of indirect expenses, or any of the following: income taxes, interest (income) and other, interest expense, write-off of deferred financing costs, amortization of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation expense, estimated contract settlement costs, facility exit costs, settlement of intellectual property litigation, acquisition plan expenses or strategic alternatives analysis expenses and other expenses that relate to our Unallocated segment.
Any amounts shown in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation for our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions segments are directly attributable to those segments.
Although closely aligned, the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA is different than the Consolidated EBITDA (as such term is defined in our Credit Facility) utilized for financial covenant calculations and also may differ from the definition of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA used by other companies and, therefore, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Unallocated expenses result from corporate expenses such as executive compensation, accounting, legal and other regulatory compliance related costs and also includes all of our amortization of stock-based compensation.
See Note (2) - "Acquisitions" for further information.
In addition, offsetting unallocated expenses for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 is a $3,204,000 benefit resulting from a favorable ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit related to a legacy TCS intellectual property matter.
See Note (19) - "Legal Proceedings and Other Matters" for further information.
Interest expenses in the tables above relate to our Prior Credit Facility and new Credit Facility and includes amortization of deferred financing costs.
In addition, during the three months ended October 31, 2018, we recorded a $3,217,000 loss from the write-off of deferred financing costs primarily related to the Term Loan Facility portion of our Prior Credit Facility.
See Note (11) - "Credit Facility" for further discussion.
Intersegment sales for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 by the Commercial Solutions segment to the Government Solutions segment were $1,413,000 and $2,664,000, respectively.
Intersegment sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 by the Commercial Solutions segment to the Government Solutions segment were $14,515,000 and $7,613,000, respectively.
There were nominal sales by the Government Solutions segment to the Commercial Solutions segment for these periods.
All intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation and are excluded from the tables above.
Unallocated assets at April 30, 2019 consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, income taxes receivable, corporate property, plant and equipment and deferred financing costs.
Substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the U.S. 



(16) Goodwill 



The following table represents goodwill by reportable operating segment, including the changes in the net carrying value of goodwill during the nine months ended April 30, 2019:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As discussed further in Note (2) -"Acquisitions," the goodwill resulting from the acquisitions of Solacom and the GD NG-911 business was based upon preliminary valuation and estimates and assumptions that are subject to change within the purchase price allocation period (generally one year from the acquisition date).
In accordance with FASB ASC 350 "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other," we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods.
If we fail the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment ("quantitative assessment"), we would be required to recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value; however, any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

On August 1, 2018 (the first day of our fiscal 2019), we performed our annual quantitative assessment using market participant assumptions to determine if the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded its carrying value.
In performing the quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approaches.
The income approach, also known as the discounted cash flow ("DCF") method, utilizes the present value of cash flows to estimate fair value.
The discount rates used in our DCF method were based on a weighted-average cost of capital ("WACC") determined from relevant market comparisons, adjusted upward for specific reporting unit risks (primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows).
A terminal value growth rate was applied to the final year of the projected period and reflected our estimate of stable, perpetual growth.
We then calculated a present value of the respective cash flows for each reporting unit to arrive at an estimate of fair value under the income approach.
Under the market approach, we estimated a fair value based on comparable companies' market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and factored in a control premium.
Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined that our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions reporting units had estimated fair values in excess of their carrying values of at least 42.5% and 105.5%, respectively, and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired and that neither of our two reporting units was at risk of failing the quantitative assessment.
In any event, we are required to perform the next annual goodwill impairment analysis on August 1, 2019 (the start of our fiscal 2020).

There were no repurchases made during the three or nine months ended April 30, 2019 or 2018.
Dividends 



Since September 2010, we have paid quarterly dividends pursuant to an annual targeted dividend amount that was established by our Board of Directors.
On September 26, 2018, December 6, 2018 and March 6, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, which was paid on November 16, 2018, February 15, 2019 and May 17, 2019, respectively.
On June 5, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable on August 16, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 17, 2019.
Future dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under our Credit Facility as well as Board approval.
TCS defended Verizon against Vehicle IP.
In January 2019, we received a ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upholding the District Court's claim construction in our favor.
Consequently, we and Vehicle IP filed a joint stipulation requesting a judgment of non-infringement, which judgment was entered on March 5, 2019.
Legacy TCS 911 Call Handling Software Matter



During the three months ended January 31, 2019, a customer that purchased a TCS 911 call handling software solution in December 2014 (which was more than one year prior to our acquisition of TCS) (the "TCS Legacy Customer") informed us that it experienced several network outages and that it would seek indemnification for any claims made against it as a result of such outages.
Nevertheless, we have submitted notification to our insurance carriers for review and consideration of coverage for potential liability that may arise from these matters.
In connection with these outages, the TCS Legacy Customer informed us that it believed certain communication failover redundancies promised to it by former senior management of TCS were never completed and has demanded that we refund to it all amounts previously paid to us under the contract, which through April 30, 2019 was approximately $14,600,000.
Based on such ongoing review, we believe that TCS has complied with its contractual requirements and that the customer is not entitled to any such reimbursement.
Our contract to provide services to this customer expires in December 2019 and the amount of annual revenue we generate from this customer is immaterial.
In an attempt to resolve the issues, the parties agreed to non-binding mediation process, which commenced in April 2019.
We also filed a lawsuit in March 2019 against a former employee and her new employer arising from such former employee's violation of her obligation to TCS of confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation of customers, including the TCS Legacy Customer.
The former employee has responded with her own lawsuit against us.

Other Matters 



In October 2014, we disclosed to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") that we learned during a self-assessment of our export transactions that a shipment of modems sent to a Canadian customer by Comtech EF Data Corp. was incorporated into a communication system, the ultimate end user of which was the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority.
The sales value of this equipment was approximately $288,000.
At the time of shipment, OFAC regulations prohibited U.S. persons from doing business directly or indirectly with Sudan.
In late 2015, OFAC issued an administrative subpoena seeking information about the disclosed transaction.
We responded to the subpoena, including alerting OFAC to Comtech’s repair of three modems for a customer in Lebanon who may have rerouted the modems from Lebanon to Sudan without the required U.S. licensing authorization.
In September 2018, Comtech agreed to enter into a Tolling Agreement with OFAC, which extends the statute of limitations in this matter through December 31, 2019.
The Tolling Agreement was shortly followed by a second administrative subpoena seeking additional information about the disclosed transaction.
In December 2018, Comtech responded to a second administrative subpoena from OFAC, answering the questions it posed and providing all the documents it sought.
U.S. sanctions with respect to Sudan were revoked in 2017.
Consistent with the revocation of the Sudan Sanction Regulations ("SSR"), shipments to the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority by U.S. persons are now permissible.
Even though we take precautions to avoid engaging in transactions that may violate U.S. trade sanctions, those measures may not be effective in every instance.
In May 2018, we were informed by the Office of Export Enforcement ("OEE") of the Department of Commerce ("DoC") that it was forwarding to the DoC's Office of Chief Counsel, the results of its audit of international shipments by Comtech Xicom Technology, Inc. for further review and possible determination of an administrative penalty.
These six (6) items, for which export licenses were not obtained, were either spares or repaired power amplifier subassembly components valued at less than $100,000 (in aggregate) and were shipped to Brazil, Italy, Russia, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates.
The EAR provides an exception to the requirement to obtain an export license for the replacement of a defective or damaged component.
Since discovering this issue, we have implemented additional controls and procedures and have increased awareness of these specific export requirements throughout the Company to help avoid similar occurrences in the future.
Administrative penalties under the EAR can range from a warning letter to a denial of export privileges.
A civil monetary penalty not to exceed the amount set forth in the Export Administration Act ("EAA") may be imposed for each violation, and in the event that any provision of the EAR is continued by any other authority, the maximum monetary civil penalty for each violation shall be that provided by such other authority.
Administrative penalties under the EAR are currently determined pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ("IEEPA"), which can reach the greater of twice the amount of the transaction that is the basis of the violation or approximately $300,000 per violation.
We have not recorded an accrual related to a possible administrative penalty and continue to work cooperatively with the OEE.
We may also, from time to time, receive indemnification requests from customers related to third-party claims that 911 calls were improperly routed during an emergency.
We evaluate such claims as and when they arise.
We do not always agree with customers that they are entitled to indemnification and in such cases reject their claims.
There are certain other pending and threatened legal actions which arise in the normal course of business.
