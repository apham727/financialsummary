Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
Depreciation and amortization remained relatively consistent for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017. Depreciation expense fluctuates due to variable estimated useful lives of depreciable property (as identified in Note 2, Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements) as well as the amount and nature of capital expenditures in current and previous periods. It is anticipated that the Company’s future capital expenditures and related depreciation and amortization expense will follow the Company’s requirements to support its manufacturing delivery commitments and to implement certain information technology improvements.
