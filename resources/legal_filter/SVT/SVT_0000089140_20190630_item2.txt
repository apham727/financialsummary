Revenue 
The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $3,565,000 or 15.8% for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. During this period both the ATG and CPG increased commercial shipments by approximately $2,920,000 and $234,000, respectively. In addition, the ATG increased government shipments by approximately $437,000. This was partially offset by the CPG government shipments decrease of approximately $26,000. 
The Company’s consolidated revenues from operations increased approximately $2,121,000 or 17.8% for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. During this period both the ATG and CPG increased commercial shipments by approximately $1,642,000 and $293,000, respectively. In addition, the ATG increased government shipments by approximately $235,000. This was partially offset by the CPG government shipments decrease of approximately $49,000. 
Gross Margin 
The Company’s consolidated gross margin for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 increased approximately $368,000 or 7.4% when compared to the same period in 2018. 
Gross margin increased in the six month period ended June 30, 2019 due to the increase in units shipped of approximately $740,000 at the ATG. In addition, the increase is due to average prices and mix of product sold of approximately $230,000 at the ATG and approximately $851,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period of 2018. This is partially offset by a decrease in units shipped of approximately $1,453,000 at the CPG as compared to the same period of 2018. 
The Company’s consolidated gross margin for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 increased approximately $345,000 or 11.8% when compared to the same period in 2018. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
Interest expense increased by 9.6% and 11.1% in the six and three month periods ended June 30, 2019, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2018. This is primarily due to the higher interest rates on the bank loans and a full year of interest paid on the equipment financing lease obligations. 
Net Income 
Net income for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 decreased approximately $226,000. This decrease is primarily the result of increases in revenue at both the ATG and CPG business segments offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses at both business segments. Net income for the three month period ended June 30, 2019 increased approximately $7,000, when compared to the same periods in 2018. This increase is primarily the result of increases in revenue at both the ATG and CPG business segments partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses at both business segments. 
The Company’s primary liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relate to working capital needs; primarily inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and principal payments on debt. At June 30, 2019, the Company had working capital of approximately $22,805,000 ($23,141,000 – 2018) of which approximately $1,849,000 ($2,598,000 – 2018) was comprised of cash. The improvement in working capital is attributable to a decrease in number of day’s accounts receivable outstanding, an increase in the number of day’s accounts payable outstanding and an improvement in inventory turns. 
The Company generated approximately $638,000 in cash from operations during the six month period ended June 30, 2019 as compared to a usage of cash of approximately $237,000 during the same period in 2018. Cash was generated primarily through net income of approximately $812,000, adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash of approximately $677,000 and timing of accounts payable of approximately $1,195,000. The primary use of cash for the Company’s operating activities for the six month period ended June 30, 2019 include working capital requirements, mainly an increase in accounts receivables and inventories of approximately $356,000 and $1,780,000, respectively. Cash generated and used in operations is consistent with sales volume, customer expectations and competitive pressures. 
The Company’s primary generation of cash in its financing and investing activities in the six month period ended June 30, 2019 included approximately $601,000 of proceeds from equipment financing. This is offset by the usage of cash due to approximately $274,000 of principal payments on long-term debt, approximately $149,000 for the purchase of treasury shares, as well as capital expenditures of approximately $1,140,000 to increase production requirements at the ATG. 
The Company has an equipment loan facility in the amount of $2,500,000 available until November 30, 2019. This line is non-revolving and non-renewable. The loan term for the equipment covered by the agreement is 60 months. Monthly payments will be fixed for the term of each funding based upon the Lender’s pricing in effect at the time of such funding. There was approximately $601,000 outstanding at June 30, 2019 and no balance outstanding at December 31, 2018.
