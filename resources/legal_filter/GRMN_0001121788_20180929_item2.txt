This report has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC” or the “Commission”) in Washington, D.C. and can be obtained by contacting the SEC’s public reference operations or obtaining it through the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.
Readers are strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any forward-looking statement concerning the Company.
The Company is a leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS, technology.
The Company’s segments offer products through its network of independent dealers and distributors.
As such, the segments are managed separately.
The Company adopted the new accounting standard for revenue recognition, as discussed in Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, effective beginning with the Company’s first quarter of 2018.

(Amounts included in the following discussion are stated in thousands unless otherwise indicated) 



Net Sales 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Net sales increased 8% for the 13-week period ended September 29, 2018 when compared to the year-ago quarter.
The outdoor, aviation, marine, and fitness segments collectively increased by 16%, contributing 80% of total revenue.
Outdoor was the largest portion of our revenue mix at 26% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 25% in the third quarter of 2017.
Auto revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in the third quarter of 2017 at 26% and declined to 20% in the third quarter of 2018.
Total unit sales in the third quarter of 2018 increased to 3,527 when compared to total unit sales of 3,492 in the third quarter of 2017.
Auto segment revenue decreased 16% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction.
Outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation segment revenue increased 13%, 14%, 28%, and 17%, respectively, when compared to the year-ago quarter.
The outdoor and fitness segment revenue increases were primarily driven by strong sales in wearables.
The aviation segment revenue increase was driven by increased sales across most product lines within the segment.
Cost of Goods Sold  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Cost of goods sold increased 5% in absolute dollars compared to the prior year quarter.
The outdoor segment decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue was primarily due to product mix.
The fitness segment increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue was primarily driven by product mix.
The aviation segment decrease in cost of goods as a percent of revenue was primarily driven by a reduction in warranty costs compared to the year-ago quarter.
24 



Gross Profit 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Gross profit dollars in the third quarter of 2018 increased 10% while gross margin increased 110 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter.
Advertising Expense 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Advertising expense decreased 4% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue compared to the year-ago quarter.
The total absolute dollar decrease was driven primarily by decreased media advertising in the auto and fitness segments, partially offset by increased media advertising in the outdoor and marine segments.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Selling, general and administrative expense increased 13% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue compared to the year-ago quarter.
The absolute dollar increase in the third quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to personnel costs and expenses from recent acquisitions.
25 



Research and Development Expense 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Research and development expense increased $9.3 million in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue compared to the year-ago quarter.
Our research and development spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories.
Operating Income 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Operating income increased 13% in absolute dollars and increased 110 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the year-ago quarter.
The growth in operating income in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue was primarily attributable to revenue growth and increased gross margins, as discussed above.
Other Income (Expense)  



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The average return on cash and investments, including interest and capital gains/losses, during the third quarter of 2018 was 1.8% compared to 1.6% during the same quarter of 2017.
Interest income increased primarily due to slightly higher yields on fixed-income securities.
Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar.
The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds.
The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.
Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
26 



The $6.9 million currency loss recognized in the third quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling within the 13-weeks ended September 29, 2018.
During this period, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 0.7% against the Euro and 1.3% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $2.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar remained relatively flat against the Taiwan Dollar.
The remaining net currency loss of $3.6 million was related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
The $8.6 million currency gain recognized in the third quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Taiwan Dollar within the 13-weeks ended September 30, 2017.
During this period, the U.S. Dollar weakened 3.4% against the Euro and 2.8% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $8.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 0.3% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $1.6 million.
The remaining net currency gain of $1.5 million was related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
The effective tax rate was 8.5% in the third quarter of 2018, compared to 20.5% in the third quarter of 2017.
The 1,200 basis points decrease to the third quarter of 2018 effective tax rate compared to the prior year quarter is primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate and increased benefit from U.S. research and development tax credits.
Net Income  



As a result of the above, net income for the 13-weeks ended September 29, 2018 was $184.2 million compared to $151.1 million for the 13-week period ended September 30, 2017, an increase of $33.1 million.

The average return on cash and investments, including interest and capital gains/losses, during the 39-week period ended September 29, 2018 was 1.8% compared to 1.5% during the same 39-week period ended September 30, 2017.
Interest income increased primarily due to slightly higher yields on fixed-income securities.
The $3.4 million currency loss recognized in the first three quarters of 2018 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against most other currencies, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar within the 39-weeks ended September 29, 2018.
During this period, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 2.7% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of $13.6 million.
This was more than offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening 3.2% against the Euro and 3.6% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $7.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively, and additional net currency losses of $8.7 million related to other currencies and timing of transactions.
The $13.8 million currency loss recognized in the first three quarters of 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling within the 39-weeks ended September 30, 2017.
During this period, the U.S. Dollar weakened 7.1% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $43.1 million, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 12.3% against the Euro and 8.6% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $22.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 



As of September 29, 2018, we had $2.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.
We primarily use cash flow from operations, and expect that future cash requirements may be used, to fund our capital expenditures, support our working capital requirements, pay dividends, fund strategic acquisitions, and fund share repurchases.
We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our long-term projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements.

It is management’s goal to invest the on-hand cash in accordance with the investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors of each applicable Garmin entity holding the cash.
The investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk.
Garmin’s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during the first three quarters of 2018 and 2017 were approximately 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively.
See Note 8 for additional information regarding marketable securities.
Operating Activities 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The $239.2 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in the first three quarters of 2018 compared to the first three quarters of 2017 was primarily due to the increase in cash provided by working capital of $107.1 million (which included an increase of $27.7 million in net receipts of accounts receivable, a decrease of $18.7 million in cash paid for inventory, and an increase of $57.1 million in accounts payable) and income taxes payable of $27.8 million.
Investing Activities 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The $149.7 million increase in cash used in investing activities in the first three quarters of 2018 compared to the first three quarters of 2017 was primarily due to increased net purchases of marketable securities of $102.4 million and higher cash expenditures for purchases of property and equipment of $36.6 million.
Financing Activities 



 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The $66.6 million decrease in cash used in financing activities during the first three quarters of 2018 compared to the first three quarters of 2017 was primarily due to prior year treasury stock purchases of $74.5 million under our share repurchase authorization, which expired on December 31, 2017.
