 1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies  
 Basis of Presentation  
 Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 are to our fiscal years ending September 27, 2019 and ended September 28, 2018, respectively.  
 Revenue Recognition  
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02 which codified ASC 842, Leases. This guidance, as subsequently amended, requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for most leases and is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are currently in the process of updating policies, internal controls, financial statement disclosures, and systems to incorporate the impact of the new standard in our financial reporting processes. We intend to adopt the standard using the optional transition method permitted by ASU No. 2018-11, which allows for application of the standard at the adoption date and no restatement of comparative periods. We expect that adoption will likely have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet; however, we currently do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. We believe that we are following an appropriate timeline to allow for the proper recognition, reporting, and disclosure of leases upon adoption of ASC 842 at the beginning of fiscal 2020.  
 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  
 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, an update to ASC 740, Income Taxes. This guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory in the period in which the transfer occurs. The update was adopted on a modified retrospective basis in the quarter ended December 28, 2018 and resulted in a $443 million cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings, which represented the net reversal of all balances associated with deferred tax impacts of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This included a decrease in other assets of $798 million, an increase in deferred tax assets of $418 million, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $63 million on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
 2. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net  
 Prior to fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting all segments. Also prior to fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment. During the six months ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018, we recorded net restructuring charges of $5 million and $9 million, respectively, related to pre-fiscal 2018 actions. We expect additional charges related to pre-fiscal 2018 actions to be insignificant.  
 Total Restructuring Reserves  
 During the six months ended March 29, 2019, we sold our Subsea Communications (“SubCom”) business for net cash proceeds of $297 million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $86 million, related primarily to the recognition of cumulative translation adjustment losses of $67 million and the guarantee liabilities discussed below. The SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and was reported as such in all periods presented on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the SubCom business was included in the Communications Solutions segment.  
 (1) At March 29, 2019 and September 28, 2018, accumulated impairment losses for the Transportation Solutions, Industrial Solutions, and Communications Solutions segments were $2,191 million, $669 million, and $489 million, respectively.   
 Intangible asset amortization expense was $45 million for the quarters ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018 and $90 million for the six months ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018.  
 During the six months ended March 29, 2019, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our 100%-owned subsidiary, issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due June 2020. The notes bear interest at a rate of three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 0.45% per year. The notes are TEGSA’s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.  
 During the six months ended March 29, 2019, TEGSA repaid, at maturity, $325 million 2.375% senior notes due 2018.   
 TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with total commitments of $1,500 million. The Credit Facility was amended in November 2018 primarily to extend the maturity date from December 2020 to November 2023. The amended Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to $500 million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at March 29, 2019 or September 28, 2018.  
 As of March 29, 2019, TEGSA had $360 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.63%. TEGSA had $270 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.35% at September 28, 2018.  
 The fair value of our debt, based on indicative valuations, was approximately $4,172 million and $4,149 million at March 29, 2019 and September 28, 2018, respectively.  
 Guarantees  
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  
 During fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of €1,000 million to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans. Under the terms of these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, we make interest payments in euros at 3.50% per annum and receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 5.33% per annum. Upon the maturity of these contracts in fiscal 2022, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in euros and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties. In connection with the cross-currency swap contracts, both counterparties to each contract are required to post cash collateral.  
 During fiscal 2019, we expanded our cross-currency swap program to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations. The aggregate notional value of the fiscal 2019 contracts was $1,901 million at March 29, 2019. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 3.00% per annum and pay no interest. Upon the maturity of these contracts at various dates through fiscal 2023, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in the designated foreign currencies and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties.  
 (2) Gains and losses on cross-currency swap contracts designated as hedges of net investment are recorded as currency translation.  
 During the six months ended March 29, 2019, we contributed $19 million to our non-U.S. pension plans.  
 Tax Sharing Agreement  
 12. Earnings Per Share  
 Common Shares Held in Treasury  
 In March 2019, our shareholders approved the cancellation of 6 million shares purchased under our share repurchase program during the period beginning September 30, 2017 and ending September 28, 2018. The capital reduction by cancellation of these shares is subject to a notice period and filing with the commercial register in Switzerland and is not yet reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
 Dividends  
 In March 2019, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of $1.84 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of $0.46 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.  
 Upon shareholders’ approval of a dividend payment, we record a liability with a corresponding charge to shareholders’ equity. At March 29, 2019 and September 28, 2018, the unpaid portion of the dividends recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $620 million and $303 million, respectively.  
 As of March 29, 2019, there was $150 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to share-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.
