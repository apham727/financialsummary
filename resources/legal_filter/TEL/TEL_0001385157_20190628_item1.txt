1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 are to our fiscal years ending September 27, 2019 and ended September 28, 2018, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which introduced a single, comprehensive, five-step revenue recognition model. Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract, such as a purchase order with a customer, are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control. We transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers, the customers accept and have legal title for the product, and we have a right to payment for such product. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations, we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities. Our credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient of ASC 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations as of June 28, 2019. See Note 16 for net sales disaggregated by industry end market and geographic region which is summarized by segment and that we consider meaningful to depict the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows affected by economic factors.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02 which codified ASC 842, Leases. This guidance, as subsequently amended, requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for most leases and is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are currently in the process of updating policies, internal controls, financial statement disclosures, and systems to incorporate the impact of the new standard in our financial reporting processes. We intend to adopt the standard using the optional transition method permitted by ASU No. 2018-11, which allows for application of the standard at the adoption date and no restatement of comparative periods. We expect that adoption will likely have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet; however, we currently do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. We believe that we are following an appropriate timeline to allow for the proper recognition, reporting, and disclosure of leases upon adoption of ASC 842 at the beginning of fiscal 2020.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, an update to ASC 740, Income Taxes. This guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory in the period in which the transfer occurs. The update was adopted on a modified retrospective basis in the quarter ended December 28, 2018 and resulted in a $443 million cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning accumulated earnings, which represented the net reversal of all balances associated with deferred tax impacts of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This included a decrease in other assets of $798 million, an increase in deferred tax assets of $418 million, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $63 million on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
2. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net
During fiscal 2019, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements impacting all segments. In connection with this program, during the nine months ended June 28, 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $179 million. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during the nine months ended June 28, 2019 by the end of fiscal 2021 and to incur additional charges of approximately $25 million related primarily to employee severance in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments.
During fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation and structural improvements primarily impacting the Industrial Solutions and Transportation Solutions segments. In connection with this program, during the nine months ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018, we recorded net restructuring charges of $5 million and $109 million, respectively. We expect to complete all restructuring actions commenced during fiscal 2018 by the end of fiscal 2020 and anticipate that any additional charges will be insignificant.
Prior to fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with footprint consolidation related to recent acquisitions and structural improvements impacting all segments. Also prior to fiscal 2018, we initiated a restructuring program associated with headcount reductions impacting all segments and product line closures in the Communications Solutions segment. During the nine months ended June 29, 2018, we recorded net restructuring charges of $9 million related to pre-fiscal 2018 actions. We expect additional charges related to pre-fiscal 2018 actions to be insignificant.
Total Restructuring Reserves
During the nine months ended June 28, 2019, we sold our Subsea Communications (“SubCom”) business for net cash proceeds of $297 million and incurred a pre-tax loss on sale of $86 million, related primarily to the recognition of cumulative translation adjustment losses of $67 million and the guarantee liabilities discussed below. The SubCom business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and was reported as such in all periods presented on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the SubCom business was included in the Communications Solutions segment.
During the nine months ended June 28, 2019, we acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of $296 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Transportation Solutions segment from the date of acquisition.
During the nine months ended June 28, 2019, we recognized goodwill in the Transportation Solutions segment in connection with recent acquisitions. See Note 4 for additional information regarding acquisitions.
7. Intangible Assets, Net
Intangible asset amortization expense was $45 million for the quarters ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018 and $135 million for the nine months ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018.
During the quarter ended June 28, 2019, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. (“TEGSA”), our 100%-owned subsidiary, issued €350 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due June 2021. The fixed-to-floating rate senior notes bear interest at a rate of 0% until June 2020 and then at a rate of three-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) plus 0.30% per year until maturity. In June 2020, we may, at our option, redeem the fixed-to-floating rate senior notes, as a whole, at 100% of the principal amount. Also, during the nine months ended June 28, 2019, TEGSA issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due June 2020. The floating rate senior notes bear interest at a rate of three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 0.45% per year. The fixed-to-floating rate senior notes and floating rate senior notes are TEGSA’s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.
During the nine months ended June 28, 2019, TEGSA repaid, at maturity, $325 million 2.375% senior notes due 2018. 
TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with total commitments of $1,500 million. The Credit Facility was amended in November 2018 primarily to extend the maturity date from December 2020 to November 2023. The amended Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to $500 million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at June 28, 2019 or September 28, 2018.
As of September 28, 2018, TEGSA had $270 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.35%. TEGSA had no commercial paper outstanding at June 28, 2019.
The fair value of our debt, based on indicative valuations, was approximately $4,295 million and $4,149 million at June 28, 2019 and September 28, 2018, respectively.
9. Commitments and Contingencies
At June 28, 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of $316 million. 
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
During fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of €1,000 million to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans. Under the terms of these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, we make interest payments in euros at 3.50% per annum and receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 5.33% per annum. Upon the maturity of these contracts in fiscal 2022, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in euros and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties. In connection with the cross-currency swap contracts, both counterparties to each contract are required to post cash collateral.
We hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany loans and external borrowings denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $3,202 million and $4,064 million at June 28, 2019 and September 28, 2018, respectively. 
During fiscal 2019, we expanded our cross-currency swap program to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations. The aggregate notional value of the fiscal 2019 contracts was $1,901 million at June 28, 2019. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 2.96% per annum and pay no interest. Upon the maturity of these contracts at various dates through fiscal 2023, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in the designated foreign currencies and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties.
During the nine months ended June 28, 2019, we contributed $29 million to our non-U.S. pension plans.
Swiss Tax Reform
Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing in September 2018, and it was approved by public vote on May 19, 2019. Swiss Tax Reform eliminates certain preferential tax items at both the federal and cantonal levels. In addition, the cantons will implement new tax rates. The federal provisions of Swiss Tax Reform are expected to be enacted into law in the quarter ending September 27, 2019 and the cantons will implement thereafter.
