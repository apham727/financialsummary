SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES UPDATE



Our significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2018.
On October 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606).
Significant changes to our policies resulting from the adoption are provided below.
We adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to contracts that were not substantially complete at the end of fiscal year 2018.
We recorded a $4.2 million adjustment to increase retained earnings to reflect the cumulative impact of adopting this standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2019, primarily related to certain long-term contracts our Filtration and Technical Packaging segments have that converted to the cost-to-cost method for revenue recognition.
The comparative information has not been restated and is reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
A reconciliation of the financial statement line items impacted for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 under ASC 606 to the prior accounting standards is provided in Note 14.
Revenue Recognition



Revenue is recognized when control of the goods or services promised under the contract is transferred to the customer either at a point in time (e.g., upon delivery) or over time (e.g., as we perform under the contract).
Contracts are reviewed to determine whether there is one or multiple performance obligations.
A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer and represents the unit of accounting for revenue recognition.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the expected consideration, or the transaction price, is allocated to each performance obligation identified in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation.
Revenue is then recognized for the transaction price allocated to the performance obligation when control of the promised goods or services underlying the performance obligation is transferred.
Payment terms with customers vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered.
Arrangements with customers that include payment terms extending beyond one year are not significant.
The related contracts are with commercial and military customers and have a single performance obligation as there is only one good promised or the promise to transfer the goods or services is not distinct or separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.
Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in the transaction price as the related activities are performed prior to customer obtaining control of the products.
These assurance-type programs typically cannot be purchased separately and do not meet the criteria to be considered a performance obligation.
Approximately 52% of the segment’s revenues (approximately 19% of consolidated revenues) are accounted for over time as the product does not have an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for costs incurred plus a reasonable margin or the inventory is owned by the customer.
The contracts may contain multiple products, which are capable of being distinct as the customer could benefit from each product on its own or together with other readily available resources.
Each product is separately identifiable from the other products in the contract.
Therefore, each product is distinct in context of the contract and will be accounted for as a separate performance obligation.
Most of our contract modifications are for products that are not distinct from the existing contract and are accounted for as part of that existing contract.
Selecting the method to measure progress towards completion for the commercial and military contracts requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or service to be provided.
We generally use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress for our Filtration segment contracts the rate at which costs are incurred to fulfill a contract best depicts the transfer of control to the customer.
Under this measure, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation, and revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred based on an estimated profit margin.
Certain of our long-term contracts contain incentive fees that can increase the transaction price.
These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion.
8 



Total contract cost is estimated utilizing current contract specifications and expected engineering requirements.
Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals.
Under the typical payment terms of our long term fixed price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based or progress payments.
Performance-based payments represent interim payments based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones.
Progress payments are interim payments of costs incurred as the work progresses.
Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified in Accounts receivable, net.
For short term fixed price and cost-type contracts, we are generally paid within a short period of time.
This method recognizes the cumulative effect of changes on current and prior periods with the impact of the change from inception-to-date recorded in the current period.
Anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable.
The related contracts are with commercial customers.
The contracts may contain multiple products which are capable of being distinct as the customer could benefit from each product on its own or together with other readily available resources.
Each product is separately identifiable from the other products in the contract.
Therefore, each product is distinct in context of the contract and will be accounted for as a separate performance obligation.
Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in the transaction price as the related activities are performed prior to customer obtaining control of the products.
These assurance-type programs typically cannot be purchased separately and do not meet the criteria to be considered a performance obligation.
Products accounted for under this guidance include the construction and installation of test chambers to a buyer’s specifications that provide its customers with the ability to measure and contain magnetic, electromagnetic and acoustic energy.
The goods and services related to each installed test chamber are not distinct due to the significant amount of integration provided and each installed chamber is accounted for as a single performance obligation.
Selecting the method to measure progress towards completion for these contracts requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products and service to be provided.
We use milestones to measure progress for our Test segment contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts.

Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in the transaction price as the related activities are performed prior to customer obtaining control of the products.
These assurance-type programs typically cannot be purchased separately and do not meet the criteria to be considered a performance obligation.
Approximately 20% of the segment’s revenues (approximately 6% of consolidated revenues) are recognized over time as services are performed.
The services accounted for under this method include an obligation to provide testing services using hardware and embedded software, software maintenance, training, lab testing, and consulting services.
The related contracts contain a bundle of goods and services that are integrated in the context of the contract.
Therefore, the goods and services are not distinct and the Company has a single performance obligation.
Selecting the method to measure progress towards completion for these contracts requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products and service to be provided.
We will recognize revenue as a series of distinct services based on each day of providing services (straight-line over the contract term) for our USG segment contracts.
Under the typical payment terms of our service contracts, the customer pays us in advance of when services are performed.
10 



Included in this category, approximately 8% of the segment’s revenues (approximately 2% of consolidated revenues) are recognized based on the terms of the software contract.
For contracts that transfer a software license to the customer, revenue will be recognized at a point in time.
For contracts in software as a service (SaaS) arrangements, revenue will be recognized over time.
The customer receives and consumes the benefits of the SaaS arrangement through access to the system which is for a stated period.
We will recognize revenue based on each day of providing access (straight-line over the contract term).
Under the typical payment terms of our software contracts, the customer pays us in advance of when services are performed.
Technical Packaging: Within the Technical Packaging segment, 100% of the revenues (approximately 10% of consolidated revenues) are recognized over time as the product does not have an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment.
Selecting the method to measure progress towards completion for the contracts requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products to be provided.
We use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress for our Technical Packaging segment contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts.

Under the typical payment terms of our contracts, the customer is billed upon shipment of product.
Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified in Accounts receivable, net.
This method recognizes the cumulative effect of changes on current and prior periods with the impact of the change from inception-to-date recorded in the current period.
Anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable.
These amounts are included in contract assets until the right to payment is no longer conditional on events other than the passage of time.
These contract assets are reclassified to receivables when the right to consideration becomes unconditional.

EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)



Basic EPS is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of dilutive common share options and vesting of performance-accelerated restricted shares (restricted shares) by using the treasury stock method.
The number of shares used in the calculation of earnings per share for each period presented is as follows (in thousands):

7. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION



The Company is organized based on the products and services that it offers, and classifies its business operations in four reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Filtration/Fluid Flow (Filtration), RF Shielding and Test (Test), Utility Solutions Group (USG) and Technical Packaging.
The Filtration segment’s operations consist of PTI Technologies Inc. (PTI), VACCO Industries (VACCO), Crissair, Inc. (Crissair), Westland Technologies Inc. (Westland), and Mayday Manufacturing Co. and its affiliate Hi-Tech Metals, Inc. (collectively referred to as Mayday).
The Test segment’s operations consist primarily of ETS-Lindgren Inc. 



(ETS-Lindgren).
ETS-Lindgren is an industry leader in providing its customers with the ability to identify, measure and contain magnetic, electromagnetic and acoustic energy.
The USG segment’s operations consist primarily of Doble Engineering Company (Doble), Morgan Schaffer Inc. (Morgan Schaffer), and NRG Systems, Inc. (NRG).
Doble provides high-end, intelligent diagnostic test solutions for the electric power delivery industry and is a leading supplier of partial discharge testing instruments used to assess the integrity of high voltage power delivery equipment.
Morgan Schaffer provides an integrated offering of dissolved gas analysis, oil testing, and data management solutions for the electric power industry.
NRG designs and manufactures decision support tools for the renewable energy industry, primarily wind.
The Technical Packaging segment’s operations consist of Thermoform Engineered Quality LLC (TEQ) and Plastique Limited and Plastique Sp.
z o.o.
(together, Plastique).
The companies within this segment provide innovative solutions to the medical and commercial markets for thermoformed packages and specialty products using a wide variety of thin gauge plastics and pulp.
EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and taxes.
EBIT on a consolidated basis is a non-GAAP financial measure.
Management believes that EBIT is useful in assessing the operational profitability of the Company’s business segments because it excludes interest and taxes, which are generally accounted for across the entire Company on a consolidated basis.
EBIT is also one of the measures used by 



14 



management in determining resource allocations within the Company as well as incentive compensation.
The Company believes that the presentation of EBIT provides important supplemental information to investors to facilitate comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.
Furthermore, the use of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to replace any measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP.
8.
DEBT



The Company’s debt is summarized as follows:



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



The Company’s existing credit facility (“the Credit Facility”) matures December 21, 2020.
The Credit Facility includes a $450 million revolving line of credit as well as provisions allowing for the increase of the credit facility commitment amount by an additional $250 million, if necessary, with the consent of the lenders.
The bank syndication supporting the facility is comprised of a diverse group of nine banks led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent.
At June 30, 2019, the Company had approximately $225 million available to borrow under the Credit Facility, and a $250 million increase option, in addition to $39.0 million cash on hand.
At June 30, 2019, the Company had $217.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, and $0.9 million of short-term borrowing in addition to outstanding letters of credit of $7.2 million.
The Company classified $20.9 million as the current portion of long-term debt as of June 30, 2019, as the Company intends to repay this amount within the next twelve month period; however, the Company has no contractual obligation to repay such amount during the next twelve month period.
The Credit Facility requires, as determined by certain financial ratios, a facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 27.5 basis points per year on the unused portion.
The terms of the facility provide that interest on borrowings may be calculated at a spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or based on the prime rate, at the Company’s election.
The facility is secured by the unlimited guaranty of the Company’s material domestic subsidiaries and a 65% pledge of the material foreign subsidiaries’ share equity.
The financial covenants of the Credit Facility include a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio.
The weighted average interest rates were 3.21% and 3.22% for the three and nine-month periods ending June 30, 2019, respectively, and 3.17% and 2.97% for the corresponding periods of 2018.
At June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.
9.
INCOME TAX EXPENSE



The third quarter 2019 effective income tax rate was 19.4% compared to 18.4% in the third quarter of 2018.
The income tax expense for the first nine months of 2019 was $13.3 million compared to income tax benefit of $14.0 million for the first nine months of 2018.
The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 was 19.2% compared to (28.1)% for the first nine months of 2018.
The income tax expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 was favorably impacted by tax planning strategies to increase foreign tax credits claimed retrospectively.
The Company reduced the valuation allowance for excess foreign tax credits by $2.4 million ($2.3 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $0.1 million in third quarter of 2019) and recorded an amended return benefit of $0.3 million ($0.2 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $0.1 million in the third quarter of 2019) which favorably impacted the third quarter and year-to-date effective 



15 



tax rate by 1.0% and 4.1%, respectively.
Income tax expense in the third quarter of 2019 and first nine months of 2019 was also favorably impacted by additional tax benefits on share-based compensation that vested during the quarter decreasing the effective tax rate by 1.8% and 0.7%, respectively.
A non-automatic accounting method change filed with the 2018 tax return was approved by the Internal Revenue Service during the third quarter of 2019 and favorably impacted the third quarter and year-to-date effective tax rate by 1.0% and 0.4%, respectively.
H.R.
1, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), was signed into law on December 22, 2017.
The total impact of the TCJA in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 was a net expense of $0.1 million and a net benefit of $24.3 million, respectively.
The impacts were as follows: First, the Company’s 2018 federal statutory rate dropped from 35.0% to 24.5% which required an adjustment to the value of its deferred tax assets and liabilities.
This adjustment ($30.3 million provisional amount recorded in the first quarter of 2018 and $0.4 million provisional amount in the third quarter of 2018) favorably impacted the third quarter and year-to-date effective tax rate by 1.5% and 61.7%, respectively.
Second, the TCJA subjected the Company’s cumulative foreign earnings to deferral income tax ($4.1 million provisional amount of which $2.9 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2018, $0.7 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2018 and $0.5 million in the third quarter of 2019) which unfavorably impacted the third quarter and year-to-date effective tax rate by 2.1% and 8.2%, respectively.
In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $2.3 million provisional estimate of the income tax effects of the future repatriation of the cumulative earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which unfavorably impacted the year-to-date effective tax rate by 4.7%.
An additional $7.5 million pension contribution for the 2017 plan year was approved during the second quarter of 2018 increasing the value of the deferred tax liability by $1.0 million.
This favorable adjustment, net of the $0.3 million unfavorable impact to the 2017 Domestic Production Deduction, favorably impacted the year-to-date effective tax rate by 1.6%.
A favorable adjustment, net of the $0.3 million unfavorable impact to the 2018 Domestic Production deduction, favorably impacted the third quarter and year-to-date effective tax rate by 2.9% and 1.4%, respectively.
The income tax expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 was favorably impacted by return to provision true-ups decreasing the third quarter and year-to-date effective tax rate by 1.4% and 0.7%, respectively.
Income tax expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 was also favorably impacted by additional tax benefits on share-based compensation that vested during the quarter decreasing the effective tax rate by 1.9% and 0.9%, respectively.

The Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and selectively uses derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts and swaps, to manage these risks.
In 2018, the Company entered into three interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $150 million to hedge some of its exposure to variability in future LIBOR-based interest payments on variable rate debt.
The Company expects hedging gains or losses to be essentially offset by losses or gains on the related underlying exposures.
All derivative instruments are reported in either accrued expenses or other receivables on the balance sheet at fair value.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until recognized in earnings with the underlying hedged item.
The interest rate swaps entered into during 2018 were not designated as cash flow hedges and, therefore, the gain or loss on the derivative is reflected in earnings each period.
​



The following is a summary of the notional transaction amounts and fair values for the Company’s outstanding derivative financial instruments by risk category and instrument type as of June 30, 2019:



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



*This swap represents a forward contract and will be effective in November 2019.
​



13.
●Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
●Level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
Financial Assets and Liabilities



The Company has estimated the fair value of its financial instruments as of June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, inventories, payables, debt and other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
18 



Fair Value of Financial Instruments



The Company’s forward contracts are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 825, as presented below as of June 30, 2019:



​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



​



Valuation was based on third party evidence of similarly priced derivative instruments.
Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities



The Company’s nonfinancial assets such as property, plant and equipment, and other intangible assets are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis; however they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence that an impairment may exist.
No impairments were recorded during the three and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2019.

Remaining Performance Obligations



Our remaining performance obligations, which is the equivalent of our backlog, represent the expected transaction price allocated to our contracts that we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods when we perform under the contracts.
These remaining obligations include amounts that have been formally appropriated under contracts with the U.S. Government, and exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts such as Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contracts.
Contract assets and liabilities



Assets and liabilities related to our contracts with customers are reported on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.
At June 30, 2019, contract assets and liabilities totaled $99.5 million and $53.8 million, respectively.
Upon adoption of ASC 606 on October 1, 2018, contract assets and liabilities related to our contracts with customers were $87 million and $51 million, respectively.
During the first nine months of 2019, we recognized approximately $35 million in revenues that were included in the contract liabilities balance at the adoption date.
Reconciliation of ASC 606 to Prior Accounting Standards

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-062, “Leases” (ASU 2016-02) which supersedes ASC 840, “Leases” and creates a new topic, ASC 842 “Leases.” Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2016-02, ASC 842 was amended by various updates that amend and clarify the impact and implementation of the aforementioned update.
These updates require lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet.
Upon initial application, the provisions of these updates are required to be applied using the modified retrospective method which requires retrospective adoption to each prior 



21 



reporting period presented with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded to the earliest reporting period presented.
An optional transition method can be utilized which requires retrospective adoption beginning on the date of adoption with the cumulative effect of initially applying these updates recognized at the date of initial adoption.
These updates also expand the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases.
These updates are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted.
We expect to adopt these updates on October 1, 2019 using the optional transition method.
​



In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which eliminates the exception for all intra-entity sale of assets other than inventory.
This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
There was no significant impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this new standard.
​
