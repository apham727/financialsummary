The purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations.
The contract maturity dates do not exceed 12 months.
As of September 28, 2018, we had outstanding the foreign exchange contracts presented in the following table.
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



(1) Expressed in units of foreign currency per U.S. dollar.
During the three months ended September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017, total net realized and unrealized transaction and foreign exchange contract currency gains and losses were not material to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks, we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures, and there can be no assurance that our mitigating activities related to the exposures that we hedge will adequately protect us against risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.

Disclosure About Other Market Risks



Variable Interest Rate Risk 



Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our term loan A-1 due 2023 bear interest at a rate per annum, at our option, of either an adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) (subject to a 0.0% floor) plus an applicable margin varying from 1.125% to 2.000% or a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 0.125% to 1.000%, in each case depending on our corporate credit ratings.
As of September 28, 2018, the applicable margin based on our current credit ratings was 1.5%.
Borrowings under our U.S.
Term Loan B-4 due 2023 bear interest at a rate per annum, at our option, of either an adjusted LIBOR (subject to a 0.0% floor) plus a margin of 1.75% or a base rate plus a margin of 0.75%.
We have generally held a balance of fixed and variable rate debt.
At September 28, 2018, 70% of the par value of our debt was at variable rates.
We entered into pay-fixed interest rate swaps, which effectively converts $1.00 billion of our term loans to fixed rates through May 2020 and an incremental $1.00 billion through April 2023.
As of September 28, 2018, we had $7.90 billion of variable rate debt.
After giving effect to the $2.00 billion of interest rate swaps, we effectively had $5.90 billion of long-term debt subject to variations in interest rates and a one percent increase in the variable rate of interest would increase annual interest expense by $59 million.
