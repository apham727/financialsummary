Forward-Looking Statements
Cognex Corporation is a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products that capture and analyze visual information in order to automate tasks, primarily in manufacturing processes, where vision is required. In addition to product revenue derived from the sale of machine vision products, the Company also generates revenue by providing maintenance and support, consulting, and training services to its customers; however, service revenue accounted for less than 10% of total revenue for all periods presented.
Cognex machine vision is primarily used to automate manufacturing and distribution processes in a variety of industries where the technology is widely recognized as an important component of automated production and quality assurance. Virtually every manufacturer can achieve better quality and manufacturing efficiency by using machine vision, and therefore, Cognex products are used by a broad base of customers across a variety of industries, including consumer electronics, automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. Cognex products are also used to automate distribution processes in the logistics industry for applications in retail distribution and ecommerce to scan, track, and sort goods through distribution centers.
Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 totaled $199,047,000, representing a decrease of 6% from the second quarter of 2018. Strong sales in the logistics industry were offset by lower sales in the consumer electronics and automotive industries, as well as the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 74% for each of the second quarter of 2019 and 2018. Operating expenses in the second quarter of 2019 increased by 3% over the second quarter of 2018 due principally to the impact of headcount additions to support our future growth plans. Operating income was 26% of revenue in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 30% of revenue in the second quarter of 2018; net income was 24% of revenue in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 27% of revenue in the second quarter of 2018; and net income per diluted share was $0.28 in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $0.32 in the second quarter of 2018.
Revenue
Sales to customers based in Europe decreased by 16% for the three-month period and 6% for the six-month period, with changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounting for approximately 6 percentage points of the decrease in both periods. On a constant-currency basis, sales to customers based in Europe decreased by 10% for the three-month period and were relatively flat for the six-month period. Lower sales in the consumer electronics industry drove the decrease in both periods, which was offset by higher sales in the logistics industry for the six-month period.
Sales to customers based in Greater China decreased by 13% for the three-month period and 14% for the six-month period, with changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounting for approximately 6 percentage points of the decrease in both periods. On a constant-currency basis, sales to customers based in Greater China decreased by 7% for the three-month period and 8% for the six-month period. Sales to customers based in other regions in Asia decreased by 7% for the three-month period and 6% for the six-month period. The decline for both periods in Greater China and other Asia was due to lower sales in the consumer electronics industry.
As of the date of this report, we expect revenue for the third quarter of 2019 to decrease from both the $199 million we reported in the second quarter of 2019 and the $232 million we reported in the third quarter of 2018. 
The decrease from the third quarter of 2018 is expected to come from significantly lower revenue in the consumer electronics industry, primarily related to smartphone manufacturing. Delays and reductions in capital spending from a broad base of factory automation customers, including those in the automotive industry, are also expected to contribute to the decrease from the prior year, offset by expected growth in the logistics industry.
The decrease from the second quarter of 2019 is expected to come from seasonal softness we typically experience in the third quarter outside of the consumer electronics industry. As of the date of this report, we believe this year’s sequential decline will be more pronounced than the prior year given current uncertainties around global growth and trade. 
Gross Margin
Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 74% for both the three-month and six-month periods in 2019 compared to 74% and 75% for the same quarters in 2018. The decline in the gross margin percentage for the six-month period was due primarily to the unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead costs, as well as the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenue, as the majority of our cost of revenue is based in U.S. Dollars. 
As of the date of this report, we expect the gross margin percentage to be in the mid 70s range for the third quarter of 2019, slightly lower than the gross margin percentage we reported in the second quarter of 2019.
Operating Expenses
Non-operating Income (Expense)
The Company recorded foreign currency gains of $140,000 and foreign currency losses of $108,000 for the three-month and six-month periods in 2019, respectively, compared to foreign currency losses of $195,000 and $329,000 for the same periods in 2018. Foreign currency gains and losses result primarily from the revaluation and settlement of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and intercompany balances that are reported in one currency and collected in another.
Investment income increased by $1,664,000, or 47%, for the three-month period and increased by $3,329,000, or 49%, for the six-month period. The increase was due to higher yields on the Company's portfolio of debt securities, and to a lesser extent additional funds available for investment.
The Company’s effective tax rate was 14% and 12% of pre-tax income for the three-month and six-month periods in 2019, respectively, compared to 16% and 11% for the same periods in 2018.
The effective tax rate included a decrease in tax expense of $1,248,000 and $3,978,000 for the three-month and six-month periods in 2019, respectively, and $654,000 and $5,589,000 for the same periods in 2018 primarily from the excess tax benefit arising from the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes from stock option exercises. The Company cannot predict the level of stock option exercises by employees in future periods. 
Excluding the impact of these discrete tax events, the Company’s effective tax rate was 17% of pre-tax income for both three-month periods and 16% for both six-month periods. 
The Company has historically been able to generate positive cash flow from operations, which has funded its operating activities and other cash requirements and has resulted in an accumulated cash and investment balance of $861,623,000 as of June 30, 2019. The Company has established guidelines relative to credit ratings, diversification, and maturities of its investments that maintain liquidity.
The Company’s cash requirements during the six months ended June 30, 2019 were primarily met with positive cash flows from operations. Cash requirements consisted of operating activities, the repurchase of common stock, the payment of dividends, and capital expenditures. Operating cash inflows included a reduction in accounts receivable from the collection of a significant amount due from a material customer in the consumer electronics industry, as well as a reduction in inventory levels. Operating cash outflows included the payment of company bonuses that were earned and accrued in 2018.

The Company may repurchase shares under this program in future periods, up to the remaining balance of $129,688,000, depending on a variety of factors, including, among other things, the impact of dilution from employee stock options, stock price, share availability, and cash requirements.
The Company’s Board of Directors declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.05 per share in both the first and second quarters of 2019, amounting to $17,146,000. Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as the Board deems relevant including, among other things, the Company’s ability to generate positive cash flows from operations.
