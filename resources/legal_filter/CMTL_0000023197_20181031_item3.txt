Item 3.
Based on the amount of outstanding debt under our Credit Facility, a hypothetical change in interest rates by 10% would change interest expense by $0.9 million over a one-year period.
Although we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes, we may choose to do so in the future in connection with our Credit Facility.
As of October 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $42.9 million, which consisted of cash and highly-liquid money market deposit accounts.
Based on our investment portfolio balance as of October 31, 2018, a hypothetical change in interest rates of 10% would have a nominal impact on interest income over a one-year period.
Ultimately, the availability of our cash and cash equivalents is dependent on a well-functioning liquid market.
